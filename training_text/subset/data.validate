 applying to her; for, as she
is, perhaps, the vainest woman upon earth, your bounty may probably do
you little service, nay, may rather actually disoblige her. Vanity is
plainly her predominant passion, and, if you will administer to that,
it will infallibly throw her into your arms. To this I attribute my own
unfortunate success. While she relieved my wants and distresses she was
daily feeding her own vanity; whereas, as every gift of yours asserted
your superiority, it rather offended than pleased her. Indeed, women
generally love to be of the obliging side; and, if we examine their
favourites, we shall find them to be much oftener such as they have
conferred obligations on than such as they have received them from."

There was something in this speech which pleased the colonel; and he
said, with a smile, "I don't know how it is, Will, but you know women
better than I."--"Perhaps, colonel," answered Booth, "I have studied
their minds more."--"I don't, however, much envy your knowledge,"
replied the other, "for I never think their minds worth considering.
However, I hope I shall profit a little by your experience with Miss
Matthews. Damnation seize the proud insolent harlot! the devil take me
if I don't love her more than I ever loved a woman!"

The rest of their conversation turned on Booth's affairs. The colonel
again reassumed the part of a friend, gave him the remainder of the
money, and promised to take the first opportunity of laying his memorial
before a great man.

Booth was greatly overjoyed at this success. Nothing now lay on his
mind but to conceal his frailty from Amelia, to whom he was afraid Miss
Matthews, in the rage of her resentment, would communicate it. This
apprehension made him stay almost constantly at home; and he trembled
at every knock at the door. His fear, moreover, betrayed him into a
meanness which he would have heartily despised on any other occasion.
This was to order the maid to deliver him any letter directed to Amelia;
at the same time strictly charging her not to acquaint her mistress with
her having received any such orders.

A servant of any acuteness would have formed strange conjectures from
such an injunction; but this poor girl was of perfect simplicity; so
great, indeed, was her simplicity, that, had not Amelia been void of all
suspicion of her husband, the maid would have soon after betrayed her
master.

One afternoon, while they were drinking tea, little Betty, so was
the maid called, came into the room, and, calling her master forth,
delivered him a card which was directed to Amelia. Booth, having read
the card, on his return into the room chid the girl for calling him,
saying "If you can read, child, you must see it was directed to your
mistress." To this the girl answered, pertly enough, "I am sure, sir,
you ordered me to bring every letter first to you." This hint, with many
women, would have been sufficient to have blown up the whole affair;
but Amelia, who heard what the girl said, through the medium of love and
confidence, saw the matter in a much better light than it deserved, and,
looking tenderly on her husband, said, "Indeed, my love, I must blame
you for a conduct which, perhaps, I ought rather to praise, as it
proceeds only from the extreme tenderness of your affection. But why
will you endeavour to keep any secrets from me? believe me, for my own
sake, you ought not; for, as you cannot hide the consequences, you make
me always suspect ten times worse than the reality. While I have you and
my children well before my eyes, I am capable of facing any news which
can arrive; for what ill news can come (unless, indeed, it concerns my
little babe in the country) which doth not relate to the badness of our
circumstances? and those, I thank Heaven, we have now a fair prospect
of retrieving. Besides, dear Billy, though my understanding be much
inferior to yours, I have sometimes had the happiness of luckily hitting
on some argument which hath afforded you comfort. This, you know, my
dear, was the case with regard to Colonel James, whom I persuaded you to
think you had mistaken, and you see the event proved me in the right."
So happily, both for herself and Mr. Booth, did the excellence of this
good woman's disposition deceive her, and force her to see everything in
the most advantageous light to her husband.

The card, being now inspected, was found to contain the compliments of
Mrs. James to Mrs. Booth, with an account of her being arrived in town,
and having brought with her a very great cold. Amelia was overjoyed at
the news of her arrival, and having drest herself in the utmost hurry,
left her children to the care of her husband, and ran away to pay her
respects to her friend, whom she loved with a most sincere affection.
But how was she disappointed when, eager with the utmost impatience, and
exulting with the thoughts of presently seeing her beloved friend, she
was answered at the door that the lady was not at home! nor could she,
upon telling her name, obtain any admission. This, considering the
account she had received of the lady's cold, greatly surprized her; and
she returned home very much vexed at her disappointment.

Amelia, who had no suspicion that Mrs. James was really at home, and,
as the phrase is, was denied, would have made a second visit the next
morning, had she not been prevented by a cold which she herself now got,
and which was attended with a slight fever. This confined her several
days to her house, during which Booth officiated as her nurse, and never
stirred from her.

In all this time she heard not a word from Mrs. James, which gave her
some uneasiness, but more astonishment. The tenth day, when she was
perfectly recovered, about nine in the evening, when she and her husband
were just going to supper, she heard a most violent thundering at the
door, and presently after a rustling of silk upon her staircase; at the
same time a female voice cried out pretty loud, "Bless me! what, am I to
climb up another pair of stairs?" upon which Amelia, who well knew
the voice, presently ran to the door, and ushered in Mrs. James, most
splendidly drest, who put on as formal a countenance, and made as formal
a courtesie to her old friend, as if she had been her very distant
acquaintance.

Poor Amelia, who was going to rush into her friend's arms, was struck
motionless by this behaviour; but re-collecting her spirits, as she had
an excellent presence of mind, she presently understood what the lady
meant, and resolved to treat her in her own way. Down therefore the
company sat, and silence prevailed for some time, during which Mrs.
James surveyed the room with more attention than she would have bestowed
on one much finer. At length the conversation began, in which the
weather and the diversions of the town were well canvassed. Amelia, who
was a woman of great humour, performed her part to admiration; so that a
by-stander would have doubted, in every other article than dress, which
of the two was the most accomplished fine lady.

After a visit of twenty minutes, during which not a word of any former
occurrences was mentioned, nor indeed any subject of discourse started,
except only those two above mentioned, Mrs. James rose from her chair
and retired in the same formal manner in which she had approached. We
will pursue her for the sake of the contrast during the rest of the
evening. She went from Amelia directly to a rout, where she spent two
hours in a croud of company, talked again and again over the diversions
and news of the town, played two rubbers at whist, and then retired
to her own apartment, where, having past another hour in undressing
herself, she went to her own bed.

Booth and his wife, the moment their companion was gone, sat down to
supper on a piece of cold meat, the remains of their dinner. After
which, over a pint of wine, they entertained themselves for a while with
the ridiculous behaviour of their visitant. But Amelia, declaring she
rather saw her as the object of pity than anger, turned the discourse
to pleasanter topics. The little actions of their children, the former
scenes and future prospects of their life, furnished them with many
pleasant ideas; and the contemplation of Amelia's recovery threw Booth
into raptures. At length they retired, happy in each other.

It is possible some readers may be no less surprized at the behaviour of
Mrs. James than was Amelia herself, since they may have perhaps received
so favourable an impression of that lady from the account given of
her by Mr. Booth, that her present demeanour may seem unnatural and
inconsistent with her former character. But they will be pleased to
consider the great alteration in her circumstances, from a state of
dependency on a brother, who was himself no better than a soldier of
fortune, to that of being wife to a man of a very large estate and
considerable rank in life. And what was her present behaviour more
than that of a fine lady who considered form and show as essential
ingredients of human happiness, and imagined all friendship to consist
in ceremony, courtesies, messages, and visits? in which opinion, she
hath the honour to think with much the larger part of one sex, and no
small number of the other.




Chapter vii.

_Containing a very extraordinary and pleasant incident._


The next evening Booth and Amelia went to walk in the park with their
children. They were now on the verge of the parade, and Booth was
describing to his wife the several buildings round it, when, on a
sudden, Amelia, missing her little boy, cried out, "Where's little
Billy?" Upon which, Booth, casting his eyes over the grass, saw a
foot-soldier shaking the boy at a little distance. At this sight,
without making any answer to his wife, he leapt over the rails, and,
running directly up to the fellow, who had a firelock with a bayonet
fixed in his hand, he seized him by the collar and tript up his heels,
and, at the same time, wrested his arms from him. A serjeant upon duty,
seeing the affray at some distance, ran presently up, and, being told
what had happened, gave the centinel a hearty curse, and told him he
deserved to be hanged. A by-stander gave this information; for Booth was
returned with his little boy to meet Amelia, who staggered towards
him as fast as she could, all pale and breathless, and scarce able to
support her tottering limbs. The serjeant now came up to Booth, to
make an apology for the behaviour of the soldier, when, of a sudden, he
turned almost as pale as Amelia herself. He stood silent whilst Booth
was employed in comforting and recovering his wife; and then, addressing
himself to him, said, "Bless me! lieutenant, could I imagine it had been
your honour; and was it my little master that the rascal used so?--I am
glad I did not know it, for I should certainly have run my halbert into
him."

Booth presently recognised his old faithful servant Atkinson, and gave
him a hearty greeting, saying he was very glad to see him in his present
situation. "Whatever I am," answered the serjeant, "I shall always think
I owe it to your honour." Then, taking the little boy by the hand he
cried, "What a vast fine young gentleman master is grown!" and, cursing
the soldier's inhumanity, swore heartily he would make him pay for it.

As Amelia was much disordered with her fright, she did not recollect her
foster-brother till he was introduced to her by Booth; but she no sooner
knew him than she bestowed a most obliging smile on him; and, calling
him by the name of honest Joe, said she was heartily glad to see him in
England. "See, my dear," cries Booth, "what preferment your old friend
is come to. You would scarce know him, I believe, in his present state
of finery." "I am very well pleased to see it," answered Amelia, "and I
wish him joy of being made an officer with all my heart." In fact, from
what Mr. Booth said, joined to the serjeant's laced coat, she believed
that he had obtained a commission. So weak and absurd is human vanity,
that this mistake of Amelia's possibly put poor Atkinson out of
countenance, for he looked at this instant more silly than he had
ever done in his life; and, making her a most respectful bow, muttered
something about obligations, in a scarce articulate or intelligible
manner.

The serjeant had, indeed, among many other qualities, that modesty which
a Latin author honours by the name of ingenuous: nature had given
him this, notwithstanding the meanness of his birth; and six years'
conversation in the army had not taken it away. To say the truth, he
was a noble fellow; and Amelia, by supposing he had a commission in the
guards, had been guilty of no affront to that honourable body.

Booth had a real affection for Atkinson, though, in fact, he knew not
half his merit. He acquainted him with his lodgings, where he earnestly
desired to see him.

[Illustration: _He seized him by the collar._]

Amelia, who was far from being recovered from the terrors into which the
seeing her husband engaged with the soldier had thrown her, desired to
go home: nor was she well able to walk without some assistance. While
she supported herself, therefore, on her husband's arm, she told
Atkinson she should be obliged to him if he would take care of the
children. He readily accepted the office; but, upon offering his hand
to miss, she refused, and burst into tears. Upon which the tender mother
resigned Booth to her children, and put herself under the serjeant's
protection; who conducted her safe home, though she often declared she
feared she should drop down by the way; the fear of which so affected
the serjeant (for, besides the honour which he himself had for the lady,
he knew how tenderly his friend loved her) that he was unable to speak;
and, had not his nerves been so strongly braced that nothing could shake
them, he had enough in his mind to have set him a trembling equally with
the lady.

When they arrived at the lodgings the mistress of the house opened the
door, who, seeing Amelia's condition, threw open the parlour and begged
her to walk in, upon which she immediately flung herself into a chair,
and all present thought she would have fainted away. However, she
escaped that misery, and, having drank a glass of water with a little
white wine mixed in it, she began in a little time to regain her
complexion, and at length assured Booth that she was perfectly
recovered, but declared she had never undergone so much, and earnestly
begged him never to be so rash for the future. She then called her
little boy and gently chid him, saying, "You must never do so more,
Billy; you see what mischief you might have brought upon your father,
and what you have made me suffer." "La! mamma," said the child, "what
harm did I do? I did not know that people might not walk in the green
fields in London. I am sure if I did a fault, the man punished me enough
for it, for he pinched me almost through my slender arm." He then bared
his little arm, which was greatly discoloured by the injury it had
received. Booth uttered a most dreadful execration at this sight, and
the serjeant, who was now present, did the like.

Atkinson now returned to his guard and went directly to the officer
to acquaint him with the soldier's inhumanity, but he, who was about
fifteen years of age, gave the serjeant a great curse and said the
soldier had done very well, for that idle boys ought to be corrected.
This, however, did not satisfy poor Atkinson, who, the next day, as soon
as the guard was relieved, beat the fellow most unmercifully, and told
him he would remember him as long as he stayed in the regiment.

Thus ended this trifling adventure, which some readers will, perhaps,
be pleased at seeing related at full length. None, I think, can
fail drawing one observation from it, namely, how capable the most
insignificant accident is of disturbing human happiness, and of
producing the most unexpected and dreadful events. A reflexion which may
serve to many moral and religious uses.

This accident produced the first acquaintance between the mistress of
the house and her lodgers; for hitherto they had scarce exchanged a
word together. But the great concern which the good woman had shewn
on Amelia's account at this time, was not likely to pass unobserved or
unthanked either by the husband or wife. Amelia, therefore, as soon as
she was able to go up-stairs, invited Mrs. Ellison (for that was her
name) to her apartment, and desired the favour of her to stay to supper.
She readily complied, and they past a very agreeable evening together,
in which the two women seemed to have conceived a most extraordinary
liking to each other.

Though beauty in general doth not greatly recommend one woman to
another, as it is too apt to create envy, yet, in cases where this
passion doth not interfere, a fine woman is often a pleasing object even
to some of her own sex, especially when her beauty is attended with a
certain air of affability, as was that of Amelia in the highest degree.
She was, indeed, a most charming woman; and I know not whether the
little scar on her nose did not rather add to than diminish her beauty.

Mrs. Ellison, therefore, was as much charmed with the loveliness of her
fair lodger as with all her other engaging qualities. She was, indeed,
so taken with Amelia's beauty, that she could not refrain from crying
out in a kind of transport of admiration, "Upon my word, Captain
Booth, you are the happiest man in the world! Your lady is so extremely
handsome that one cannot look at her without pleasure."

This good woman had herself none of these attractive charms to the eye.
Her person was short and immoderately fat; her features were none of the
most regular; and her complexion (if indeed she ever had a good one) had
considerably suffered by time.

Her good humour and complaisance, however, were highly pleasing to
Amelia. Nay, why should we conceal the secret satisfaction which that
lady felt from the compliments paid to her person? since such of my
readers as like her best will not be sorry to find that she was a woman.




Chapter viii.

_Containing various matters._


A fortnight had now passed since Booth had seen or heard from the
colonel, which did not a little surprize him, as they had parted so good
friends, and as he had so cordially undertaken his cause concerning the
memorial on which all his hopes depended.

The uneasiness which this gave him farther encreased on finding that his
friend refused to see him; for he had paid the colonel a visit at nine
in the morning, and was told he was not stirring; and at his return back
an hour afterwards the servant said his master was gone out, of which
Booth was certain of the falsehood; for he had, during that whole hour,
walked backwards and forwards within sight of the colonel's door, and
must have seen him if he had gone out within that time.

The good colonel, however, did not long suffer his friend to continue
in the deplorable state of anxiety; for, the very next morning, Booth
received his memorial enclosed in a letter, acquainting him that Mr.
James had mentioned his affair to the person he proposed, but that the
great man had so many engagements on his hands that it was impossible
for him to make any further promises at this time.

The cold and distant stile of this letter, and, indeed, the whole
behaviour of James, so different from what it had been formerly, had
something so mysterious in it, that it greatly puzzled and perplexed
poor Booth; and it was so long before he was able to solve it, that the
reader's curiosity will, perhaps, be obliged to us for not leaving him
so long in the dark as to this matter. The true reason, then, of the
colonel's conduct was this: his unbounded generosity, together with
the unbounded extravagance and consequently the great necessity of Miss
Matthews, had at length overcome the cruelty of that lady, with whom he
likewise had luckily no rival. Above all, the desire of being revenged
on Booth, with whom she was to the highest degree enraged, had,
perhaps, contributed not a little to his success; for she had no sooner
condescended to a familiarity with her new lover, and discovered that
Captain James, of whom she had heard so much from Booth, was no other
than the identical colonel, than she employed every art of which she was
mistress to make an utter breach of friendship between these two. For
this purpose she did not scruple to insinuate that the colonel was not
at all obliged to the character given of him by his friend, and to the
account of this latter she placed most of the cruelty which she had
shewn to the former.

Had the colonel made a proper use of his reason, and fairly examined
the probability of the fact, he could scarce have been imposed upon to
believe a matter so inconsistent with all he knew of Booth, and in which
that gentleman must have sinned against all the laws of honour without
any visible temptation. But, in solemn fact, the colonel was so
intoxicated with his love, that it was in the power of his mistress to
have persuaded him of anything; besides, he had an interest in giving
her credit, for he was not a little pleased with finding a reason for
hating the man whom he could not help hating without any reason,
at least, without any which he durst fairly assign even to himself.
Henceforth, therefore, he abandoned all friendship for Booth, and was
more inclined to put him out of the world than to endeavour any longer
at supporting him in it.

Booth communicated this letter to his wife, who endeavoured, as usual,
to the utmost of her power, to console him under one of the greatest
afflictions which, I think, can befal a man, namely, the unkindness of a
friend; but he had luckily at the same time the greatest blessing in
his possession, the kindness of a faithful and beloved wife. A blessing,
however, which, though it compensates most of the evils of life, rather
serves to aggravate the misfortune of distressed circumstances, from the
consideration of the share which she is to bear in them.

This afternoon Amelia received a second visit from Mrs. Ellison, who
acquainted her that she had a present of a ticket for the oratorio,
which would carry two persons into the gallery; and therefore begged the
favour of her company thither.

Amelia, with many thanks, acknowledged the civility of Mrs. Ellison, but
declined accepting her offer; upon which Booth very strenuously insisted
on her going, and said to her, "My dear, if you knew the satisfaction I
have in any of your pleasures, I am convinced you would not refuse the
favour Mrs. Ellison is so kind to offer you; for, as you are a lover of
music, you, who have never been at an oratorio, cannot conceive how
you will be delighted." "I well know your goodness, my dear," answered
Amelia, "but I cannot think of leaving my children without some person
more proper to take care of them than this poor girl." Mrs. Ellison
removed this objection by offering her own servant, a very discreet
matron, to attend them; but notwithstanding this, and all she could say,
with the assistance of Booth, and of the children themselves, Amelia
still persisted in her refusal; and the mistress of the house, who knew
how far good breeding allows persons to be pressing on these occasions,
took her leave.

She was no sooner departed than Amelia, looking tenderly on her husband,
said, "How can you, my dear creature, think that music hath any charms
for me at this time? or, indeed, do you believe that I am capable of any
sensation worthy the name of pleasure when neither you nor my children
are present or bear any part of it?"

An officer of the regiment to which Booth had formerly belonged, hearing
from Atkinson where he lodged, now came to pay him a visit. He told him
that several of their old acquaintance were to meet the next Wednesday
at a tavern, and very strongly pressed him to be one of the company.
Booth was, in truth, what is called a hearty fellow, and loved now and
then to take a chearful glass with his friends; but he excused himself
at this time. His friend declared he would take no denial, and he
growing very importunate, Amelia at length seconded him. Upon this Booth
answered, "Well, my dear, since you desire me, I will comply, but on one
condition, that you go at the same time to the oratorio." Amelia thought
this request reasonable enough, and gave her consent; of which Mrs.
Ellison presently received the news, and with great satisfaction.

It may perhaps be asked why Booth could go to the tavern, and not to the
oratorio with his wife? In truth, then, the tavern was within hallowed
ground, that is to say, in the verge of the court; for, of five officers
that were to meet there, three, besides Booth, were confined to that air
which hath been always found extremely wholesome to a broken military
constitution. And here, if the good reader will pardon the pun, he will
scarce be offended at the observation; since, how is it possible that,
without running in debt, any person should maintain the dress and
appearance of a gentleman whose income is not half so good as that of
a porter? It is true that this allowance, small as it is, is a great
expense to the public; but, if several more unnecessary charges were
spared, the public might, perhaps, bear a little encrease of this
without much feeling it. They would not, I am sure, have equal reason to
complain at contributing to the maintenance of a sett of brave fellows,
who, at the hazard of their health, their limbs, and their lives, have
maintained the safety and honour of their country, as when they find
themselves taxed to the support of a sett of drones, who have not the
least merit or claim to their favour, and who, without contributing in
any manner to the good of the hive, live luxuriously on the labours of
the industrious bee.




Chapter ix.

_In which Amelia, with her friend, goes to the oratorio._


Nothing happened between the Monday and the Wednesday worthy a place in
this history. Upon the evening of the latter the two ladies went to the
oratorio, and were there time enough to get a first row in the gallery.
Indeed, there was only one person in the house when they came; for
Amelia's inclinations, when she gave a loose to them, were pretty eager
for this diversion, she being a great lover of music, and particularly
of Mr. Handel's compositions. Mrs. Ellison was, I suppose, a great lover
likewise of music, for she was the more impatient of the two; which was
rather the more extraordinary; as these entertainments were not such
novelties to her as they were to poor Amelia.

Though our ladies arrived full two hours before they saw the back of
Mr. Handel, yet this time of expectation did not hang extremely heavy
on their hands; for, besides their own chat, they had the company of
the gentleman whom they found at their first arrival in the gallery,
and who, though plainly, or rather roughly dressed, very luckily for the
women, happened to be not only well-bred, but a person of very lively
conversation. The gentleman, on his part, seemed highly charmed with
Amelia, and in fact was so, for, though he restrained himself entirely
within the rules of good breeding, yet was he in the highest degree
officious to catch at every opportunity of shewing his respect, and
doing her little services. He procured her a book and wax-candle, and
held the candle for her himself during the whole entertainment.

At the end of the oratorio he declared he would not leave the ladies
till he had seen them safe into their chairs or coach; and at the same
time very earnestly entreated that he might have the honour of waiting
on them. Upon which Mrs. Ellison, who was a very good-humoured woman,
answered, "Ay, sure, sir, if you please; you have been very obliging to
us; and a dish of tea shall be at your service at any time;" and then
told him where she lived.

The ladies were no sooner seated in their hackney coach than Mrs.
Ellison burst into a loud laughter, and cried, "I'll be hanged, madam,
if you have not made a conquest to-night; and what is very pleasant, I
believe the poor gentleman takes you for a single lady." "Nay," answered
Amelia very gravely, "I protest I began to think at last he was rather
too particular, though he did not venture at a word that I could be
offended at; but, if you fancy any such thing, I am sorry you invited
him to drink tea," "Why so?" replied Mrs. Ellison. "Are you angry with a
man for liking you? if you are, you will be angry with almost every
man that sees you. If I was a man myself, I declare I should be in the
number of your admirers. Poor gentleman, I pity him heartily; he little
knows that you have not a heart to dispose of. For my own part, I should
not be surprized at seeing a serious proposal of marriage: for I am
convinced he is a man of fortune, not only by the politeness of his
address, but by the fineness of his linen, and that valuable diamond
ring on his finger. But you will see more of him when he comes to tea."
"Indeed I shall not," answered Amelia, "though I believe you only rally
me; I hope you have a better opinion of me than to think I would go
willingly into the company of a man who had an improper liking for me."
Mrs. Ellison, who was one of the gayest women in the world, repeated the
words, improper liking, with a laugh; and cried, "My dear Mrs. Booth,
believe me, you are too handsome and too good-humoured for a prude. How
can you affect being offended at what I am convinced is the greatest
pleasure of womankind, and chiefly, I believe, of us virtuous women?
for, I assure you, notwithstanding my gaiety, I am as virtuous as any
prude in Europe." "Far be it from me, madam," said Amelia, "to suspect
the contrary of abundance of women who indulge themselves in much
greater freedoms than I should take, or have any pleasure in taking; for
I solemnly protest, if I know my own heart, the liking of all men, but
of one, is a matter quite indifferent to me, or rather would be highly
disagreeable."

This discourse brought them home, where Amelia, finding her children
asleep, and her husband not returned, invited her companion to partake
of her homely fare, and down they sat to supper together. The clock
struck twelve; and, no news being arrived of Booth, Mrs. Ellison began
to express some astonishment at his stay, whence she launched into
a general reflexion on husbands, and soon passed to some particular
invectives on her own. "Ah, my dear madam," says she, "I know the
present state of your mind, by what I have myself often felt formerly.
I am no stranger to the melancholy tone of a midnight clock. It was my
misfortune to drag on a heavy chain above fifteen years with a sottish
yoke-fellow. But how can I wonder at my fate, since I see even your
superior charms cannot confine a husband from the bewitching pleasures
of a bottle?" "Indeed, madam," says Amelia, "I have no reason to
complain; Mr. Booth is one of the soberest of men; but now and then to
spend a late hour with his friend is, I think, highly excusable." "O,
no doubt! "cries Mrs. Ellison, "if he can excuse himself; but if I was
a man--" Here Booth came in and interrupted the discourse. Amelia's
eyes flashed with joy the moment he appeared; and he discovered no less
pleasure in seeing her. His spirits were indeed a little elevated
with wine, so as to heighten his good humour, without in the least
disordering his understanding, and made him such delightful company,
that, though it was past one in the morning, neither his wife nor Mrs.
Ellison thought of their beds during a whole hour.

Early the next morning the serjeant came to Mr. Booth's lodgings, and
with a melancholy countenance acquainted him that he had been the night
before at an alehouse, where he heard one Mr. Murphy, an attorney,
declare that he would get a warrant backed against one Captain Booth at
the next board of greencloth. "I hope, sir," said he, "your honour will
pardon me, but, by what he said, I was afraid he meant your honour; and
therefore I thought it my duty to tell you; for I knew the same thing
happen to a gentleman here the other day."

Booth gave Mr. Atkinson many thanks for his information. "I doubt not,"
said he, "but I am the person meant; for it would be foolish in me to
deny that I am liable to apprehensions of that sort." "I hope, sir,"
said the serjeant, "your honour will soon have reason to fear no man
living; but in the mean time, if any accident should happen, my bail is
at your service as far as it will go; and I am a housekeeper, and
can swear myself worth one hundred pounds." Which hearty and friendly
declaration received all those acknowledgments from Booth which it
really deserved.

The poor gentleman was greatly alarmed at the news; but he was
altogether as much surprized at Murphy's being the attorney employed
against him, as all his debts, except only to Captain James, arose in
the country, where he did not know that Mr. Murphy had any acquaintance.
However, he made no doubt that he was the person intended, and resolved
to remain a close prisoner in his own lodgings, till he saw the event
of a proposal which had been made him the evening before at the tavern,
where an honest gentleman, who had a post under the government, and who
was one of the company, had promised to serve him with the secretary at
war, telling him that he made no doubt of procuring him whole pay in
a regiment abroad, which in his present circumstances was very highly
worth his acceptance, when, indeed, that and a gaol seemed to be the
only alternatives that offered themselves to his choice.

Mr. Booth and his lady spent that afternoon with Mrs. Ellison--an
incident which we should scarce have mentioned, had it not been that
Amelia gave, on this occasion, an instance of that prudence which should
never be off its guard in married women of delicacy; for, before she
would consent to drink tea with Mrs. Ellison, she made conditions that
the gentleman who had met them at the oratorio should not be let in.
Indeed, this circumspection proved unnecessary in the present instance,
for no such visitor ever came; a circumstance which gave great content
to Amelia; for that lady had been a little uneasy at the raillery of
Mrs. Ellison, and had upon reflexion magnified every little compliment
made her, and every little civility shewn her by the unknown gentleman,
far beyond the truth. These imaginations now all subsided again; and she
imputed all that Mrs. Ellison had said either to raillery or mistake.

A young lady made a fourth with them at whist, and likewise stayed
the whole evening. Her name was Bennet. She was about the age of
five-and-twenty; but sickness had given her an older look, and had a
good deal diminished her beauty; of which, young as she was, she plainly
appeared to have only the remains in her present possession. She was
in one particular the very reverse of Mrs. Ellison, being altogether as
remarkably grave as the other was gay. This gravity was not, however,
attended with any sourness of temper; on the contrary, she had much
sweetness in her countenance, and was perfectly well bred. In short,
Amelia imputed her grave deportment to her ill health, and began to
entertain a compassion for her, which in good minds, that is to say, in
minds capable of compassion, is certain to introduce some little degree
of love or friendship.

Amelia was in short so pleased with the conversation of this lady, that,
though a woman of no impertinent curiosity, she could not help taking
the first opportunity of enquiring who she was. Mrs. Ellison said that
she was an unhappy lady, who had married a young clergyman for love,
who, dying of a consumption, had left her a widow in very indifferent
circumstances. This account made Amelia still pity her more, and
consequently added to the liking which she had already conceived for
her. Amelia, therefore, desired Mrs. Ellison to bring her acquainted
with Mrs. Bennet, and said she would go any day with her to make that
lady a visit. "There need be no ceremony," cried Mrs. Ellison; "she is
a woman of no form; and, as I saw plainly she was extremely pleased with
Mrs. Booth, I am convinced I can bring her to drink tea with you any
afternoon you please."

The two next days Booth continued at home, highly to the satisfaction of
his Amelia, who really knew no happiness out of his company, nor scarce
any misery in it. She had, indeed, at all times so much of his company,
when in his power, that she had no occasion to assign any particular
reason for his staying with her, and consequently it could give her
no cause of suspicion. The Saturday, one of her children was a little
disordered with a feverish complaint which confined her to her room,
and prevented her drinking tea in the afternoon with her husband in Mrs.
Ellison's apartment, where a noble lord, a cousin of Mrs. Ellison's,
happened to be present; for, though that lady was reduced in her
circumstances and obliged to let out part of her house in lodgings, she
was born of a good family and had some considerable relations.

His lordship was not himself in any office of state, but his fortune
gave him great authority with those who were. Mrs. Ellison, therefore,
very bluntly took an opportunity of recommending Booth to his
consideration. She took the first hint from my lord's calling the
gentleman captain; to which she answered, "Ay, I wish your lordship
would make him so. It would be an act of justice, and I know it is
in your power to do much greater things." She then mentioned Booth's
services, and the wounds he had received at the siege, of which she had
heard a faithful account from Amelia. Booth blushed, and was as silent
as a young virgin at the hearing her own praises. His lordship answered,
"Cousin Ellison, you know you may command my interest; nay, I shall have
a pleasure in serving one of Mr. Booth's character: for my part, I think
merit in all capacities ought to be encouraged, but I know the ministry
are greatly pestered with solicitations at this time. However, Mr. Booth
may be assured I will take the first opportunity; and in the mean time,
I shall be glad of seeing him any morning he pleases." For all these
declarations Booth was not wanting in acknowledgments to the generous
peer any more than he was in secret gratitude to the lady who had shewn
so friendly and uncommon a zeal in his favour.

The reader, when he knows the character of this nobleman, may, perhaps,
conclude that his seeing Booth alone was a lucky circumstance, for he
was so passionate an admirer of women, that he could scarce have escaped
the attraction of Amelia's beauty. And few men, as I have observed, have
such disinterested generosity as to serve a husband the better because
they are in love with his wife, unless she will condescend to pay a
price beyond the reach of a virtuous woman.

BOOK V.



Chapter i.

_In which the reader will meet with an old acquaintance._


Booth's affairs were put on a better aspect than they had ever worn
before, and he was willing to make use of the opportunity of one day in
seven to taste the fresh air.

At nine in the morning he went to pay a visit to his old friend Colonel
James, resolving, if possible, to have a full explanation of that
behaviour which appeared to him so mysterious: but the colonel was as
inaccessible as the best defended fortress; and it was as impossible
for Booth to pass beyond his entry as the Spaniards found it to take
Gibraltar. He received the usual answers; first, that the colonel was
not stirring, and an hour after that he was gone out. All that he got
by asking further questions was only to receive still ruder answers, by
which, if he had been very sagacious, he might have been satisfied how
little worth his while it was to desire to go in; for the porter at a
great man's door is a kind of thermometer, by which you may discover
the warmth or coldness of his master's friendship. Nay, in the highest
stations of all, as the great man himself hath his different kinds of
salutation, from an hearty embrace with a kiss, and my dear lord or dear
Sir Charles, down to, well Mr.----, what would you have me do? so the
porter to some bows with respect, to others with a smile, to some he
bows more, to others less low, to others not at all. Some he just
lets in, and others he just shuts out. And in all this they so well
correspond, that one would be inclined to think that the great man
and his porter had compared their lists together, and, like two actors
concerned to act different parts in the same scene, had rehearsed their
parts privately together before they ventured to perform in public.

Though Booth did not, perhaps, see the whole matter in this just light,
for that in reality it is, yet he was discerning enough to conclude,
from the behaviour of the servant, especially when he considered that of
the master likewise, that he had entirely lost the friendship of James;
and this conviction gave him a concern that not only the flattering
prospect of his lordship's favour was not able to compensate, but which
even obliterated, and made him for a while forget the situation in which
he had left his Amelia: and he wandered about almost two hours, scarce
knowing where he went, till at last he dropt into a coffee-house near St
James's, where he sat himself down.

He had scarce drank his dish of coffee before he heard a young officer
of the guards cry to another, "Od, d--n me, Jack, here he comes--here's
old honour and dignity, faith." Upon which he saw a chair open, and out
issued a most erect and stately figure indeed, with a vast periwig on
his head, and a vast hat under his arm. This august personage, having
entered the room, walked directly up to the upper end, where having paid
his respects to all present of any note, to each according to seniority,
he at last cast his eyes on Booth, and very civilly, though somewhat
coldly, asked him how he did.

Booth, who had long recognized the features of his old acquaintance
Major Bath, returned the compliment with a very low bow; but did not
venture to make the first advance to familiarity, as he was truly
possessed of that quality which the Greeks considered in the highest
light of honour, and which we term modesty; though indeed, neither
ours nor the Latin language hath any word adequate to the idea of the
original.

The colonel, after having discharged himself of two or three articles of
news, and made his comments upon them, when the next chair to him
became vacant, called upon Booth to fill it. He then asked him several
questions relating to his affairs; and, when he heard he was out of the
army, advised him earnestly to use all means to get in again, saying
that he was a pretty lad, and they must not lose him.

Booth told him in a whisper that he had a great deal to say to him on
that subject if they were in a more private place; upon this the colonel
proposed a walk in the Park, which the other readily accepted.

During their walk Booth opened his heart, and, among other matters,
acquainted Colonel Bath that he feared he had lost the friendship of
Colonel James; "though I am not," said he, "conscious of having done the
least thing to deserve it."

Bath answered, "You are certainly mistaken, Mr. Booth. I have indeed
scarce seen my brother since my coming to town; for I have been here but
two days; however, I am convinced he is a man of too nice honour to
do anything inconsistent with the true dignity of a gentleman."
Booth answered, "He was far from accusing him of anything
dishonourable."--"D--n me," said Bath, "if there is a man alive can or
dare accuse him: if you have the least reason to take anything ill, why
don't you go to him? you are a gentleman, and his rank doth not protect
him from giving you satisfaction." "The affair is not of any such kind,"
says Booth; "I have great obligations to the colonel, and have more
reason to lament than complain; and, if I could but see him, I am
convinced I should have no cause for either; but I cannot get within his
house; it was but an hour ago a servant of his turned me rudely from the
door." "Did a servant of my brother use you rudely?" said the colonel,
with the utmost gravity. "I do not know, sir, in what light you see
such things; but, to me, the affront of a servant is the affront of the
master; and if he doth not immediately punish it, by all the dignity of
a man, I would see the master's nose between my fingers." Booth offered
to explain, but to no purpose; the colonel was got into his stilts; and
it was impossible to take him down, nay, it was as much as Booth could
possibly do to part with him without an actual quarrel; nor would he,
perhaps, have been able to have accomplished it, had not the colonel by
accident turned at last to take Booth's side of the question; and before
they separated he swore many oaths that James should give him proper
satisfaction.

Such was the end of this present interview, so little to the content of
Booth, that he was heartily concerned he had ever mentioned a syllable
of the matter to his honourable friend.


[This chapter occurs in the original edition of _Amelia,_ between 1
and 2. It is omitted later, and would have been omitted here but for an
accident. As it had been printed it may as well appear: for though
it has no great value it may interest some readers as an additional
illustration of Fielding's dislike to doctors.--ED.

_Containing a brace of doctors and much physical matter._


He now returned with all his uneasiness to Amelia, whom he found in a
condition very little adapted to relieve or comfort him. That poor woman
was now indeed under very great apprehensions for her child, whose fever
now began to rage very violently: and what was worse, an apothecary had
been with her, and frightened her almost out of her wits. He had
indeed represented the case of the child to be very desperate, and had
prevailed on the mother to call in the assistance of a doctor.

Booth had been a very little time in the room before this doctor
arrived, with the apothecary close at his heels, and both approached the
bed, where the former felt the pulse of the sick, and performed several
other physical ceremonies.

He then began to enquire of the apothecary what he had already done for
the patient; all which, as soon as informed, he greatly approved. The
doctor then sat down, called for a pen and ink, filled a whole side of a
sheet of paper with physic, then took a guinea, and took his leave; the
apothecary waiting upon him downstairs, as he had attended him up.

All that night both Amelia and Booth sat up with their child, who rather
grew worse than better. In the morning Mrs. Ellison found the infant in
a raging fever, burning hot, and very light-headed, and the mother under
the highest dejection; for the distemper had not given the least ground
to all the efforts of the apothecary and doctor, but seemed to defy
their utmost power, with all that tremendous apparatus of phials and
gallypots, which were arranged in battle-array all over the room.

Mrs. Ellison, seeing the distrest, and indeed distracted, condition
of Amelia's mind, attempted to comfort her by giving her hopes of the
child's recovery. "Upon my word, madam," says she, "I saw a child
of much the same age with miss, who, in my opinion, was much worse,
restored to health in a few days by a physician of my acquaintance. Nay,
I have known him cure several others of very bad fevers; and, if miss
was under his care, I dare swear she would do very well." "Good heavens!
madam," answered Amelia, "why should you not mention him to me? For my
part I have no acquaintance with any London physicians, nor do I know
whom the apothecary hath brought me." "Nay, madam," cries Mrs. Ellison,
"it is a tender thing, you know, to recommend a physician; and as for my
doctor, there are abundance of people who give him an ill name. Indeed,
it is true, he hath cured me twice of fevers, and so he hath several
others to my knowledge; nay, I never heard of any more than one of his
patients that died; and yet, as the doctors and apothecaries all give
him an ill character, one is fearful, you know, dear madam." Booth
enquired the doctor's name, which he no sooner heard than he begged his
wife to send for him immediately, declaring he had heard the highest
character imaginable of him at the Tavern from an officer of very good
understanding. Amelia presently complied, and a messenger was despatched
accordingly.

But before the second doctor could be brought, the first returned with
the apothecary attending him as before. He again surveyed and handled
the sick; and when Amelia begged him to tell her if there was any hopes,
he shook his head, and said, "To be sure, madam, miss is in a very
dangerous condition, and there is no time to lose. If the blisters
which I shall now order her, should not relieve her, I fear we can do no
more."--"Would not you please, sir," says the apothecary, "to have the
powders and the draught repeated?" "How often were they ordered?" cries
the doctor. "Only _tertia_ quaq. hora," says the apothecary. "Let them
be taken every hour by all means," cries the doctor; "and--let me see,
pray get me a pen and ink."--"If you think the child in such imminent
danger," said Booth, "would you give us leave to call in another
physician to your assistance--indeed my wife"--"Oh, by all means," said
the doctor, "it is what I very much wish. Let me see, Mr. Arsenic,
whom shall we call?" "What do you think of Dr Dosewell?" said the
apothecary.--"Nobody better," cries the physician.--"I should have no
objection to the gentleman," answered Booth, "but another hath been
recommended to my wife." He then mentioned the physician for whom they
had just before sent. "Who, sir?" cries the doctor, dropping his pen;
and when Booth repeated the name of Thompson, "Excuse me, sir," cries
the doctor hastily, "I shall not meet him."--"Why so, sir?" answered
Booth. "I will not meet him," replied the doctor. "Shall I meet a man
who pretendsyes, asked how the poor creature could possibly get through such
distress.

"You may depend upon it, madam," said Mrs. Ellison, "the moment I read
this account I posted away immediately to the lady. As to the seizing
the body, that I found was a mere bugbear; but all the rest was
literally true. I sent immediately for the same gentleman that I
recommended to Mr. Booth, left the care of burying the corpse to him,
and brought my friend and her little boy immediately away to my own
house, where she remained some months in the most miserable condition.
I then prevailed with her to retire into the country, and procured her
a lodging with a friend at St Edmundsbury, the air and gaiety of which
place by degrees recovered her; and she returned in about a twelve-month
to town, as well, I think, as she is at present."

"I am almost afraid to ask," cries Amelia, "and yet I long methinks to
know what is become of the poor little boy."

"He hath been dead," said Mrs. Ellison, "a little more than half a
year; and the mother lamented him at first almost as much as she did her
husband, but I found it indeed rather an easier matter to comfort her,
though I sat up with her near a fortnight upon the latter occasion."

"You are a good creature," said Amelia, "and I love you dearly."

"Alas! madam," cries she, "what could I have done if it had not been
for the goodness of that best of men, my noble cousin! His lordship no
sooner heard of the widow's distress from me than he immediately settled
one hundred and fifty pounds a year upon her during her life."

"Well! how noble, how generous was that!" said Amelia. "I declare I
begin to love your cousin, Mrs. Ellison."

"And I declare if you do," answered she, "there is no love lost, I
verily believe; if you had heard what I heard him say yesterday behind
your back---"

"Why, what did he say, Mrs. Ellison?" cries Amelia.

"He said," answered the other, "that you was the finest woman his eyes
ever beheld.--Ah! it is in vain to wish, and yet I cannot help wishing
too.--O, Mrs. Booth! if you had been a single woman, I firmly believe I
could have made you the happiest in the world. And I sincerely think I
never saw a woman who deserved it more."

"I am obliged to you, madam," cries Amelia, "for your good opinion; but
I really look on myself already as the happiest woman in the world. Our
circumstances, it is true, might have been a little more fortunate; but
O, my dear Mrs. Ellison! what fortune can be put in the balance with
such a husband as mine?"

"I am afraid, dear madam," answered Mrs. Ellison, "you would not hold
the scale fairly.--I acknowledge, indeed, Mr. Booth is a very pretty
gentleman; Heaven forbid I should endeavour to lessen him in your
opinion; yet, if I was to be brought to confession, I could not help
saying I see where the superiority lies, and that the men have more
reason to envy Mr. Booth than the women have to envy his lady."

"Nay, I will not bear this," replied Amelia. "You will forfeit all my
love if you have the least disrespectful opinion of my husband. You do
not know him, Mrs. Ellison; he is the best, the kindest, the worthiest
of all his sex. I have observed, indeed, once or twice before, that you
have taken some dislike to him. I cannot conceive for what reason. If
he hath said or done anything to disoblige you, I am sure I can justly
acquit him of design. His extreme vivacity makes him sometimes a little
too heedless; but, I am convinced, a more innocent heart, or one more
void of offence, was never in a human bosom."

"Nay, if you grow serious," cries Mrs. Ellison, "I have done. How is it
possible you should suspect I had taken any dislike to a man to whom I
have always shewn so perfect a regard; but to say I think him, or almost
any other man in the world, worthy of yourself, is not within my power
with truth. And since you force the confession from me, I declare, I
think such beauty, such sense, and such goodness united, might aspire
without vanity to the arms of any monarch in Europe."

"Alas! my dear Mrs. Ellison," answered Amelia, "do you think happiness
and a crown so closely united? how many miserable women have lain in
the arms of kings?--Indeed, Mrs. Ellison, if I had all the merit you
compliment me with, I should think it all fully rewarded with such a man
as, I thank Heaven, hath fallen to my lot; nor would I, upon my soul,
exchange that lot with any queen in the universe."

"Well, there are enow of our sex," said Mrs. Ellison, "to keep you in
countenance; but I shall never forget the beginning of a song of Mr.
Congreve's, that my husband was so fond of that he was always singing
it:--

     Love's but a frailty of the mind,
     When 'tis not with ambition join'd.

Love without interest makes but an unsavoury dish, in my opinion."

"And pray how long hath this been your opinion?" said Amelia, smiling.

"Ever since I was born," answered Mrs. Ellison; "at least, ever since I
can remember."

"And have you never," said Amelia, "deviated from this generous way of
thinking?"

"Never once," answered the other, "in the whole course of my life."

"O, Mrs. Ellison! Mrs. Ellison!" cries Amelia; "why do we ever blame
those who are disingenuous in confessing their faults, when we are
so often ashamed to own ourselves in the right? Some women now, in my
situation, would be angry that you had not made confidantes of them;
but I never desire to know more of the secrets of others than they are
pleased to intrust me with. You must believe, however, that I should not
have given you these hints of my knowing all if I had disapproved your
choice. On the contrary, I assure you I highly approve it. The gentility
he wants, it will be easily in your power to procure for him; and as for
his good qualities, I will myself be bound for them; and I make not the
least doubt, as you have owned to me yourself that you have placed your
affections on him, you will be one of the happiest women in the world."

"Upon my honour," cries Mrs. Ellison very gravely, "I do not understand
one word of what you mean."

"Upon my honour, you astonish me," said Amelia; "but I have done."

"Nay then," said the other, "I insist upon knowing what you mean."

"Why, what can I mean," answered Amelia, "but your marriage with
serjeant Atkinson?"

"With serjeant Atkinson!" cries Mrs. Ellison eagerly, "my marriage with
a serjeant!"

"Well, with Mr. Atkinson, then, Captain Atkinson, if you please; for so
I hope to see him."

"And have you really no better opinion of me," said Mrs. Ellison, "than
to imagine me capable of such condescension? What have I done, dear
Mrs. Booth, to deserve so low a place in your esteem? I find indeed, as
Solomon says, _Women ought to watch the door of their lips._ How little
did I imagine that a little harmless freedom in discourse could persuade
any one that I could entertain a serious intention of disgracing my
family! for of a very good family am I come, I assure you, madam,
though I now let lodgings. Few of my lodgers, I believe, ever came of a
better."

"If I have offended you, madam," said Amelia, "I am very sorry, and ask
your pardon; but, besides what I heard from yourself, Mr. Booth told
me--"

"O yes!" answered Mrs. Ellison, "Mr. Booth, I know, is a very good
friend of mine. Indeed, I know you better than to think it could be your
own suspicion. I am very much obliged to Mr. Booth truly."

"Nay," cries Amelia, "the serjeant himself is in fault; for Mr. Booth, I
am positive, only repeated what he had from him."

"Impudent coxcomb!" cries Mrs. Ellison. "I shall know how to keep such
fellows at a proper distance for the future--I will tell you, dear
madam, all that happened. When I rose in the morning I found the fellow
waiting in the entry; and, as you had exprest some regard for him as
your foster-brother--nay, he is a very genteel fellow, that I must
own--I scolded my maid for not shewing him into my little back-room;
and I then asked him to walk into the parlour. Could I have imagined he
would have construed such little civility into an encouragement?"

"Nay, I will have justice done to my poor brother too," said Amelia. "I
myself have seen you give him much greater encouragement than that."

"Well, perhaps I have," said Mrs. Ellison. "I have been always too
unguarded in my speech, and can't answer for all I have said." She then
began to change her note, and, with an affected laugh, turned all into
ridicule; and soon afterwards the two ladies separated, both in apparent
good humour; and Amelia went about those domestic offices in which Mr.
Booth found her engaged at the end of the preceding chapter.




Chapter iv.

_Containing a very extraordinary incident._


In the afternoon Mr. Booth, with Amelia and her children, went to
refresh themselves in the Park. The conversation now turned on what past
in the morning with Mrs. Ellison, the latter part of the dialogue, I
mean, recorded in the last chapter. Amelia told her husband that Mrs.
Ellison so strongly denied all intentions to marry the serjeant, that
she had convinced her the poor fellow was under an error, and had
mistaken a little too much levity for serious encouragement; and
concluded by desiring Booth not to jest with her any more on that
subject.

Booth burst into a laugh at what his wife said. "My dear creature,"
said he, "how easily is thy honesty and simplicity to be imposed on! how
little dost thou guess at the art and falsehood of women! I knew a young
lady who, against her father's consent, was married to a brother officer
of mine; and, as I often used to walk with her (for I knew her father
intimately well), she would of her own accord take frequent occasions to
ridicule and vilify her husband (for so he was at the time), and exprest
great wonder and indignation at the report which she allowed to prevail
that she should condescend ever to look at such a fellow with any other
design than of laughing at and despising him. The marriage afterwards
became publicly owned, and the lady was reputably brought to bed. Since
which I have often seen her; nor hath she ever appeared to be in the
least ashamed of what she had formerly said, though, indeed, I believe
she hates me heartily for having heard it."

"But for what reason," cries Amelia, "should she deny a fact, when she
must be so certain of our discovering it, and that immediately?"

"I can't answer what end she may propose," said Booth. "Sometimes one
would be almost persuaded that there was a pleasure in lying itself. But
this I am certain, that I would believe the honest serjeant on his bare
word sooner than I would fifty Mrs. Ellisons on oath. I am convinced
he would not have said what he did to me without the strongest
encouragement; and, I think, after what we have been both witnesses to,
it requires no great confidence in his veracity to give him an unlimited
credit with regard to the lady's behaviour."

To this Amelia made no reply; and they discoursed of other matters
during the remainder of a very pleasant walk.

When they returned home Amelia was surprized to find an appearance of
disorder in her apartment. Several of the trinkets which his lordship
had given the children lay about the room; and a suit of her own
cloaths, which she had left in her drawers, was now displayed upon the
bed.

She immediately summoned her little girl up-stairs, who, as she plainly
perceived the moment she came up with a candle, had half cried her eyes
out; for, though the girl had opened the door to them, as it was
almost dark, she had not taken any notice of this phenomenon in her
countenance.

The girl now fell down upon her knees and cried, "For Heaven's sake,
madam, do not be angry with me. Indeed, I was left alone in the house;
and, hearing somebody knock at the door, I opened it--I am sure thinking
no harm. I did not know but it might have been you, or my master, or
Madam Ellison; and immediately as I did, the rogue burst in and ran
directly up-stairs, and what he hath robbed you of I cannot tell; but
I am sure I could not help it, for he was a great swinging man with
a pistol in each hand; and, if I had dared to call out, to be sure he
would have killed me. I am sure I was never in such a fright in my born
days, whereof I am hardly come to myself yet. I believe he is somewhere
about the house yet, for I never saw him go out."

Amelia discovered some little alarm at this narrative, but much less
than many other ladies would have shewn, for a fright is, I believe,
sometimes laid hold of as an opportunity of disclosing several charms
peculiar to that occasion. And which, as Mr. Addison says of certain
virtues,

     Shun the day, and lie conceal'd
     In the smooth seasons and the calms of life.

Booth, having opened the window, and summoned in two chairmen to his
assistance, proceeded to search the house; but all to no purpose; the
thief was flown, though the poor girl, in her state of terror, had not
seen him escape.

But now a circumstance appeared which greatly surprized both Booth and
Amelia; indeed, I believe it will have the same effect on the reader;
and this was, that the thief had taken nothing with him. He had, indeed,
tumbled over all Booth's and Amelia's cloaths and the children's toys,
but had left all behind him.

Amelia was scarce more pleased than astonished at this discovery,
and re-examined the girl, assuring her of an absolute pardon if she
confessed the truth, but grievously threatening her if she was found
guilty of the least falsehood. "As for a thief, child," says she, "that
is certainly not true; you have had somebody with you to whom you have
been shewing the things; therefore tell me plainly who it was."

The girl protested in the solemnest manner that she knew not the person;
but as to some circumstances she began to vary a little from her
first account, particularly as to the pistols, concerning which, being
strictly examined by Booth, she at last cried--"To be sure, sir, he must
have had pistols about him." And instead of persisting in his having
rushed in upon her, she now confessed that he had asked at the door
for her master and mistress; and that at his desire she had shewn him
up-stairs, where he at first said he would stay till their return home;
"but, indeed," cried she, "I thought no harm, for he looked like a
gentleman-like sort of man. And, indeed, so I thought he was for a good
while, whereof he sat down and behaved himself very civilly, till he saw
some of master's and miss's things upon the chest of drawers; whereof
he cried, 'Hey-day! what's here?' and then he fell to tumbling about the
things like any mad. Then I thinks, thinks I to myself, to be sure he
is a highwayman, whereof I did not dare speak to him; for I knew Madam
Ellison and her maid was gone out, and what could such a poor girl as I
do against a great strong man? and besides, thinks I, to be sure he hath
got pistols about him, though I can't indeed, (that I will not do for
the world) take my Bible-oath that I saw any; yet to be sure he would
have soon pulled them out and shot me dead if I had ventured to have
said anything to offend him."

"I know not what to make of this," cries Booth. "The poor girl, I verily
believe, speaks to the best of her knowledge. A thief it could not be,
for he hath not taken the least thing; and it is plain he had the girl's
watch in his hand. If it had been a bailiff, surely he would have staid
till our return. I can conceive no other from the girl's account than
that it must have been some madman."

"O good sir!" said the girl, "now you mention it, if he was not a thief,
to be sure he must have been a madman: for indeed he looked, and behaved
himself too, very much like a madman; for, now I remember it, he
talked to himself and said many strange kind of words that I did not
understand. Indeed, he looked altogether as I have seen people in
Bedlam; besides, if he was not a madman, what good could it do him
to throw the things all about the room in such a manner? and he said
something too about my master just before he went down-stairs. I was in
such a fright I cannot remember particularly, but I am sure they were
very ill words; he said he would do for him--I am sure he said that, and
other wicked bad words too, if I could but think of them."

"Upon my word," said Booth, "this is the most probable conjecture; but
still I am puzzled to conceive who it should be, for I have no madman
to my knowledge of my acquaintance, and it seems, as the girl says, he
asked for me." He then turned to the child, and asked her if she was
certain of that circumstance.

The poor maid, after a little hesitation, answered, "Indeed, sir, I
cannot be very positive; for the fright he threw me into afterwards
drove everything almost out of my mind."

"Well, whatever he was," cries Amelia, "I am glad the consequence is no
worse; but let this be a warning to you, little Betty, and teach you to
take more care for the future. If ever you should be left alone in the
house again, be sure to let no persons in without first looking out at
the window and seeing who they are. I promised not to chide you any
more on this occasion, and I will keep my word; but it is very plain you
desired this person to walk up into our apartment, which was very wrong
in our absence."

Betty was going to answer, but Amelia would not let her, saying, "Don't
attempt to excuse yourself; for I mortally hate a liar, and can forgive
any fault sooner than falsehood."

The poor girl then submitted; and now Amelia, with her assistance, began
to replace all things in their order; and little Emily hugging her watch
with great fondness, declared she would never part with it any more.

Thus ended this odd adventure, not entirely to the satisfaction of
Booth; for, besides his curiosity, which, when thoroughly roused, is a
very troublesome passion, he had, as is I believe usual with all persons
in his circumstances, several doubts and apprehensions of he knew not
what. Indeed, fear is never more uneasy than when it doth not certainly
know its object; for on such occasions the mind is ever employed in
raising a thousand bugbears and fantoms, much more dreadful than any
realities, and, like children when they tell tales of hobgoblins, seems
industrious in terrifying itself.




Chapter v.

_Containing some matters not very unnatural._


Matters were scarce sooner reduced into order and decency than a violent
knocking was heard at the door, such indeed as would have persuaded
any one not accustomed to the sound that the madman was returned in the
highest spring-tide of his fury.

Instead, however, of so disagreeable an appearance, a very fine lady
presently came into the room, no other, indeed, than Mrs. James herself;
for she was resolved to shew Amelia, by the speedy return of her visit,
how unjust all her accusation had been of any failure in the duties of
friendship; she had, moreover, another reason to accelerate this visit,
and that was, to congratulate her friend on the event of the duel
between Colonel Bath and Mr. Booth.

The lady had so well profited by Mrs. Booth's remonstrance, that she
had now no more of that stiffness and formality which she had worn on
a former occasion. On the contrary, she now behaved with the utmost
freedom and good-humour, and made herself so very agreeable, that Amelia
was highly pleased and delighted with her company.

An incident happened during this visit, that may appear to some too
inconsiderable in itself to be recorded; and yet, as it certainly
produced a very strong consequence in the mind of Mr. Booth, we cannot
prevail on ourselves to pass it by.

Little Emily, who was present in the room while Mrs. James was there,
as she stood near that lady happened to be playing with her watch, which
she was so greatly overjoyed had escaped safe from the madman. Mrs.
James, who exprest great fondness for the child, desired to see the
watch, which she commended as the prettiest of the kind she had ever
seen.

Amelia caught eager hold of this opportunity to spread the praises of
her benefactor. She presently acquainted Mrs. James with the donor's
name, and ran on with great encomiums on his lordship's goodness,
and particularly on his generosity. To which Mrs. James answered, "O!
certainly, madam, his lordship hath universally the character of being
extremely generous-where he likes."

In uttering these words she laid a very strong emphasis on the three
last monosyllables, accompanying them at the same time with a very
sagacious look, a very significant leer, and a great flirt with her fan.

The greatest genius the world hath ever produced observes, in one of his
most excellent plays, that

     Trifles, light as air,
     Are to the jealous confirmations strong
     As proofs of holy writ.

That Mr. Booth began to be possessed by this worst of fiends, admits, I
think, no longer doubt; for at this speech of Mrs. James he immediately
turned pale, and, from a high degree of chearfulness, was all on a
sudden struck dumb, so that he spoke not another word till Mrs. James
left the room.

The moment that lady drove from the door Mrs. Ellison came up-stairs.
She entered the room with a laugh, and very plentifully rallied both
Booth and Amelia concerning the madman, of which she had received a full
account below-stairs; and at last asked Amelia if she could not guess
who it was; but, without receiving an answer, went on, saying, "For my
own part, I fancy it must be some lover of yours! some person that hath
seen you, and so is run mad with love. Indeed, I should not wonder if
all mankind were to do the same. La! Mr. Booth, what makes you grave?
why, you are as melancholy as if you had been robbed in earnest. Upon
my word, though, to be serious, it is a strange story, and, as the girl
tells it, I know not what to make of it. Perhaps it might be some rogue
that intended to rob the house, and his heart failed him; yet even that
would be very extraordinary. What, did you lose nothing, madam?"

"Nothing at all," answered Amelia. "He did not even take the child's
watch."

"Well, captain," cries Mrs. Ellison, "I hope you will take more care of
the house to-morrow; for your lady and I shall leave you alone to the
care of it. Here, madam," said she, "here is a present from my lord to
us; here are two tickets for the masquerade at Ranelagh. You will be so
charmed with it! It is the sweetest of all diversions."

"May I be damned, madam," cries Booth, "if my wife shall go thither."

Mrs. Ellison stared at these words, and, indeed, so did Amelia; for they
were spoke with great vehemence. At length the former cried out with an
air of astonishment, "Not let your lady go to Ranelagh, sir?"

"No, madam," cries Booth, "I will not let my wife go to Ranelagh."

"You surprize me!" cries Mrs. Ellison. "Sure, you are not in earnest?"

"Indeed, madam," returned he, "I am seriously in earnest. And, what is
more, I am convinced she would of her own accord refuse to go."

"Now, madam," said Mrs. Ellison, "you are to answer for yourself: and
I will for your husband, that, if you have a desire to go, he will not
refuse you."

"I hope, madam," answered Amelia with great gravity, "I shall never
desire to go to any place contrary to Mr. Booth's inclinations."

"Did ever mortal hear the like?" said Mrs. Ellison; "you are enough to
spoil the best husband in the universe. Inclinations! what, is a woman
to be governed then by her husband's inclinations, though they are never
so unreasonable?"

"Pardon me, madam," said Amelia; "I will not suppose Mr. Booth's
inclinations ever can be unreasonable. I am very much obliged to you for
the offer you have made me; but I beg you will not mention it any more;
for, after what Mr. Booth hath declared, if Ranelagh was a heaven upon
earth, I would refuse to go to it."

"I thank you, my dear," cries Booth; "I do assure you, you oblige me
beyond my power of expression by what you say; but I will endeavour to
shew you, both my sensibility of such goodness, and my lasting gratitude
to it."

"And pray, sir," cries Mrs. Ellison, "what can be your objection to your
lady's going to a place which, I will venture to say, is as reputable as
any about town, and which is frequented by the best company?"

"Pardon me, good Mrs. Ellison," said Booth: "as my wife is so good to
acquiesce without knowing my reasons, I am not, I think, obliged to
assign them to any other person."

"Well," cries Mrs. Ellison, "if I had been told this, I would not have
believed it. What, refuse your lady an innocent diversion, and that too
when you have not the pretence to say it would cost you a farthing?"

"Why will you say any more on this subject, dear madam?" cries Amelia.
"All diversions are to me matters of such indifference, that the bare
inclinations of any one for whom I have the least value would at all
times turn the balance of mine. I am sure then, after what Mr. Booth
hath said--"

"My dear," cries he, taking her up hastily, "I sincerely ask your
pardon; I spoke inadvertently, and in a passion. I never once thought
of controuling you, nor ever would. Nay, I said in the same breath you
would not go; and, upon my honour, I meant nothing more."

"My dear," said she, "you have no need of making any apology. I am not
in the least offended, and am convinced you will never deny me what I
shall desire."

"Try him, try him, madam," cries Mrs. Ellison; "I will be judged by
all the women in town if it is possible for a wife to ask her husband
anything more reasonable. You can't conceive what a sweet, charming,
elegant, delicious place it is. Paradise itself can hardly be equal to
it."

"I beg you will excuse me, madam," said Amelia; "nay, I entreat you will
ask me no more; for be assured I must and will refuse. Do let me desire
you to give the ticket to poor Mrs. Bennet. I believe it would greatly
oblige her."

"Pardon me, madam," said Mrs. Ellison; "if you will not accept of it, I
am not so distressed for want of company as to go to such a public
place with all sort of people neither. I am always very glad to see Mrs.
Bennet at my own house, because I look upon her as a very good sort of
woman; but I don't chuse to be seen with such people in public places."

Amelia exprest some little indignation at this last speech, which she
declared to be entirely beyond her comprehension; and soon after, Mrs.
Ellison, finding all her efforts to prevail on Amelia were ineffectual,
took her leave, giving Mr. Booth two or three sarcastical words, and a
much more sarcastical look, at her departure.




Chapter vi.

_A scene in which some ladies will possibly think Amelia's conduct
exceptionable._


Booth and his wife being left alone, a solemn silence prevailed during
a few minutes. At last Amelia, who, though a good, was yet a human
creatures said to her husband, "Pray, my dear, do inform me what could
put you into so great a passion when Mrs. Ellison first offered me the
tickets for this masquerade?"

"I had rather you would not ask me," said Booth. "You have obliged me
greatly in your ready acquiescence with my desire, and you will add
greatly to the obligation by not enquiring the reason of it. This you
may depend upon, Amelia, that your good and happiness are the great
objects of all my wishes, and the end I propose in all my actions. This
view alone could tempt me to refuse you anything, or to conceal anything
from you."

"I will appeal to yourself," answered she, "whether this be not using
me too much like a child, and whether I can possibly help being a little
offended at it?"

"Not in the least," replied he; "I use you only with the tenderness of
a friend. I would only endeavour to conceal that from you which I think
would give you uneasiness if you knew. These are called the pious frauds
of friendship."

"I detest all fraud," says she; "and pious is too good an epithet to be
joined to so odious a word. You have often, you know, tried these frauds
with no better effect than to teize and torment me. You cannot imagine,
my dear, but that I must have a violent desire to know the reason of
words which I own I never expected to have heard. And the more you have
shown a reluctance to tell me, the more eagerly I have longed to know.
Nor can this be called a vain curiosity, since I seem so much interested
in this affair. If after all this, you still insist on keeping the
secret, I will convince you I am not ignorant of the duty of a wife by
my obedience; but I cannot help telling you at the same time you will
make me one of the most miserable of women."

"That is," cries he, "in other words, my dear Emily, to say, I will
be contented without the secret, but I am resolved to know it,
nevertheless."

"Nay, if you say so," cries she, "I am convinced you will tell me.
Positively, dear Billy, I must and will know."

"Why, then, positively," says Booth, "I will tell you. And I think I
shall then shew you that, however well you may know the duty of a wife,
I am not always able to behave like a husband. In a word then, my dear,
the secret is no more than this; I am unwilling you should receive any
more presents from my lord."

"Mercy upon me!" cries she, with all the marks of astonishment; "what! a
masquerade ticket!"--

"Yes, my dear," cries he; "that is, perhaps, the very worst and most
dangerous of all. Few men make presents of those tickets to ladies
without intending to meet them at the place. And what do we know of your
companion? To be sincere with you, I have not liked her behaviour for
some time. What might be the consequence of going with such a woman to
such a place, to meet such a person, I tremble to think. And now, my
dear, I have told you my reason of refusing her offer with some little
vehemence, and I think I need explain myself no farther."

"You need not, indeed, sir," answered she. "Good Heavens! did I ever
expect to hear this? I can appeal to heaven, nay, I will appeal to
yourself, Mr. Booth, if I have ever done anything to deserve such a
suspicion. If ever any action of mine, nay, if ever any thought, had
stained the innocence of my soul, I could be contented."

"How cruelly do you mistake me!" said Booth. "What suspicion have I ever
shewn?"

"Can you ask it," answered she, "after what you have just now declared?"

"If I have declared any suspicion of you," replied he, "or if ever I
entertained a thought leading that way, may the worst of evils that
ever afflicted human nature attend me! I know the pure innocence of that
tender bosom, I do know it, my lovely angel, and adore it. The snares
which might be laid for that innocence were alone the cause of my
apprehension. I feared what a wicked and voluptuous man, resolved to
sacrifice everything to the gratification of a sensual appetite with the
most delicious repast, might attempt. If ever I injured the unspotted
whiteness of thy virtue in my imagination, may hell---"

"Do not terrify me," cries she, interrupting him, "with such
imprecations. O, Mr. Booth! Mr. Booth! you must well know that a woman's
virtue is always her sufficient guard. No husband, without suspecting
that, can suspect any danger from those snares you mention; and why,
if you are liable to take such things into your head, may not your
suspicions fall on me as well as on any other? for sure nothing was ever
more unjust, I will not say ungrateful, than the suspicions which you
have bestowed on his lordship. I do solemnly declare, in all the times
I have seen the poor man, he hath never once offered the least
forwardness. His behaviour hath been polite indeed, but rather
remarkably distant than otherwise. Particularly when we played at cards
together. I don't remember he spoke ten words to me all the evening;
and when I was at his house, though he shewed the greatest fondness
imaginable to the children, he took so little notice of me, that a vain
woman would have been very little pleased with him. And if he gave them
many presents, he never offered me one. The first, indeed, which he ever
offered me was that which you in that kind manner forced me to refuse."

"All this may be only the effect of art," said Booth. "I am convinced
he doth, nay, I am convinced he must like you; and my good friend
James, who perfectly well knows the world, told me, that his lordship's
character was that of the most profuse in his pleasures with women;
nay, what said Mrs. James this very evening? 'His lordship is extremely
generous--where he likes.' I shall never forget the sneer with which she
spoke those last words."

"I am convinced they injure him," cries Amelia. "As for Mrs. James, she
was always given to be censorious; I remarked it in her long ago, as her
greatest fault. And for the colonel, I believe he may find faults enow
of this kind in his own bosom, without searching after them among his
neighbours. I am sure he hath the most impudent look of all the men I
know; and I solemnly declare, the very last time he was here he put me
out of countenance more than once."

"Colonel James," answered Booth, "may have his faults very probably. I
do not look upon him as a saint, nor do I believe he desires I should;
but what interest could he have in abusing this lord's character to me?
or why should I question his truth, when he assured me that my lord had
never done an act of beneficence in his life but for the sake of some
woman whom he lusted after?"

"Then I myself can confute him," replied Amelia: "for, besides his
services to you, which, for the future, I shall wish to forget, and his
kindness to my little babes, how inconsistent is the character which
James gives of him with his lordship's behaviour to his own nephew and
niece, whose extreme fondness of their uncle sufficiently proclaims his
goodness to them? I need not mention all that I have heard from Mrs.
Ellison, every word of which I believe; for I have great reason to
think, notwithstanding some little levity, which, to give her her due,
she sees and condemns in herself, she is a very good sort of woman."

"Well, my dear," cries Booth, "I may have been deceived, and I heartily
hope I am so; but in cases of this nature it is always good to be on the
surest side; for, as Congreve says,

              'The wise too jealous are: fools too secure.'"

Here Amelia burst into tears, upon which Booth immediately caught her in
his arms, and endeavoured to comfort her. Passion, however, for a while
obstructed her speech, and at last she cried, "O, Mr. Booth! can I bear
to hear the word jealousy from your mouth?"

"Why, my love," said Booth, "will you so fatally misunderstand my
meaning? how often shall I protest that it is not of you, but of him,
that I was jealous? If you could look into my breast, and there read all
the most secret thoughts of my heart, you would not see one faint idea
to your dishonour."

"I don't misunderstand you, my dear," said she, "so much as I am afraid
you misunderstand yourself. What is it you fear?--you mention not force,
but snares. Is not this to confess, at least, that you have some doubt
of my understanding? do you then really imagine me so weak as to be
cheated of my virtue?--am I to be deceived into an affection for a man
before I perceive the least inward hint of my danger? No, Mr. Booth,
believe me, a woman must be a fool indeed who can have in earnest such
an excuse for her actions. I have not, I think, any very high opinion
of my judgment, but so far I shall rely upon it, that no man breathing
could have any such designs as you have apprehended without my
immediately seeing them; and how I should then act I hope my whole
conduct to you hath sufficiently declared."

"Well, my dear," cries Booth, "I beg you will mention it no more; if
possible, forget it. I hope, nay, I believe, I have been in the wrong;
pray forgive me."

"I will, I do forgive you, my dear," said she, "if forgiveness be a
proper word for one whom you have rather made miserable than angry;
but let me entreat you to banish for ever all such suspicions from your
mind. I hope Mrs. Ellison hath not discovered the real cause of your
passion; but, poor woman, if she had, I am convinced it would go no
farther. Oh, Heavens! I would not for the world it should reach his
lordship's ears. You would lose the best friend that ever man had. Nay,
I would not for his own sake, poor man; for I really believe it would
affect him greatly, and I must, I cannot help having an esteem for so
much goodness. An esteem which, by this dear hand," said she, taking
Booth's hand and kissing it, "no man alive shall ever obtain by making
love to me."

Booth caught her in his arms and tenderly embraced her. After which the
reconciliation soon became complete; and Booth, in the contemplation of
his happiness, entirely buried all his jealous thoughts.




Chapter vii.

_A chapter in which there is much learning._


The next morning, whilst Booth was gone to take his morning walk, Amelia
went down into Mrs. Ellison's apartment, where, though she was received
with great civility, yet she found that lady was not at all pleased
with Mr. Booth; and, by some hints which dropt from her in conversation,
Amelia very greatly apprehended that Mrs. Ellison had too much suspicion
of her husband's real uneasiness; for that lady declared very openly she
could not help perceiving what sort of man Mr. Booth was: "And though I
have the greatest regard for you, madam, in the world," said she, "yet
I think myself in honour obliged not to impose on his lordship, who, I
know very well, hath conceived his greatest liking to the captain on my
telling him that he was the best husband in the world."

Amelia's fears gave her much disturbance, and when her husband returned
she acquainted him with them; upon which occasion, as it was natural,
she resumed a little the topic of their former discourse, nor could she
help casting, though in very gentle terms, some slight blame on Booth
for having entertained a suspicion which, she said, might in its
consequence very possibly prove their ruin, and occasion the loss of his
lordship's friendship.

Booth became highly affected with what his wife said, and the more, as
he had just received a note from Colonel James, informing him that the
colonel had heard of a vacant company in the regiment which Booth had
mentioned to him, and that he had been with his lordship about it, who
had promised to use his utmost interest to obtain him the command.

The poor man now exprest the utmost concern for his yesterday's
behaviour, said "he believed the devil had taken possession of him," and
concluded with crying out, "Sure I was born, my dearest creature, to be
your torment."

Amelia no sooner saw her husband's distress than she instantly forbore
whatever might seem likely to aggravate it, and applied herself, with
all her power, to comfort him. "If you will give me leave to offer my
advice, my dearest soul," said she, "I think all might yet be remedied.
I think you know me too well to suspect that the desire of diversion
should induce me to mention what I am now going to propose; and in that
confidence I will ask you to let me accept my lord's and Mrs. Ellison's
offer, and go to the masquerade. No matter how little while I stay
there; if you desire it I will not be an hour from you. I can make an
hundred excuses to come home, or tell a real truth, and say I am tired
with the place. The bare going will cure everything."

Amelia had no sooner done speaking than Booth immediately approved
her advice, and readily gave his consent. He could not, however, help
saying, that the shorter her stay was there, the more agreeable it would
be to him; "for you know, my dear," said he, "I would never willingly be
a moment out of your sight."

In the afternoon Amelia sent to invite Mrs. Ellison to a dish of tea;
and Booth undertook to laugh off all that had passed yesterday, in which
attempt the abundant good humour of that lady gave him great hopes of
success.

Mrs. Bennet came that afternoon to make a visit, and was almost an hour
with Booth and Amelia before the entry of Mrs. Ellison.

Mr. Booth had hitherto rather disliked this young lady, and had wondered
at the pleasure which Amelia declared she took in her company. This
afternoon, however, he changed his opinion, and liked her almost as much
as his wife had done. She did indeed behave at this time with more than
ordinary gaiety; and good humour gave a glow to her countenance that
set off her features, which were very pretty, to the best advantage, and
lessened the deadness that had usually appeared in her complexion.

But if Booth was now pleased with Mrs. Bennet, Amelia was still more
pleased with her than ever. For, when their discourse turned on love,
Amelia discovered that her new friend had all the same sentiments on
that subject with herself. In the course of their conversation Booth
gave Mrs. Bennet a hint of wishing her a good husband, upon which both
the ladies declaimed against second marriages with equal vehemence.

Upon this occasion Booth and his wife discovered a talent in their
visitant to which they had been before entirely strangers, and for which
they both greatly admired her, and this was, that the lady was a good
scholar, in which, indeed, she had the advantage of poor Amelia, whose
reading was confined to English plays and poetry; besides which, I think
she had conversed only with the divinity of the great and learned Dr
Barrow, and with the histories of the excellent Bishop Burnet.

Amelia delivered herself on the subject of second marriages with much
eloquence and great good sense; but when Mrs. Bennet came to give her
opinion she spoke in the following manner: "I shall not enter into the
question concerning the legality of bigamy. Our laws certainly allow
it, and so, I think, doth our religion. We are now debating only on the
decency of it, and in this light I own myself as strenuous an advocate
against it as any Roman matron would have been in those ages of the
commonwealth when it was held to be infamous. For my own part, how great
a paradox soever my opinion may seem, I solemnly declare, I see but
little difference between having two husbands at one time and at several
times; and of this I am very confident, that the same degree of love for
a first husband which preserves a woman in the one case will preserve
her in the other. There is one argument which I scarce know how to
deliver before you, sir; but--if a woman hath lived with her first
husband without having children, I think it unpardonable in her to carry
barrenness into a second family. On the contrary, if she hath children
by her first husband, to give them a second father is still more
unpardonable."

"But suppose, madam," cries Booth, interrupting her with a smile, "she
should have had children by her first husband, and have lost them?"

"That is a case," answered she, with a sigh, "which I did not desire to
think of, and I must own it the most favourable light in which a second
marriage can be seen. But the Scriptures, as Petrarch observes, rather
suffer them than commend them; and St Jerom speaks against them with the
utmost bitterness."--"I remember," cries Booth (who was willing either
to shew his learning, or to draw out the lady's), "a very wise law of
Charondas, the famous lawgiver of Thurium, by which men who married a
second time were removed from all public councils; for it was scarce
reasonable to suppose that he who was so great a fool in his own family
should be wise in public affairs. And though second marriages were
permitted among the Romans, yet they were at the same time discouraged,
and those Roman widows who refused them were held in high esteem, and
honoured with what Valerius Maximus calls the Corona Pudicitiae. In the
noble family of Camilli there was not, in many ages, a single instance
of this, which Martial calls adultery:

    _Quae toties nubit, non nubit; adultera lege est."_

"True, sir," says Mrs. Bennet, "and Virgil calls this a violation of
chastity, and makes Dido speak of it with the utmost detestation:

     _Sed mihi vel Tellus optem prius ima dehiscat
     Vel Pater omnipotens adigat me fulmine ad umbras,
     Pallentes umbras Erebi, noctemque profundam,
     Ante, fudor, quam te violo, aut tua jura resolvo.
     Ille meos, primum qui me sibi junxit, amores,
     Ille habeat semper secum, servetque Sepulchro."_

She repeated these lines with so strong an emphasis, that she almost
frightened Amelia out of her wits, and not a little staggered Booth, who
was himself no contemptible scholar. He expressed great admiration of
the lady's learning; upon which she said it was all the fortune given
her by her father, and all the dower left her by her husband; "and
sometimes," said she, "I am inclined to think I enjoy more pleasure from
it than if they had bestowed on me what the world would in general call
more valuable."--She then took occasion, from the surprize which Booth
had affected to conceive at her repeating Latin with so good a grace,
to comment on that great absurdity (for so she termed it) of excluding
women from learning; for which they were equally qualified with the men,
and in which so many had made so notable a proficiency; for a proof of
which she mentioned Madam Dacier, and many others.

Though both Booth and Amelia outwardly concurred with her sentiments, it
may be a question whether they did not assent rather out of complaisance
than from their real judgment.




Chapter viii.

_Containing some unaccountable behaviour in Mrs. Ellison._


Mrs. Ellison made her entrance at the end of the preceding discourse.
At her first appearance she put on an unusual degree of formality and
reserve; but when Amelia had acquainted her that she designed to accept
the favour intended her, she soon began to alter the gravity of her
muscles, and presently fell in with that ridicule which Booth thought
proper to throw on his yesterday's behaviour.

The conversation now became very lively and pleasant, in which Booth
having mentioned the discourse that passed in the last chapter, and
having greatly complimented Mrs. Bennet's speech on that occasion, Mrs.
Ellison, who was as strenuous an advocate on the other side, began to
rally that lady extremely, declaring it was a certain sign she intended
to marry again soon. "Married ladies," cries she, "I believe, sometimes
think themselves in earnest in such declarations, though they are
oftener perhaps meant as compliments to their husbands; but, when widows
exclaim loudly against second marriages, I would always lay a wager that
the man, if not the wedding-day, is absolutely fixed on."

Mrs. Bennet made very little answer to this sarcasm. Indeed, she had
scarce opened her lips from the time of Mrs. Ellison's coming into the
room, and had grown particularly grave at the mention of the masquerade.
Amelia imputed this to her being left out of the party, a matter which
is often no small mortification to human pride, and in a whisper asked
Mrs. Ellison if she could not procure a third ticket, to which she
received an absolute negative.

During the whole time of Mrs. Bennet's stay, which was above an
hour afterwards, she remained perfectly silent, and looked extremely
melancholy. This made Amelia very uneasy, as she concluded she had
guessed the cause of her vexation. In which opinion she was the more
confirmed from certain looks of no very pleasant kind which Mrs. Bennet
now and then cast on Mrs. Ellison, and the more than ordinary concern
that appeared in the former lady's countenance whenever the masquerade
was mentioned, and which; unfortunately, was the principal topic of
their discourse; for Mrs. Ellison gave a very elaborate description of
the extreme beauty of the place and elegance of the diversion.

When Mrs. Bennet was departed, Amelia could not help again soliciting
Mrs. Ellison for another ticket, declaring she was certain Mrs. Bennet
had a great inclination to go with them; but Mrs. Ellison again excused
herself from asking it of his lordship. "Besides, madam," says she, "if
I would go thither with Mrs. Bennet, which, I own to you, I don't chuse,
as she is a person whom _nobody knows_, I very much doubt whether she
herself would like it; for she is a woman of a very unaccountable turn.
All her delight lies in books; and as for public diversions, I have
heard her often declare her abhorrence of them."

"What then," said Amelia, "could occasion all that gravity from the
moment the masquerade was mentioned?"

"As to that," answered the other, "there is no guessing. You have seen
her altogether as grave before now. She hath had these fits of gravity
at times ever since the death of her husband."

"Poor creature!" cries Amelia; "I heartily pity her, for she must
certainly suffer a great deal on these occasions. I declare I have taken
a strange fancy to her."

"Perhaps you would not like her so well if you knew her thoroughly,"
answered Mrs. Ellison.--"She is, upon the whole, but of a whimsical
temper; and, if you will take my opinion, you should not cultivate too
much intimacy with her. I know you will never mention what I say; but
she is like some pictures, which please best at a distance."

Amelia did not seem to agree with these sentiments, and she greatly
importuned Mrs. Ellison to be more explicit, but to no purpose; she
continued to give only dark hints to Mrs. Bennet's disadvantage; and,
if ever she let drop something a little too harsh, she failed not
immediately to contradict herself by throwing some gentle commendations
into the other scale; so that her conduct appeared utterly unaccountable
to Amelia, and, upon the whole, she knew not whether to conclude Mrs.
Ellison to be a friend or enemy to Mrs. Bennet.

During this latter conversation Booth was not in the room, for he had
been summoned down-stairs by the serjeant, who came to him with news
from Murphy, whom he had met that evening, and who assured the serjeant
that, if he was desirous of recovering the debt which he had before
pretended to have on Booth, he might shortly have an opportunity, for
that there was to be a very strong petition to the reader may be pleased to remember, was a pretty good
master of the classics; for his father, though he designed his son for
the army, did not think it necessary to breed him up a blockhead. He did
not, perhaps, imagine that a competent share of Latin and Greek would
make his son either a pedant or a coward. He considered likewise,
probably, that the life of a soldier is in general a life of idleness;
and might think that the spare hours of an officer in country quarters
would be as well employed with a book as in sauntering about the
streets, loitering in a coffee-house, sotting in a tavern, or in laying
schemes to debauch and ruin a set of harmless ignorant country girls.

As Booth was therefore what might well be called, in this age at least,
a man of learning, he began to discourse our author on subjects of
literature. "I think, sir," says he, "that Dr Swift hath been generally
allowed, by the critics in this kingdom, to be the greatest master
of humour that ever wrote. Indeed, I allow him to have possessed most
admirable talents of this kind; and, if Rabelais was his master, I think
he proves the truth of the common Greek proverb--that the scholar is
often superior to the master. As to Cervantes, I do not think we can
make any just comparison; for, though Mr. Pope compliments him with
sometimes taking Cervantes' serious air--" "I remember the passage,"
cries the author;

     "O thou, whatever title please thine ear,
     Dean, Drapier, Bickerstaff, or Gulliver;
     Whether you take Cervantes' serious air,
     Or laugh and shake in Rabelais' easy chair--"

"You are right, sir," said Booth; "but though I should agree that
the doctor hath sometimes condescended to imitate Rabelais, I do not
remember to have seen in his works the least attempt in the manner of
Cervantes. But there is one in his own way, and whom I am convinced
he studied above all others--you guess, I believe, I am going to name
Lucian. This author, I say, I am convinced, he followed; but I think he
followed him at a distance: as, to say the truth, every other writer of
this kind hath done in my opinion; for none, I think, hath yet equalled
him. I agree, indeed, entirely with Mr. Moyle, in his Discourse on
the age of the Philopatris, when he gives him the epithet of the
incomparable Lucian; and incomparable, I believe, he will remain as long
as the language in which he wrote shall endure. What an inimitable piece
of humour is his Cock!" "I remember it very well," cries the author;
"his story of a Cock and a Bull is excellent." Booth stared at this, and
asked the author what he meant by the Bull? "Nay," answered he, "I don't
know very well, upon my soul. It is a long time since I read him. I
learnt him all over at school; I have not read him much since. And
pray, sir," said he, "how do you like his Pharsalia? don't you think Mr.
Rowe's translation a very fine one?" Booth replied, "I believe we are
talking of different authors. The Pharsalia, which Mr. Rowe translated,
was written by Lucan; but I have been speaking of Lucian, a Greek
writer, and, in my opinion, the greatest in the humorous way that ever
the world produced." "Ay!" cries the author, "he was indeed so, a very
excellent writer indeed! I fancy a translation of him would sell very
well!" "I do not know, indeed," cries Booth. "A good translation of him
would be a valuable book. I have seen a wretched one published by Mr.
Dryden, but translated by others, who in many places have misunderstood
Lucian's meaning, and have nowhere preserved the spirit of the
original." "That is great pity," says the author. "Pray, sir, is he well
translated in the French?" Booth answered, he could not tell; but that
he doubted it very much, having never seen a good version into that
language out of the Greek." To confess the truth, I believe," said he,
"the French translators have generally consulted the Latin only; which,
in some of the few Greek writers I have read, is intolerably bad. And
as the English translators, for the most part, pursue the French, we may
easily guess what spirit those copies of bad copies must preserve of the
original."

"Egad, you are a shrewd guesser," cries the author. "I am glad the
booksellers have not your sagacity. But how should it be otherwise,
considering the price they pay by the sheet? The Greek, you will allow,
is a hard language; and there are few gentlemen that write who can read
it without a good lexicon. Now, sir, if we were to afford time to find
out the true meaning of words, a gentleman would not get bread and
cheese by his work. If one was to be paid, indeed, as Mr. Pope was for
his Homer--Pray, sir, don't you think that the best translation in the
world?"

"Indeed, sir," cries Booth, "I think, though it is certainly a noble
paraphrase, and of itself a fine poem, yet in some places it is no
translation at all. In the very beginning, for instance, he hath not
rendered the true force of the author. Homer invokes his muse in the
five first lines of the Iliad; and, at the end of the fifth, he gives
his reason:

   [Greek]

For all these things," says he, "were brought about by the decree of
Jupiter; and, therefore, he supposes their true sources are known only
to the deities. Now, the translation takes no more notice of the [Greek]
than if no such word had been there."

"Very possibly," answered the author; "it is a long time since I read
the original. Perhaps, then, he followed the French translations. I
observe, indeed, he talks much in the notes of Madam Dacier and Monsieur
Eustathius."

Booth had now received conviction enough of his friend's knowledge of
the Greek language; without attempting, therefore, to set him right,
he made a sudden transition to the Latin. "Pray, sir," said he, "as you
have mentioned Rowe's translation of the Pharsalia, do you remember how
he hath rendered that passage in the character of Cato?--

    _----Venerisque huic maximus usus
        Progenies; urbi Pater est, urbique Maritus._

For I apprehend that passage is generally misunderstood."

"I really do not remember," answered the author. "Pray, sir, what do you
take to be the meaning?"

"I apprehend, sir," replied Booth, "that by these words, _Urbi Pater
est, urbique Maritus_, Cato is represented as the father and husband to
the city of Rome."

"Very true, sir," cries the author; "very fine, indeed.--Not only the
father of his country, but the husband too; very noble, truly!"

"Pardon me, sir," cries Booth; "I do not conceive that to have been
Lucan's meaning. If you please to observe the context; Lucan, having
commended the temperance of Cato in the instances of diet and cloaths,
proceeds to venereal pleasures; of which, says the poet, his principal
use was procreation: then he adds, _Urbi Pater est, urbique Maritus;_
that he became a father and a husband for the sake only of the city."

"Upon my word that's true," cries the author; "I did not think of it.
It is much finer than the other.--_Urbis Pater est_--what is the
other?--ay--_Urbis Maritus._--It is certainly as you say, sir."

Booth was by this pretty well satisfied of the author's profound
learning; however, he was willing to try him a little farther. He asked
him, therefore, what was his opinion of Lucan in general, and in what
class of writers he ranked him?

The author stared a little at this question; and, after some hesitation,
answered, "Certainly, sir, I think he is a fine writer and a very great
poet."

"I am very much of the same opinion," cries Booth; "but where do you
class him--next to what poet do you place him?"

"Let me see," cries the author; "where do I class him? next to whom do I
place him?--Ay!--why--why, pray, where do you yourself place him?"

"Why, surely," cries Booth, "if he is not to be placed in the first rank
with Homer, and Virgil, and Milton, I think clearly he is at the head of
the second, before either Statius or Silius Italicus--though I allow to
each of these their merits; but, perhaps, an epic poem was beyond the
genius of either. I own, I have often thought, if Statius had ventured
no farther than Ovid or Claudian, he would have succeeded better; for
his Sylvae are, in my opinion, much better than his Thebais."

"I believe I was of the same opinion formerly," said the author.

"And for what reason have you altered it?" cries Booth.

"I have not altered it," answered the author; "but, to tell you the
truth, I have not any opinion at all about these matters at present. I
do not trouble my head much with poetry; for there is no encouragement
to such studies in this age. It is true, indeed, I have now and then
wrote a poem or two for the magazines, but I never intend to write any
more; for a gentleman is not paid for his time. A sheet is a sheet with
the booksellers; and, whether it be in prose or verse, they make no
difference; though certainly there is as much difference to a gentleman
in the work as there is to a taylor between making a plain and a laced
suit. Rhimes are difficult things; they are stubborn things, sir. I have
been sometimes longer in tagging a couplet than I have been in writing
a speech on the side of the opposition which hath been read with great
applause all over the kingdom."

"I am glad you are pleased to confirm that," cries Booth; "for I
protest it was an entire secret to me till this day. I was so perfectly
ignorant, that I thought the speeches published in the magazines were
really made by the members themselves."

"Some of them, and I believe I may, without vanity, say the best," cries
the author, "are all the productions of my own pen! but I believe I
shall leave it off soon, unless a sheet of speech will fetch more than
it does at present. In truth, the romance-writing is the only branch of
our business now that is worth following. Goods of that sort have had so
much success lately in the market, that a bookseller scarce cares what
he bids for them. And it is certainly the easiest work in the world;
you may write it almost as fast as you can set pen to paper; and if
you interlard it with a little scandal, a little abuse on some living
characters of note, you cannot fail of success."

"Upon my word, sir," cries Booth, "you have greatly instructed me. I
could not have imagined there had been so much regularity in the trade
of writing as you are pleased to mention; by what I can perceive, the
pen and ink is likely to become the staple commodity of the kingdom."

"Alas! sir," answered the author, "it is overstocked. The market is
overstocked. There is no encouragement to merit, no patrons. I have been
these five years soliciting a subscription for my new translation of
Ovid's Metamorphoses, with notes explanatory, historical, and critical;
and I have scarce collected five hundred names yet."

The mention of this translation a little surprized Booth; not only
as the author had just declared his intentions to forsake the tuneful
muses; but, for some other reasons which he had collected from his
conversation with our author, he little expected to hear of a proposal
to translate any of the Latin poets. He proceeded, therefore, to
catechise him a little farther; and by his answers was fully satisfied
that he had the very same acquaintance with Ovid that he had appeared to
have with Lucan.

The author then pulled out a bundle of papers containing proposals for
his subscription, and receipts; and, addressing himself to Booth, said,
"Though the place in which we meet, sir, is an improper place to solicit
favours of this kind, yet, perhaps, it may be in your power to serve
me if you will charge your pockets with some of these." Booth was just
offering at an excuse, when the bailiff introduced Colonel James and the
serjeant.

The unexpected visit of a beloved friend to a man in affliction,
especially in Mr. Booth's situation, is a comfort which can scarce
be equalled; not barely from the hopes of relief or redress by his
assistance, but as it is an evidence of sincere friendship which scarce
admits of any doubt or suspicion. Such an instance doth indeed make a
man amends for all ordinary troubles and distresses; and we ought to
think ourselves gainers by having had such an opportunity of discovering
that we are possessed of one of the most valuable of all human
possessions.

Booth was so transported at the sight of the colonel, that he dropt the
proposals which the author had put into his hands, and burst forth into
the highest professions of gratitude to his friend; who behaved very
properly on his side, and said everything which became the mouth of a
friend on the occasion.

It is true, indeed, he seemed not moved equally either with Booth or the
serjeant, both whose eyes watered at the scene. In truth, the colonel,
though a very generous man, had not the least grain of tenderness in his
disposition. His mind was formed of those firm materials of which nature
formerly hammered out the Stoic, and upon which the sorrows of no man
living could make an impression. A man of this temper, who doth not much
value danger, will fight for the person he calls his friend, and the
man that hath but little value for his money will give it him; but such
friendship is never to be absolutely depended on; for, whenever the
favourite passion interposes with it, it is sure to subside and vanish
into air. Whereas the man whose tender disposition really feels the
miseries of another will endeavour to relieve them for his own sake;
and, in such a mind, friendship will often get the superiority over
every other passion.

But, from whatever motive it sprung, the colonel's behaviour to Booth
seemed truly amiable; and so it appeared to the author, who took the
first occasion to applaud it in a very florid oration; which the reader,
when he recollects that he was a speech-maker by profession, will not
be surprized at; nor, perhaps, will be much more surprized that he soon
after took an occasion of clapping a proposal into the colonel's hands,
holding at the same time a receipt very visible in his own.

The colonel received both, and gave the author a guinea in exchange,
which was double the sum mentioned in the receipt; for which the author
made a low bow, and very politely took his leave, saying, "I suppose,
gentlemen, you may have some private business together; I heartily
wish a speedy end to your confinement, and I congratulate you on the
possessing so great, so noble, and so generous a friend."




Chapter vi.

_Which inclines rather to satire than panegyric._


The colonel had the curiosity to ask Booth the name of the gentleman
who, in the vulgar language, had struck, or taken him in for a guinea
with so much ease and dexterity. Booth answered, he did not know his
name; all that he knew of him was, that he was the most impudent and
illiterate fellow he had ever seen, and that, by his own account, he was
the author of most of the wonderful productions of the age. "Perhaps,"
said he, "it may look uncharitable in me to blame you for your
generosity; but I am convinced the fellow hath not the least merit or
capacity, and you have subscribed to the most horrid trash that ever was
published."

"I care not a farthing what he publishes," cries the colonel. "Heaven
forbid I should be obliged to read half the nonsense I have subscribed
to."

"But don't you think," said Booth, "that by such indiscriminate
encouragement of authors you do a real mischief to the society? By
propagating the subscriptions of such fellows, people are tired out
and withhold their contributions to men of real merit; and, at the same
time, you are contributing to fill the world, not only with nonsense,
but with all the scurrility, indecency, and profaneness with which
the age abounds, and with which all bad writers supply the defect of
genius."

"Pugh!" cries the colonel, "I never consider these matters. Good or bad,
it is all one to me; but there's an acquaintance of mine, and a man of
great wit too, that thinks the worst the best, as they are the surest to
make him laugh."

"I ask pardon, sir," says the serjeant; "but I wish your honour would
consider your own affairs a little, for it grows late in the evening."

"The serjeant says true," answered the colonel. "What is it you intend
to do?"

"Faith, colonel, I know not what I shall do. My affairs seem so
irreparable, that I have been driving them as much as possibly I could
from my mind. If I was to suffer alone, I think I could bear them with
some philosophy; but when I consider who are to be the sharers in my
fortune--the dearest of children, and the best, the worthiest, and the
noblest of women---Pardon me, my dear friend, these sensations are above
me; they convert me into a woman; they drive me to despair, to madness."

The colonel advised him to command himself, and told him this was not
the way to retrieve his fortune. "As to me, my dear Booth," said he,
"you know you may command me as far as is really within my power."

Booth answered eagerly, that he was so far from expecting any more
favours from the colonel, that he had resolved not to let him know
anything of his misfortune. "No, my dear friend," cries he, "I am
too much obliged to you already;" and then burst into many fervent
expressions of gratitude, till the colonel himself stopt him, and begged
him to give an account of the debt or debts for which he was detained in
that horrid place.

Booth answered, he could not be very exact, but he feared it was upwards
of four hundred pounds.

"It is but three hundred pounds, indeed, sir," cries the serjeant; "if
you can raise three hundred pounds, you are a free man this moment."

Booth, who did not apprehend the generous meaning of the serjeant as
well as, I believe, the reader will, answered he was mistaken; that he
had computed his debts, and they amounted to upwards of four hundred
pounds; nay, that the bailiff had shewn him writs for above that sum.

"Whether your debts are three or four hundred," cries the colonel, "the
present business is to give bail only, and then you will have some time
to try your friends: I think you might get a company abroad, and then
I would advance the money on the security of half your pay; and, in the
mean time, I will be one of your bail with all my heart."

Whilst Booth poured forth his gratitude for all this kindness, the
serjeant ran down-stairs for the bailiff, and shortly after returned
with him into the room.

The bailiff, being informed that the colonel offered to be bail for his
prisoner, answered a little surlily, "Well, sir, and who will be the
other? you know, I suppose, there must be two; and I must have time to
enquire after them."

The colonel replied, "I believe, sir, I am well known to be responsible
for a much larger sum than your demand on this gentleman; but, if your
forms require two, I suppose the serjeant here will do for the other."

"I don't know the serjeant nor you either, sir," cries Bondum; "and,
if you propose yourselves bail for the gentleman, I must have time to
enquire after you."

"You need very little time to enquire after me," says the colonel, "for
I can send for several of the law, whom I suppose you know, to satisfy
you; but consider, it is very late."

"Yes, sir," answered Bondum, "I do consider it is too late for the
captain to be bailed to-night."

"What do you mean by too late?" cries the colonel.

"I mean, sir, that I must search the office, and that is now shut up;
for, if my lord mayor and the court of aldermen would be bound for him,
I would not discharge him till I had searched the office."

"How, sir!" cries the colonel, "hath the law of England no more regard
for the liberty of the subject than to suffer such fellows as you to
detain a man in custody for debt, when he can give undeniable security?"

"Don't fellow me," said the bailiff; "I am as good a fellow as yourself,
I believe, though you have that riband in your hat there."

"Do you know whom you are speaking to?" said the serjeant. "Do you know
you are talking to a colonel of the army?"

"What's a colonel of the army to me?" cries the bailiff. "I have had as
good as he in my custody before now."

"And a member of parliament?" cries the serjeant.

"Is the gentleman a member of parliament?--Well, and what harm have I
said? I am sure I meant no harm; and, if his honour is offended, I
ask his pardon; to be sure his honour must know that the sheriff is
answerable for all the writs in the office, though they were never so
many, and I am answerable to the sheriff. I am sure the captain can't
say that I have shewn him any manner of incivility since he hath been
here.--And I hope, honourable sir," cries he, turning to the colonel,
"you don't take anything amiss that I said, or meant by way of
disrespect, or any such matter. I did not, indeed, as the gentleman here
says, know who I was speaking to; but I did not say anything uncivil as
I know of, and I hope no offence."

The colonel was more easily pacified than might have been expected, and
told the bailiff that, if it was against the rules of law to discharge
Mr. Booth that evening, he must be contented. He then addressed himself
to his friend, and began to prescribe comfort and patience to him;
saying, he must rest satisfied with his confinement that night; and the
next morning he promised to visit him again.

Booth answered, that as for himself, the lying one night in any place
was very little worth his regard. "You and I, my dear friend, have both
spent our evening in a worse situation than I shall in this house. All
my concern is for my poor Amelia, whose sufferings on account of my
absence I know, and I feel with unspeakable tenderness. Could I be
assured she was tolerably easy, I could be contented in chains or in a
dungeon."

"Give yourself no concern on her account," said the colonel; "I will
wait on her myself, though I break an engagement for that purpose, and
will give her such assurances as I am convinced will make her perfectly
easy."

Booth embraced his friend, and, weeping over him, paid his
acknowledgment with tears for all his goodness. In words, indeed, he was
not able to thank him; for gratitude, joining with his other passions,
almost choaked him, and stopt his utterance.

After a short scene in which nothing past worth recounting, the colonel
bid his friend good night, and leaving the serjeant with him, made the
best of his way back to Amelia.




Chapter vii.

_Worthy a very serious perusal._


The colonel found Amelia sitting very disconsolate with Mrs. Atkinson.
He entered the room with an air of great gaiety, assured Amelia that
her husband was perfectly well, and that he hoped the next day he would
again be with her.

Amelia was a little comforted at this account, and vented many grateful
expressions to the colonel for his unparalleled friendship, as she was
pleased to call it. She could not, however, help giving way soon after
to a sigh at the thoughts of her husband's bondage, and declared that
night would be the longest she had ever known.

"This lady, madam," cries the colonel, "must endeavour to make it
shorter. And, if you will give me leave, I will join in the same
endeavour." Then, after some more consolatory speeches, the colonel
attempted to give a gay turn to the discourse, and said, "I was engaged
to have spent this evening disagreeably at Ranelagh, with a set of
company I did not like. How vastly am I obliged to you, dear Mrs. Booth,
that I pass it so infinitely more to my satisfaction!"

"Indeed, colonel," said Amelia, "I am convinced that to a mind so
rightly turned as yours there must be a much sweeter relish in the
highest offices of friendship than in any pleasures which the gayest
public places can afford."

"Upon my word, madam," said the colonel, "you now do me more than
justice. I have, and always had, the utmost indifference for such
pleasures. Indeed, I hardly allow them worthy of that name, or, if they
are so at all, it is in a very low degree. In my opinion the highest
friendship must always lead us to the highest pleasure."

Here Amelia entered into a long dissertation on friendship, in which she
pointed several times directly at the colonel as the hero of her tale.

The colonel highly applauded all her sentiments; and when he could
not avoid taking the compliment to himself, he received it with a most
respectful bow. He then tried his hand likewise at description, in which
he found means to repay all Amelia's panegyric in kind. This, though he
did with all possible delicacy, yet a curious observer might have been
apt to suspect that it was chiefly on her account that the colonel had
avoided the masquerade.

In discourses of this kind they passed the evening, till it was very
late, the colonel never offering to stir from his chair before the clock
had struck one; when he thought, perhaps, that decency obliged him to
take his leave.

As soon as he was gone Mrs. Atkinson said to Mrs. Booth, "I think,
madam, you told me this afternoon that the colonel was married?"

Amelia answered, she did so.

"I think likewise, madam," said Mrs. Atkinson, "you was acquainted with
the colonel's lady?"

Amelia answered that she had been extremely intimate with her abroad.

"Is she young and handsome?" said Mrs. Atkinson. "In short, pray, was it
a match of love or convenience?"

Amelia answered, entirely of love, she believed, on his side; for that
the lady had little or no fortune.

"I am very glad to hear it," said Mrs. Atkinson; "for I am sure the
colonel is in love with somebody. I think I never saw a more luscious
picture of love drawn than that which he was pleased to give us as the
portraiture of friendship. I have read, indeed, of Pylades and Orestes,
Damon and Pythias, and other great friends of old; nay, I sometimes
flatter myself that I am capable of being a friend myself; but as for
that fine, soft, tender, delicate passion, which he was pleased
to describe, I am convinced there must go a he and a she to the
composition."

"Upon my word, my dear, you are mistaken," cries Amelia. "If you had
known the friendship which hath always subsisted between the colonel
and my husband, you would not imagine it possible for any description
to exceed it. Nay, I think his behaviour this very day is sufficient to
convince you."

"I own what he hath done to-day hath great merit," said Mrs. Atkinson;
"and yet, from what he hath said to-night--You will pardon me, dear
madam; perhaps I am too quick-sighted in my observations; nay, I am
afraid I am even impertinent."

"Fie upon it!" cries Amelia; "how can you talk in that strain? Do you
imagine I expect ceremony? Pray speak what you think with the utmost
freedom."

"Did he not then," said Mrs. Atkinson, "repeat the words, _the
finest woman in the world_, more than once? did he not make use of an
expression which might have become the mouth of Oroondates himself? If
I remember, the words were these--that, had he been Alexander the Great,
he should have thought it more glory to have wiped off a tear from the
bright eyes of Statira than to have conquered fifty worlds."

"Did he say so?" cries Amelia--"I think he did say something like it;
but my thoughts were so full of my husband that I took little notice.
But what would you infer from what he said? I hope you don't think he is
in love with me?"

"I hope he doth not think so himself," answered Mrs. Atkinson; "though,
when he mentioned the bright eyes of Statira, he fixed his own eyes on
yours with the most languishing air I ever beheld."

Amelia was going to answer, when the serjeant arrived, and then she
immediately fell to enquiring after her husband, and received such
satisfactory answers to all her many questions concerning him, that
she expressed great pleasure. These ideas so possessed her mind, that,
without once casting her thoughts on any other matters, she took her
leave of the serjeant and his lady, and repaired to bed to her children,
in a room which Mrs. Atkinson had provided her in the same house; where
we will at present wish her a good night.




Chapter viii.

_Consisting of grave matters._


While innocence and chearful hope, in spite of the malice of fortune,
closed the eyes of the gentle Amelia on her homely bed, and she enjoyed
a sweet and profound sleep, the colonel lay restless all night on his
down; his mind was affected with a kind of ague fit; sometimes scorched
up with flaming desires, and again chilled with the coldest despair.

There is a time, I think, according to one of our poets, _when lust and
envy sleep_. This, I suppose, is when they are well gorged with the food
they most delight in; but, while either of these are hungry,

      Nor poppy, nor mandragora,
      Nor all the drousy syrups of the East,
      Will ever medicine them to slumber.

The colonel was at present unhappily tormented by both these fiends.
His last evening's conversation with Amelia had done his business
effectually. The many kind words she had spoken to him, the many
kind looks she had given him, as being, she conceived, the friend and
preserver of her husband, had made an entire conquest of his heart.
Thus the very love which she bore him, as the person to whom her little
family were to owe their preservation and happiness, inspired him with
thoughts of sinking them all in the lowest abyss of ruin and misery;
and, while she smiled with all her sweetness on the supposed friend of
her husband, she was converting that friend into his most bitter enemy.

      Friendship, take heed; if woman interfere,
      Be sure the hour of thy destruction's near.

These are the lines of Vanbrugh; and the sentiment is better than the
poetry. To say the truth, as a handsome wife is the cause and cement
of many false friendships, she is often too liable to destroy the real
ones.

Thus the object of the colonel's lust very plainly appears, but the
object of his envy may be more difficult to discover. Nature and Fortune
had seemed to strive with a kind of rivalship which should bestow
most on the colonel. The former had given him person, parts, and
constitution, in all which he was superior to almost every other man.
The latter had given him rank in life, and riches, both in a very
eminent degree. Whom then should this happy man envy? Here, lest
ambition should mislead the reader to search the palaces of the great,
we will direct him at once to Gray's-inn-lane; where, in a miserable
bed, in a miserable room, he will see a miserable broken lieutenant, in
a miserable condition, with several heavy debts on his back, and
without a penny in his pocket. This, and no other, was the object of
the colonel's envy. And why? because this wretch was possessed of the
affections of a poor little lamb, which all the vast flocks that
were within the power and reach of the colonel could not prevent that
glutton's longing for. And sure this image of the lamb is not improperly
adduced on this occasion; for what was the colonel's desire but to lead
this poor lamb, as it were, to the slaughter, in order to purchase a
feast of a few days by her final destruction, and to tear her away from
the arms of one where she was sure of being fondled and caressed all the
days of her life.

While the colonel was agitated with these thoughts, his greatest comfort
was, that Amelia and Booth were now separated; and his greatest terror
was of their coming again together. From wishes, therefore, he began to
meditate designs; and so far was he from any intention of procuring the
liberty of his friend, that he began to form schemes of prolonging his
confinement, till he could procure some means of sending him away far
from her; in which case he doubted not but of succeeding in all he
desired.

He was forming this plan in his mind when a servant informed him that
one serjeant Atkinson desired to speak with his honour. The serjeant was
immediately admitted, and acquainted the colonel that, if he pleased to
go and become bail for Mr. Booth, another unexceptionable housekeeper
would be there to join with him. This person the serjeant had procured
that morning, and had, by leave of his wife, given him a bond of
indemnification for the purpose.

The colonel did not seem so elated with this news as Atkinson expected.
On the contrary, instead of making a direct answer to what Atkinson
said, the colonel began thus: "I think, serjeant, Mr. Booth hath told me
that you was foster-brother to his lady. She is really a charming woman,
and it is a thousand pities she should ever have been placed in the
dreadful situation she is now in. There is nothing so silly as for
subaltern officers of the army to marry, unless where they meet with
women of very great fortunes indeed. What can be the event of their
marrying otherwise, but entailing misery and beggary on their wives and
their posterity?"

"Ah! sir," cries the serjeant, "it is too late to think of those matters
now. To be sure, my lady might have married one of the top gentlemen in
the country; for she is certainly one of the best as well as one of the
handsomest women in the kingdom; and, if she had been fairly dealt by,
would have had a very great fortune into the bargain. Indeed, she is
worthy of the greatest prince in the world; and, if I had been the
greatest prince in the world, I should have thought myself happy with
such a wife; but she was pleased to like the lieutenant, and certainly
there can be no happiness in marriage without liking."

"Lookee, serjeant," said the colonel; "you know very well that I am the
lieutenant's friend. I think I have shewn myself so."

"Indeed your honour hath," quoth the serjeant, "more than once to my
knowledge."

"But I am angry with him for his imprudence, greatly angry with him for
his imprudence; and the more so, as it affects a lady of so much worth."

"She is, indeed, a lady of the highest worth," cries the serjeant. "Poor
dear lady! I knew her, an 't please your honour, from her infancy;
and the sweetest-tempered, best-natured lady she is that ever trod on
English ground. I have always loved her as if she was my own sister.
Nay, she hath very often called me brother; and I have taken it to be a
greater honour than if I was to be called a general officer."

"What pity it is," said the colonel, "that this worthy creature should
be exposed to so much misery by the thoughtless behaviour of a man
who, though I am his friend, I cannot help saying, hath been guilty of
imprudence at least! Why could he not live upon his half-pay? What had
he to do to run himself into debt in this outrageous manner?"

"I wish, indeed," cries the serjeant, "he had been a little more
considerative; but I hope this will be a warning to him."

"How am I sure of that," answered the colonel; "or what reason is there
to expect it? extravagance is a vice of which men are not so easily
cured. I have thought a great deal of this matter, Mr. serjeant; and,
upon the most mature deliberation, I am of opinion that it will be
better, both for him and his poor lady, that he should smart a little
more."

"Your honour, sir, to be sure is in the right," replied the serjeant;
"but yet, sir, if you will pardon me for speaking, I hope you will be
pleased to consider my poor lady's case. She suffers, all this while,
as much or more than the lieutenant; for I know her so well, that I am
certain she will never have a moment's ease till her husband is out of
confinement."

"I know women better than you, serjeant," cries the colonel; "they
sometimes place their affections on a husband as children do on their
nurse; but they are both to be weaned. I know you, serjeant, to be a
fellow of sense as well as spirit, or I should not speak so freely to
you; but I took a fancy to you a long time ago, and I intend to serve
you; but first, I ask you this question--Is your attachment to Mr. Booth
or his lady?"

"Certainly, sir," said the serjeant, "I must love my lady best. Not but
I have a great affection for the lieutenant too, because I know my lady
hath the same; and, indeed, he hath been always very good to me as far
as was in his power. A lieutenant, your honour knows, can't do a great
deal; but I have always found him my friend upon all occasions."

"You say true," cries the colonel; "a lieutenant can do but little;
but I can do much to serve you, and will too. But let me ask you one
question: Who was the lady whom I saw last night with Mrs. Booth at her
lodgings?"

Here the serjeant blushed, and repeated, "The lady, sir?"

"Ay, a lady, a woman," cries the colonel, "who supped with us last
night. She looked rather too much like a gentlewoman for the mistress of
a lodging-house."

The serjeant's cheeks glowed at this compliment to his wife; and he was
just going to own her when the colonel proceeded: "I think I never saw
in my life so ill-looking, sly, demure a b---; I would give something,
methinks, to know who she was."

"I don't know, indeed," cries the serjeant, in great confusion; "I know
nothing about her."

"I wish you would enquire," said the colonel, "and let me know her name,
and likewise what she is: I have a strange curiosity to know, and let me
see you again this evening exactly at seven."

"And will not your honour then go to the lieutenant this morning?" said
Atkinson.

"It is not in my power," answered the colonel; "I am engaged another
way. Besides, there is no haste in this affair. If men will be imprudent
they must suffer the consequences. Come to me at seven, and bring me all
the particulars you can concerning that ill-looking jade I mentioned to
you, for I am resolved to know who she is. And so good-morrow to you,
serjeant; be assured I will take an opportunity to do something for
you."

Though some readers may, perhaps, think the serjeant not unworthy of
the freedom with which the colonel treated him; yet that haughty officer
would have been very backward to have condescended to such familiarity
with one of his rank had he not proposed some design from it. In truth,
he began to conceive hopes of making the serjeant instrumental to his
design on Amelia; in other words, to convert him into a pimp; an office
in which the colonel had been served by Atkinson's betters, and which,
as he knew it was in his power very well to reward him, he had no
apprehension that the serjeant would decline--an opinion which the
serjeant might have pardoned, though he had never given the least
grounds for it, since the colonel borrowed it from the knowledge of his
own heart. This dictated to him that he, from a bad motive, was capable
of desiring to debauch his friend's wife; and the same heart inspired
him to hope that another, from another bad motive, might be guilty of
the same breach of friendship in assisting him. Few men, I believe,
think better of others than of themselves; nor do they easily allow the
existence of any virtue of which they perceive no traces in their own
minds; for which reason I have observed, that it is extremely difficult
to persuade a rogue that you are an honest man; nor would you ever
succeed in the attempt by the strongest evidence, was it not for the
comfortable conclusion which the rogue draws, that he who proves himself
to be honest proves himself to be a fool at the same time.




Chapter ix.

_A curious chapter, from which a curious reader may draw sundry
observations._


The serjeant retired from the colonel in a very dejected state of mind:
in which, however, we must leave him awhile and return to Amelia; who,
as soon as she was up, had despatched Mrs. Atkinson to pay off her
former lodgings, and to bring off all cloaths and other moveables.

The trusty messenger returned without performing her errand, for Mrs.
Ellison had locked up all her rooms, and was gone out very early that
morning, and the servant knew not whither she was gone.

The two ladies now sat down to breakfast, together with Amelia's two
children; after which, Amelia declared she would take a coach and visit
her husband. To this motion Mrs. Atkinson soon agreed, and offered to be
her companion. To say truth, I think it was reasonable enough; and the
great abhorrence which Booth had of seeing his wife in a bailiff's house
was, perhaps, rather too nice and delicate.

When the ladies were both drest, and just going to send for their
vehicle, a great knocking was heard at the door, and presently Mrs.
James was ushered into the room.

This visit was disagreeable enough to Amelia, as it detained her from
the sight of her husband, for which she so eagerly longed. However,
as she had no doubt but that the visit would be reasonably short, she
resolved to receive the lady with all the complaisance in her power.

Mrs. James now behaved herself so very unlike the person that she lately
appeared, that it might have surprized any one who doth not know that
besides that of a fine lady, which is all mere art and mummery, every
such woman hath some real character at the bottom, in which, whenever
nature gets the better of her, she acts. Thus the finest ladies in the
world will sometimes love, and sometimes scratch, according to their
different natural dispositions, with great fury and violence, though
both of these are equally inconsistent with a fine lady's artificial
character.

Mrs. James then was at the bottom a very good-natured woman, and the
moment she heard of Amelia's misfortune was sincerely grieved at it.
She had acquiesced on the very first motion with the colonel's design
of inviting her to her house; and this morning at breakfast, when he had
acquainted her that Amelia made some difficulty in accepting the offer,
very readily undertook to go herself and persuade her friend to accept
the invitation.

She now pressed this matter with such earnestness, that Amelia, who was
not extremely versed in the art of denying, was hardly able to refuse
her importunity; nothing, indeed, but her affection to Mrs. Atkinson
could have prevailed on her to refuse; that point, however, she would
not give up, and Mrs. James, at last, was contented with a promise that,
as soon as their affairs were settled, Amelia, with her husband and
family, would make her a visit, and stay some time with her in the
country, whither she was soon to retire.

Having obtained this promise, Mrs. James, after many very friendly
professions, took her leave, and, stepping into her coach, reassumed the
fine lady, and drove away to join her company at an auction.

The moment she was gone Mrs. Atkinson, who had left the room upon the
approach of Mrs. James, returned into it, and was informed by Amelia of
all that had past.

"Pray, madam," said Mrs. Atkinson, "do this colonel and his lady live,
as it is called, well together?"

"If you mean to ask," cries Amelia, "whether they are a very fond
couple, I must answer that I believe they are not."

"I have been told," says Mrs. Atkinson, "that there have been instances
of women who have become bawds to their own husbands, and the husbands
pimps for them."

"Fie upon it!" cries Amelia. "I hope there are no such people. Indeed,
my dear, this is being a little too censorious."

"Call it what you please," answered Mrs. Atkinson; "it arises from my
love to you and my fears for your danger. You know the proverb of a
burnt child; and, if such a one hath any good-nature, it will dread the
fire on the account of others as well as on its own. And, if I may
speak my sentiments freely, I cannot think you will be in safety at this
colonel's house."

"I cannot but believe your apprehensions to be sincere," replied Amelia;
"and I must think myself obliged to you for them; but I am convinced you
are entirely in an error. I look on Colonel James as the most generous
and best of men. He was a friend, and an excellent friend too, to my
husband, long before I was acquainted with him, and he hath done him a
thousand good offices. What do you say of his behaviour yesterday?"

"I wish," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "that this behaviour to-day had been
equal. What I am now going to undertake is the most disagreeable office
of friendship, but it is a necessary one. I must tell you, therefore,
what past this morning between the colonel and Mr. Atkinson; for, though
it will hurt you, you ought, on many accounts, to know it." Here she
related the whole, which we have recorded in the preceding chapter, and
with which the serjeant had acquainted her while Mrs. James was paying
her visit to Amelia. And, as the serjeant had painted the matter rather
in stronger colours than the colonel, so Mrs. Atkinson again a little
improved on the serjeant. Neither of these good people, perhaps,
intended to aggravate any circumstance; but such is, I believe, the
unavoidable consequence of all reports. Mrs. Atkinson, indeed, may be
supposed not to see what related to James in the most favourable light,
as the serjeant, with more honesty than prudence, had suggested to his
wife that the colonel had not the kindest opinion of her, and had called
her a sly and demure---: it is true he omitted ill-looking b---;
two words which are, perhaps, superior to the patience of any Job in
petticoats that ever lived. He made amends, however, by substituting
some other phrases in their stead, not extremely agreeable to a female
ear.

It appeared to Amelia, from Mrs. Atkinson's relation, that the colonel
had grossly abused Booth to the serjeant, and had absolutely refused to
become his bail. Poor Amelia became a pale and motionless statue at
this account. At length she cried, "If this be true, I and mine are all,
indeed, undone. We have no comfort, no hope, no friend left. I cannot
disbelieve you. I know you would not deceive me. Why should you, indeed,
deceive me? But what can have caused this alteration since last night?
Did I say or do anything to offend him?"

"You said and did rather, I believe, a great deal too much to please
him," answered Mrs. Atkinson. "Besides, he is not in the least offended
with you. On the contrary, he said many kind things."

"What can my poor love have done?" said Amelia. "He hath not seen the
colonel since last night. Some villain hath set him against my husband;
he was once before suspicious of such a person. Some cruel monster hath
belied his innocence!"

"Pardon me, dear madam," said Mrs. Atkinson; "I believe the person who
hath injured the captain with this friend of his is one of the worthiest
and best of creatures--nay, do not be surprized; the person I mean is
even your fair self: sure you would not be so dull in any other case;
but in this, gratitude, humility, modesty, every virtue, shuts your
eyes.

    _Mortales hebetant visus,_

as Virgil says. What in the world can be more consistent than his
desire to have you at his own house and to keep your husband confined
in another? All that he said and all that he did yesterday, and, what is
more convincing to me than both, all that he looked last night, are very
consistent with both these designs."

"O Heavens!" cries Amelia, "you chill my blood with horror! the idea
freezes me to death; I cannot, must not, will not think it. Nothing but
conviction! Heaven forbid I should ever have more conviction! And did he
abuse my husband? what? did he abuse a poor, unhappy, distrest creature,
opprest, ruined, torn from his children, torn away from his wretched
wife; the honestest, worthiest, noblest, tenderest, fondest, best--"
Here she burst into an agony of grief, which exceeds the power of
description.

In this situation Mrs. Atkinson was doing her utmost to support her
when a most violent knocking was heard at the door, and immediately the
serjeant ran hastily into the room, bringing with him a cordial which
presently relieved Amelia. What this cordial was, we shall inform the
reader in due time. In the mean while he must suspend his curiosity; and
the gentlemen at White's may lay wagers whether it was Ward's pill or Dr
James's powder.

But before we close this chapter, and return back to the bailiff's
house, we must do our best to rescue the character of our heroine from
the dulness of apprehension, which several of our quick-sighted readers
may lay more heavily to her charge than was done by her friend Mrs.
Atkinson.

I must inform, therefore, all such readers, that it is not because
innocence is more blind than guilt that the former often overlooks and
tumbles into the pit which the latter foresees and avoids. The truth is,
that it is almost impossible guilt should miss the discovering of all
the snares in its way, as it is constantly prying closely into every
corner in order to lay snares for others. Whereas innocence, having
no such purpose, walks fearlessly and carelessly through life, and is
consequently liable to tread on the gins which cunning hath laid to
entrap it. To speak plainly and without allegory or figure, it is
not want of sense, but want of suspicion, by which innocence is often
betrayed. Again, we often admire at the folly of the dupe, when we
should transfer our whole surprize to the astonishing guilt of the
betrayer. In a word, many an innocent person hath owed his ruin to this
circumstance alone, that the degree of villany was such as must have
exceeded the faith of every man who was not himself a villain.




Chapter x.

_In which are many profound secrets of philosophy._


Booth, having had enough of the author's company the preceding day,
chose now another companion. Indeed the author was not very solicitous
of a second interview; for, as he could have no hope from Booth's
pocket, so he was not likely to receive much increase to his vanity
from Booth's conversation; for, low as this wretch was in virtue, sense,
learning, birth, and fortune, he was by no means low in his vanity. This
passion, indeed, was so high in him, and at the same time so blinded him
to his own demerits, that he hated every man who did not either flatter
him or give him money. In short, he claimed a strange kind of right,
either to cheat all his acquaintance of their praise or to pick their
pockets of their pence, in which latter case he himself repaid very
liberally with panegyric.

A very little specimen of such a fellow must have satisfied a man of Mr.
Booth's temper. He chose, therefore, now to associaLike me!" repeated she. "Do you think if this had been our
first acquaintance I should have wasted so much time with you as I have?
for your part, indeed, I believe a woman will get very little advantage
by her having been formerly intimate with you." "I do not know, madam,"
said Booth, "that I deserve that character any more than I know the
person that now gives it me." "And you have the assurance then," said
she, in her own voice, "to affect not to remember me?" "I think," cries
Booth, "I have heard that voice before; but, upon my soul, I do not
recollect it." "Do you recollect," said she, "no woman that you have
used with the highest barbarity--I will not say ingratitude?" "No,
upon my honour," answered Booth. "Mention not honour," said she, "thou
wretch! for, hardened as thou art, I could shew thee a face that, in
spite of thy consummate impudence, would confound thee with shame and
horrour. Dost thou not yet know me?" "I do, madam, indeed," answered
Booth, "and I confess that of all women in the world you have the most
reason for what you said."

Here a long dialogue ensued between the gentleman and the lady, whom,
I suppose, I need not mention to have been Miss Matthews; but, as it
consisted chiefly of violent upbraidings on her side, and excuses
on his, I despair of making it entertaining to the reader, and shall
therefore return to the colonel, who, having searched all the rooms with
the utmost diligence, without finding the woman he looked for, began to
suspect that he had before fixed on the right person, and that Amelia
had denied herself to him, being pleased with her paramour, whom he had
discovered to be the noble peer.

He resolved, therefore, as he could have no sport himself, to spoil that
of others; accordingly he found out Booth, and asked him again what was
become of both their wives; for that he had searched all over the rooms,
and could find neither of them.

Booth was now a little alarmed at this account, and, parting with Miss
Matthews, went along with the colonel in search of his wife. As for Miss
Matthews, he had at length pacified her with a promise to make her a
visit; which promise she extorted from him, swearing bitterly, in the
most solemn manner, unless he made it to her, she would expose both him
and herself at the masquerade.

As he knew the violence of the lady's passions, and to what heights they
were capable of rising, he was obliged to come in to these terms: for
he had, I am convinced, no fear upon earth equal to that of Amelia's
knowing what it was in the power of Miss Matthews to communicate to
her, and which to conceal from her, he had already undergone so much
uneasiness.

The colonel led Booth directly to the place where he had seen the peer
and Amelia (such he was now well convinced she was) sitting together.
Booth no sooner saw her than he said to the colonel, "Sure that is
my wife in conversation with that masque?" "I took her for your lady
myself," said the colonel; "but I found I was mistaken. Hark ye, that is
my Lord----, and I have seen that very lady with him all this night."

This conversation past at a little distance, and out of the hearing
of the supposed Amelia; when Booth, looking stedfastly at the lady,
declared with an oath that he was positive the colonel was in the right.
She then beckoned to him with her fan; upon which he went directly to
her, and she asked him to go home, which he very readily consented to.
The peer then walked off: the colonel went in pursuit of his wife, or of
some other woman; and Booth and his lady returned in two chairs to their
lodgings.




Chapter iii.

_Consequences of the masquerade, not uncommon nor surprizing_.


The lady, getting first out of her chair, ran hastily up into the
nursery to the children; for such was Amelia's constant method at her
return home, at whatever hour. Booth then walked into the dining-room,
where he had not been long before Amelia came down to him, and, with a
most chearful countenance, said, "My dear, I fancy we have neither of
us supped; shall I go down and see whether there is any cold meat in the
house?"

"For yourself, if you please," answered Booth; "but I shall eat
nothing."

"How, my dear!" said Amelia; "I hope you have not lost your appetite at
the masquerade!" for supper was a meal at which he generally eat very
heartily.

"I know not well what I have lost," said Booth; "I find myself
disordered.--My head aches. I know not what is the matter with me."

"Indeed, my dear, you frighten me," said Amelia; "you look, indeed,
disordered. I wish the masquerade had been far enough before you had
gone thither."

"Would to Heaven it had!" cries Booth; "but that is over now. But pray,
Amelia, answer me one question--Who was that gentleman with you when I
came up to you?"

"The gentleman! my dear," said Amelia; "what gentleman?"

"The gentleman--the nobleman--when I came up; sure I speak plain."

"Upon my word, my dear, I don't understand you," answered she; "I did
not know one person at the masquerade."

"How!" said he; "what! spend the whole evening with a masque without
knowing him?"

"Why, my dear," said she, "you know we were not together."

"I know we were not," said he, "but what is that to the purpose? Sure
you answer me strangely. I know we were not together; and therefore I
ask you whom you were with?"

"Nay, but, my dear," said she, "can I tell people in masques?"

"I say again, madam," said he, "would you converse two hours or more
with a masque whom you did not know?"

"Indeed, child," says she, "I know nothing of the methods of a
masquerade; for I never was at one in my life."

"I wish to Heaven you had not been at this!" cries Booth. "Nay, you will
wish so yourself if you tell me truth.--What have I said? do I--can I
suspect you of not speaking truth? Since you are ignorant then I will
inform you: the man you have conversed with was no other than Lord----."

"And is that the reason," said she, "you wish I had not been there?"

"And is not that reason," answered he, "sufficient? Is he not the last
man upon earth with whom I would have you converse?"

"So you really wish then that I had not been at the masquerade?"

"I do," cried he, "from my soul."

"So may I ever be able," cried she, "to indulge you in every wish as in
this.--I was not there."

"Do not trifle, Amelia," cried he; "you would not jest with me if you
knew the situation of my mind."

"Indeed I do not jest with you," said she. "Upon my honour I was not
there. Forgive me this first deceit I ever practised, and indeed it
shall be the last; for I have paid severely for this by the uneasiness
it hath given me." She then revealed to him the whole secret, which was
thus:

I think it hath been already mentioned in some part of this history that
Amelia and Mrs. Atkinson were exactly of the same make and stature, and
that there was likewise a very near resemblance between their voices.
When Mrs. Atkinson, therefore, found that Amelia was so extremely averse
to the masquerade, she proposed to go thither in her stead, and to pass
upon Booth for his own wife.

This was afterwards very easily executed; for, when they left Booth's
lodgings, Amelia, who went last to her chair, ran back to fetch her
masque, as she pretended, which she had purposely left behind. She then
whipt off her domino, and threw it over Mrs. Atkinson, who stood ready
to receive it, and ran immediately downstairs, and, stepping into
Amelia's chair, proceeded with the rest to the masquerade.

As her stature exactly suited that of Amelia, she had very little
difficulty to carry on the imposition; for, besides the natural
resemblance of their voices, and the opportunity of speaking in a
feigned one, she had scarce an intercourse of six words with Booth
during the whole time; for the moment they got into the croud she took
the first opportunity of slipping from him. And he, as the reader may
remember, being seized by other women, and concluding his wife to be
safe with Mrs. James, was very well satisfied, till the colonel set him
upon the search, as we have seen before.

Mrs. Atkinson, the moment she came home, ran upstairs to the nursery,
where she found Amelia, and told her in haste that she might very easily
carry on the deceit with her husband; for that she might tell him what
she pleased to invent, as they had not been a minute together during the
whole evening.

Booth was no sooner satisfied that his wife had not been from home that
evening than he fell into raptures with her, gave her a thousand tender
caresses, blamed his own judgment, acknowledged the goodness of hers,
and vowed never to oppose her will more in any one instance during his
life.

Mrs. Atkinson, who was still in the nursery with her masquerade dress,
was then summoned down-stairs, and, when Booth saw her and heard her
speak in her mimic tone, he declared he was not surprized at his having
been imposed upon, for that, if they were both in the same disguise, he
should scarce be able to discover the difference between them.

They then sat down to half an hour's chearful conversation, after which
they retired all in the most perfect good humour.




Chapter iv.

_Consequences of the masquerade_.


When Booth rose in the morning he found in his pocket that letter which
had been delivered to him by Colonel Bath, which, had not chance brought
to his remembrance, he might possibly have never recollected.

He had now, however, the curiosity to open the letter, and beginning to
read it, the matter of it drew him on till he perused the whole; for,
notwithstanding the contempt cast upon it by those learned critics the
bucks, neither the subject nor the manner in which it was treated was
altogether contemptible.

But there was still another motive which induced Booth to read the whole
letter, and this was, that he presently thought he knew the hand. He
did, indeed, immediately conclude it was Dr Harrison; for the doctor
wrote a very remarkable one, and this letter contained all the
particularities of the doctor's character.

He had just finished a second reading of this letter when the doctor
himself entered the room. The good man was impatient to know the success
of Amelia's stratagem, for he bore towards her all that love which
esteem can create in a good mind, without the assistance of those
selfish considerations from which the love of wives and children may
be ordinarily deduced. The latter of which, Nature, by very subtle and
refined reasoning, suggests to us to be part of our dear selves; and
the former, as long as they remain the objects of our liking, that same
Nature is furnished with very plain and fertile arguments to recommend
to our affections. But to raise that affection in the human breast which
the doctor had for Amelia, Nature is forced to use a kind of logic which
is no more understood by a bad man than Sir Isaac Newton's doctrine of
colours is by one born blind. And yet in reality it contains nothing
more abstruse than this, that an injury is the object of anger, danger
of fear, and praise of vanity; for in the same simple manner it may be
asserted that goodness is the object of love.

The doctor enquired immediately for his child (for so he often called
Amelia); Booth answered that he had left her asleep, for that she
had had but a restless night. "I hope she is not disordered by the
masquerade," cries the doctor. Booth answered he believed she would be
very well when she waked. "I fancy," said he, "her gentle spirits were a
little too much fluttered last night; that is all."

"I hope, then," said the doctor, "you will never more insist on her
going to such places, but know your own happiness in having a wife that
hath the discretion to avoid those places; which, though perhaps they
may not be as some represent them, such brothels of vice and debauchery
as would impeach the character of every virtuous woman who was seen
at them, are certainly, however, scenes of riot, disorder, and
intemperance, very improper to be frequented by a chaste and sober
Christian matron."

Booth declared that he was very sensible of his error, and that, so far
from soliciting his wife to go to another masquerade, he did not intend
ever to go thither any more himself.

The doctor highly approved the resolution; and then Booth said, "And I
thank you, my dear friend, as well as my wife's discretion, that she
was not at the masquerade last night." He then related to the doctor
the discovery of the plot; and the good man was greatly pleased with the
success of the stratagem, and that Booth took it in such good part.

"But, sir," says Booth, "I had a letter given me by a noble colonel
there, which is written in a hand so very like yours, that I could
almost swear to it. Nor is the stile, as far as I can guess, unlike your
own. Here it is, sir. Do you own the letter, doctor, or do you not?"

The doctor took the letter, and, having looked at it a moment, said,
"And did the colonel himself give you this letter?"

"The colonel himself," answered Booth.

"Why then," cries the doctor, "he is surely the most impudent fellow
that the world ever produced. What! did he deliver it with an air of
triumph?"

"He delivered it me with air enough," cries Booth, "after his own
manner, and bid me read it for my edification. To say the truth, I am a
little surprized that he should single me out of all mankind to deliver
the letter to; I do not think I deserve the character of such a husband.
It is well I am not so very forward to take an affront as some folks."

"I am glad to see you are not," said the doctor; "and your behaviour
in this affair becomes both the man of sense and the Christian; for it
would be surely the greatest folly, as well as the most daring impiety,
to risque your own life for the impertinence of a fool. As long as
you are assured of the virtue of your own wife, it is wisdom in you
to despise the efforts of such a wretch. Not, indeed, that your wife
accuses him of any downright attack, though she hath observed enough in
his behaviour to give offence to her delicacy."

"You astonish me, doctor," said Booth. "What can you mean? my wife
dislike his behaviour! hath the colonel ever offended her?"

"I do not say he hath ever offended her by any open declarations; nor
hath he done anything which, according to the most romantic notion of
honour, you can or ought to resent; but there is something extremely
nice in the chastity of a truly virtuous woman."

"And hath my wife really complained of anything of that kind in the
colonel?"

"Look ye, young gentleman," cries the doctor; "I will have no
quarrelling or challenging; I find I have made some mistake, and
therefore I insist upon it by all the rights of friendship, that you
give me your word of honour you will not quarrel with the colonel on
this account."

"I do, with all my heart," said Booth; "for, if I did not know your
character, I should absolutely think you was jesting with me. I do not
think you have mistaken my wife, but I am sure she hath mistaken the
colonel, and hath misconstrued some over-strained point of gallantry,
something of the Quixote kind, into a design against her chastity; but
I have that opinion of the colonel, that I hope you will not be offended
when I declare I know not which of you two I should be the sooner
jealous of."

"I would by no means have you jealous of any one," cries the doctor;
"for I think my child's virtue may be firmly relied on; but I am
convinced she would not have said what she did to me without a cause;
nor should I, without such a conviction, have written that letter to
the colonel, as I own to you I did. However, nothing I say hath yet
past which, even in the opinion of false honour, you are at liberty
to resent! but as to declining any great intimacy, if you will take my
advice, I think that would be prudent."

"You will pardon me, my dearest friend," said Booth, "but I have really
such an opinion of the colonel that I would pawn my life upon his
honour; and as for women, I do not believe he ever had an attachment to
any."

"Be it so," said the doctor: "I have only two things to insist on. The
first is, that, if ever you change your opinion, this letter may not be
the subject of any quarrelling or fighting: the other is, that you never
mention a word of this to your wife. By the latter I shall see whether
you can keep a secret; and, if it is no otherwise material, it will be
a wholesome exercise to your mind; for the practice of any virtue is a
kind of mental exercise, and serves to maintain the health and vigour of
the soul."

"I faithfully promise both," cries Booth. And now the breakfast entered
the room, as did soon after Amelia and Mrs. Atkinson.

The conversation ran chiefly on the masquerade; and Mrs. Atkinson gave
an account of several adventures there; but whether she told the whole
truth with regard to herself I will not determine, for, certain it is,
she never once mentioned the name of the noble peer. Amongst the rest,
she said there was a young fellow that had preached a sermon there upon
a stool, in praise of adultery, she believed; for she could not get near
enough to hear the particulars.

During that transaction Booth had been engaged with the blue domino in
another room, so that he knew nothing of it; so that what Mrs. Atkinson
had now said only brought to his mind the doctor's letter to Colonel
Bath, for to him he supposed it was written; and the idea of the colonel
being a lover to Amelia struck him in so ridiculous a light, that it
threw him into a violent fit of laughter.

The doctor, who, from the natural jealousy of an author, imputed
the agitation of Booth's muscles to his own sermon or letter on that
subject, was a little offended, and said gravely, "I should be glad to
know the reason of this immoderate mirth. Is adultery a matter of jest
in your opinion?"

"Far otherwise," answered Booth. "But how is it possible to refrain from
laughter at the idea of a fellow preaching a sermon in favour of it at
such a place?"

"I am very sorry," cries the doctor, "to find the age is grown to so
scandalous a degree of licentiousness, that we have thrown off not only
virtue, but decency. How abandoned must be the manners of any nation
where such insults upon religion and morality can be committed with
impunity! No man is fonder of true wit and humour than myself; but to
profane sacred things with jest and scoffing is a sure sign of a weak
and a wicked mind. It is the very vice which Homer attacks in the odious
character of Thersites. The ladies must excuse my repeating the passage
to you, as I know you have Greek enough to understand it:--

    Os rh' epea phresin esin akosma te, polla te ede
    Maps, atar ou kata kosmon epizemenai basileusin,
    All'o, ti oi eisaito geloiton Argeiosin
    Emmenai

[Footnote: Thus paraphrased by Mr. Pope:

    "Awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,
     In scandal busy, in reproaches bold,
     With witty malice, studious to defame,
     Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim."]

And immediately adds,

    ----aiskistos de aner ypo Ilion elthe

[Footnote: "He was the greatest scoundrel in the whole army."]

"Horace, again, describes such a rascal:

                              ----Solutos
      Qui captat risus hominum famamque dicacis,

[Footnote: "Who trivial bursts of laughter strives to raise, And courts
of prating petulance the praise."--FRANCIS.]

 and says of him,

     Hic niger est, hunc tu, Romane, caveto."

[Footnote: "This man is black; do thou, O Roman! shun this man."]

"O charming Homer!" said Mrs. Atkinson, "how much above all other
writers!"

"I ask your pardon, madam," said the doctor; "I forgot you was a
scholar; but, indeed, I did not know you understood Greek as well as
Latin."

"I do not pretend," said she, "to be a critic in the Greek; but I think
I am able to read a little of Homer, at least with the help of looking
now and then into the Latin."

"Pray, madam," said the doctor, "how do you like this passage in the
speech of Hector to Andromache:

     ----Eis oikon iousa ta sautes erga komize,
     Iston t elakaten te, kai amphipoloisi keleue
     Ergon epoichesthai?

[Footnote: "Go home and mind your own business. Follow your spinning,
and keep your maids to their work."]

"Or how do you like the character of Hippodamia, who, by being the
prettiest girl and best workwoman of her age, got one of the best
husbands in all Troy?--I think, indeed, Homer enumerates her discretion
with her other qualifications; but I do not remember he gives us one
character of a woman of learning.--Don't you conceive this to be a great
omission in that who, by being the prettiest girl and best workwoman of
her age, got one of the best husbands in all Troy?---I think, indeed,
Homer enumerates her discretion with her other qualifications; but I
do not remember Don't you conceive this to be a great omission in that
charming poet? However, Juvenal makes you amends, for he talks very
abundantly of the learning of the Roman ladies in his time."

"You are a provoking man, doctor," said Mrs. Atkinson; "where is the
harm in a woman's having learning as well as a man?"

"Let me ask you another question," said the doctor. "Where is the harm
in a man's being a fine performer with a needle as well as a woman? And
yet, answer me honestly; would you greatly chuse to marry a man with a
thimble upon his finger? Would you in earnest think a needle became the
hand of your husband as well as a halberd?"

"As to war, I am with you," said she. "Homer himself, I well remember,
makes Hector tell his wife that warlike works--what is the Greek
word--Pollemy--something--belonged to men only; and I readily agree to
it. I hate a masculine woman, an Amazon, as much as you can do; but what
is there masculine in learning?"

"Nothing so masculine, take my word for it. As for your Pollemy, I look
upon it to be the true characteristic of a devil. So Homer everywhere
characterizes Mars."

"Indeed, my dear," cries the serjeant, "you had better not dispute with
the doctor; for, upon my word, he will be too hard for you."

"Nay, I beg _you_ will not interfere," cries Mrs. Atkinson; "I am sure
_you_ can be no judge in these matters."

At which the doctor and Booth burst into a loud laugh; and Amelia,
though fearful of giving her friend offence, could not forbear a gentle
smile.

"You may laugh, gentlemen, if you please," said Mrs. Atkinson; "but
I thank Heaven I have married a man who is not jealous of my
understanding. I should have been the most miserable woman upon earth
with a starched pedant who was possessed of that nonsensical opinion
that the difference of sexes causes any difference in the mind. Why
don't you honestly avow the Turkish notion that women have no souls? for
you say the same thing in effect."

"Indeed, my dear," cries the serjeant, greatly concerned to see his wife
so angry, "you have mistaken the doctor."

"I beg, my dear," cried she, "_you_ will say nothing upon these
subjects--I hope _you_ at least do not despise my understanding."

"I assure you, I do not," said the serjeant; "and I hope you will never
despise mine; for a man may have some understanding, I hope, without
learning."

Mrs. Atkinson reddened extremely at these words; and the doctor, fearing
he had gone too far, began to soften matters, in which Amelia assisted
him. By these means, the storm rising in Mrs. Atkinson before was in
some measure laid, at least suspended from bursting at present; but
it fell afterwards upon the poor serjeant's head in a torrent, who had
learned perhaps one maxim from his trade, that a cannon-ball always doth
mischief in proportion to the resistance it meets with, and that nothing
so effectually deadens its force as a woolpack. The serjeant therefore
bore all with patience; and the idea of a woolpack, perhaps, bringing
that of a feather-bed into his head, he at last not only quieted his
wife, but she cried out with great sincerity, "Well, my dear, I will
say one thing for you, that I believe from my soul, though you have no
learning, you have the best understanding of any man upon earth; and I
must own I think the latter far the more profitable of the two."

Far different was the idea she entertained of the doctor, whom, from
this day, she considered as a conceited pedant; nor could all Amelia's
endeavours ever alter her sentiments.

The doctor now took his leave of Booth and his wife for a week, he
intending to set out within an hour or two with his old friend, with
whom our readers were a little acquainted at the latter end of the
ninth book, and of whom, perhaps, they did not then conceive the most
favourable opinion.

Nay, I am aware that the esteem which some readers before had for the
doctor may be here lessened; since he may appear to have been too easy
a dupe to the gross flattery of the old gentleman. If there be any such
critics, we are heartily sorry, as well for them as for the doctor; but
it is our business to discharge the part of a faithful historian, and to
describe human nature as it is, not as we would wish it to be.




Chapter v.

_In which Colonel Bath appears in great glory_.


That afternoon, as Booth was walking in the Park, he met with Colonel
Bath, who presently asked him for the letter which he had given him the
night before; upon which Booth immediately returned it.

"Don't you think," cries Bath, "it is writ with great dignity of
expression and emphasis of--of--of judgment?"

"I am surprized, though," cries Booth, "that any one should write such a
letter to you, colonel."

"To me!" said Bath. "What do you mean, sir? I hope you don't imagine
any man durst write such a letter to me? d--n me, if I knew a man who
thought me capable of debauching my friend's wife, I would--d--n me."

"I believe, indeed, sir," cries Booth, "that no man living dares put his
name to such a letter; but you see it is anonymous."

"I don't know what you mean by ominous," cries the colonel; "but, blast
my reputation, if I had received such a letter, if I would not have
searched the world to have found the writer. D--n me, I would have gone
to the East Indies to have pulled off his nose."

"He would, indeed, have deserved it," cries Booth. "But pray, sir, how
came you by it?"

"I took it," said the colonel, "from a sett of idle young rascals,
one of whom was reading it out aloud upon a stool, while the rest were
attempting to make a jest, not only of the letter, but of all decency,
virtue, and religion. A sett of fellows that you must have seen or
heard of about the town, that are, d--n me, a disgrace to the dignity
of manhood; puppies that mistake noise and impudence, rudeness and
profaneness, for wit. If the drummers of my company had not more
understanding than twenty such fellows, I'd have them both whipt out of
the regiment."

"So, then, you do not know the person to whom it was writ?" said Booth.

"Lieutenant," cries the colonel, "your question deserves no answer.
I ought to take time to consider whether I ought not to resent the
supposition. Do you think, sir, I am acquainted with a rascal?"

"I do not suppose, colonel," cries Booth, "that you would willingly
cultivate an intimacy with such a person; but a man must have good luck
who hath any acquaintance if there are not some rascals among them."

"I am not offended with you, child," says the colonel. "I know you did
not intend to offend me."

"No man, I believe, dares intend it," said Booth.

"I believe so too," said the colonel; "d--n me, I know it. But you
know, child, how tender I am on this subject. If I had been ever married
myself, I should have cleft the man's skull who had dared look wantonly
at my wife."

"It is certainly the most cruel of all injuries," said Booth. "How
finely doth Shakespeare express it in his Othello!

    'But there, where I had treasured up my soul.'"

"That Shakespeare," cries the colonel, "was a fine fellow. He was a very
pretty poet indeed. Was it not Shakespeare that wrote the play about
Hotspur? You must remember these lines. I got them almost by heart at
the playhouse; for I never missed that play whenever it was acted, if I
was in town:--

     By Heav'n it was an easy leap,
     To pluck bright honour into the full moon,
     Or drive into the bottomless deep.

And--and--faith, I have almost forgot them; but I know it is something
about saving your honour from drowning--O! it is very fine! I say, d--n
me, the man that writ those lines was the greatest poet the world ever
produced. There is dignity of expression and emphasis of thinking, d--n
me."

Booth assented to the colonel's criticism, and then cried, "I wish,
colonel, you would be so kind to give me that letter." The colonel
answered, if he had any particular use for it he would give it him with
all his heart, and presently delivered it; and soon afterwards they
parted.

Several passages now struck all at once upon Booth's mind, which gave
him great uneasiness. He became confident now that he had mistaken one
colonel for another; and, though he could not account for the letter's
getting into those hands from whom Bath had taken it (indeed James had
dropt it out of his pocket), yet a thousand circumstances left him no
room to doubt the identity of the person, who was a man much more liable
to raise the suspicion of a husband than honest Bath, who would at any
time have rather fought with a man than lain with a woman.

The whole behaviour of Amelia now rushed upon his memory. Her resolution
not to take up her residence at the colonel's house, her backwardness
even to dine there, her unwillingness to go to the masquerade, many of
her unguarded expressions, and some where she had been more guarded, all
joined together to raise such an idea in Mr. Booth, that he had almost
taken a resolution to go and cut the colonel to pieces in his own
house. Cooler thoughts, however, suggested themselves to him in time.
He recollected the promise he had so solemnly made to the doctor. He
considered, moreover, that he was yet in the dark as to the extent of
the colonel's guilt. Having nothing, therefore, to fear from it,
he contented himself to postpone a resentment which he nevertheless
resolved to take of the colonel hereafter, if he found he was in any
degree a delinquent.

The first step he determined to take was, on the first opportunity, to
relate to Colonel James the means by which he became possessed of the
letter, and to read it to him; on which occasion, he thought he should
easily discern by the behaviour of the colonel whether he had been
suspected either by Amelia or the doctor without a cause; but as for
his wife, he fully resolved not to reveal the secret to her till the
doctor's return.

While Booth was deeply engaged by himself in these meditations, Captain
Trent came up to him, and familiarly slapped him on the shoulder.

They were soon joined by a third gentleman, and presently afterwards by
a fourth, both acquaintances of Mr. Trent; and all having walked twice
the length of the Mall together, it being now past nine in the evening,
Trent proposed going to the tavern, to which the strangers immediately
consented; and Booth himself, after some resistance, was at length
persuaded to comply.

To the King's Arms then they went, where the bottle went very briskly
round till after eleven; at which time Trent proposed a game at cards,
to which proposal likewise Booth's consent was obtained, though not
without much difficulty; for, though he had naturally some inclination
to gaming, and had formerly a little indulged it, yet he had entirely
left it off for many years.

Booth and his friend were partners, and had at first some success;
but Fortune, according to her usual conduct, soon shifted about, and
persecuted Booth with such malice, that in about two hours he was
stripped of all the gold in his pocket, which amounted to twelve
guineas, being more than half the cash which he was at that time worth.

How easy it is for a man who is at all tainted with the itch of gaming
to leave off play in such a situation, especially when he is likewise
heated with liquor, I leave to the gamester to determine. Certain it is
that Booth had no inclination to desist; but, on the contrary, was so
eagerly bent on playing on, that he called his friend out of the room,
and asked him for ten pieces, which he promised punctually to pay the
next morning.

Trent chid him for using so much formality on the occasion. "You know,"
said he, "dear Booth, you may have what money you please of me. Here
is a twenty-pound note at your service; and, if you want five times the
sum, it is at your service. We will never let these fellows go away with
our money in this manner; for we have so much the advantage, that if the
knowing ones were here they would lay odds of our side."

But if this was really Mr. Rent's opinion, he was very much mistaken;
for the other two honourable gentlemen were not only greater masters of
the game, and somewhat soberer than poor Booth, having, with all the art
in their power, evaded the bottle, but they had, moreover, another small
advantage over their adversaries, both of them, by means of some
certain private signs, previously agreed upon between them, being always
acquainted with the principal cards in each other's hands. It cannot be
wondered, therefore, that Fortune was on their side; for, however she
may be reported to favour fools, she never, I believe, shews them any
countenance when they engage in play with knaves.

The more Booth lost, the deeper he made his bets; the consequence of
which was, that about two in the morning, besides the loss of his own
money, he was fifty pounds indebted to Trent: a sum, indeed, which he
would not have borrowed, had not the other, like a very generous friend,
pushed it upon him.

Trent's pockets became at last dry by means of these loans. His own
loss, indeed, was trifling; for the stakes of the games were no higher
than crowns, and betting (as it is called) was that to which Booth
owed his ruin. The gentlemen, therefore, pretty well knowing Booth's
circumstances, and being kindly unwilling to win more of a man than he
was worth, declined playing any longer, nor did Booth once ask them to
persist, for he was ashamed of the debt which he had already contracted
to Trent, and very far from desiring to encrease it.

The company then separated. The two victors and Trent went off in their
chairs to their several houses near Grosvenor-square, and poor Booth, in
a melancholy mood, walked home to his lodgings. He was, indeed, in such
a fit of despair, that it more than once came into his head to put an
end to his miserable being.

But before we introduce him to Amelia we must do her the justice to
relate the manner in which she spent this unhappy evening. It was about
seven when Booth left her to walk in the park; from this time till
past eight she was employed with her children, in playing with them, in
giving them their supper, and in putting them to bed.

When these offices were performed she employed herself another hour
in cooking up a little supper for her husband, this being, as we have
already observed, his favourite meal, as indeed it was her's; and, in a
most pleasant and delightful manner, they generally passed their time at
this season, though their fare was very seldom of the sumptuous kind.

It now grew dark, and her hashed mutton was ready for the table, but no
Booth appeared. Having waited therefore for him a full hour, she gave
him over for that evening; nor was she much alarmed at his absence,
as she knew he was in a night or two to be at the tavern with some
brother-officers; she concluded therefore that they had met in the park,
and had agreed to spend this evening together.

At ten then she sat down to supper by herself, for Mrs. Atkinson was
then abroad. And here we cannot help relating a little incident, however
trivial it may appear to some. Having sat some time alone, reflecting on
their distressed situation, her spirits grew very low; and she was once
or twice going to ring the bell to send her maid for half-a-pint of
white wine, but checked her inclination in order to save the little sum
of sixpence, which she did the more resolutely as she had before refused
to gratify her children with tarts for their supper from the same
motive. And this self-denial she was very probably practising to
save sixpence, while her husband was paying a debt of several guineas
incurred by the ace of trumps being in the hands of his adversary.

Instead therefore of this cordial she took up one of the excellent
Farquhar's comedies, and read it half through; when, the clock striking
twelve, she retired to bed, leaving the maid to sit up for her master.
She would, indeed, have much more willingly sat up herself, but the
delicacy of her own mind assured her that Booth would not thank her
for the compliment. This is, indeed, a method which some wives take of
upbraiding their husbands for staying abroad till too late an hour, and
of engaging them, through tenderness and good nature, never to enjoy the
company of their friends too long when they must do this at the expence
of their wives' rest.

To bed then she went, but not to sleep. Thrice indeed she told the
dismal clock, and as often heard the more dismal watchman, till her
miserable husband found his way home, and stole silently like a thief to
bed to her; at which time, pretending then first to awake, she threw her
snowy arms around him; though, perhaps, the more witty property of snow,
according to Addison, that is to say its coldness, rather belonged to
the poor captain.




Chapter vi.

_Read, gamester, and observe_.


Booth could not so well disguise the agitations of his mind from Amelia,
but that she perceived sufficient symptoms to assure her that some
misfortune had befallen him. This made her in her turn so uneasy that
Booth took notice of it, and after breakfast said, "Sure, my dear Emily,
something hath fallen out to vex you."

Amelia, looking tenderly at him, answered, "Indeed, my dear, you are in
the right; I am indeed extremely vexed." "For Heaven's sake," said he,
"what is it?" "Nay, my love," cried she, "that you must answer yourself.
Whatever it is which hath given you all that disturbance that you
in vain endeavour to conceal from me, this it is which causes all my
affliction."

"You guess truly, my sweet," replied Booth; "I am indeed afflicted,
and I will not, nay I cannot, conceal the truth from you. I have undone
myself, Amelia."

"What have you done, child?" said she, in some consternation; "pray,
tell me."

"I have lost my money at play," answered he.

"Pugh!" said she, recovering herself--"what signifies the trifle you
had in your pocket? Resolve never to play again, and let it give you no
further vexation; I warrant you, we will contrive some method to repair
such a loss."

"Thou heavenly angel! thou comfort of my soul!" cried Booth, tenderly
embracing her; then starting a little from her arms, and looking with
eager fondness in her eyes, he said, "Let me survey thee; art thou
really human, or art thou not rather an angel in a human form? O, no,"
cried he, flying again into her arms, "thou art my dearest woman, my
best, my beloved wife!"

Amelia, having returned all his caresses with equal kindness, told him
she had near eleven guineas in her purse, and asked how much she should
fetch him. "I would not advise you, Billy, to carry too much in your
pocket, for fear it should be a temptation to you to return to gaming,
in order to retrieve your past losses. Let me beg you, on all accounts,
never to think more, if possible, on the trifle you have lost, anymore
than if you had never possessed it."

Booth promised her faithfully he never would, and refused to take any of
the money. He then hesitated a moment, and cried--"You say, my dear, you
have eleven guineas; you have a diamond ring, likewise, which was your
grandmother's--I believe that is worth twenty pounds; and your own and
the child's watch are worth as much more."

"I believe they would sell for as much," cried Amelia; "for a pawnbroker
of Mrs. Atkinson's acquaintance offered to lend me thirty-five pounds
upon them when you was in your last distress. But why are you computing
their value now?"

"I was only considering," answered he, "how much we could raise in any
case of exigency."

"I have computed it myself," said she; "and I believe all we have in
the world, besides our bare necessary apparel, would produce about sixty
pounds: and suppose, my dear," said she, "while we have that little sum,
we should think of employing it some way or other, to procure some small
subsistence for ourselves and our family. As for your dependence on the
colonel's friendship, it is all vain, I am afraid, and fallacious. Nor
do I see any hopes you have from any other quarter, of providing for
yourself again in the army. And though the sum which is now in our power
is very small, yet we may possibly contrive with it to put ourselves
into some mean way of livelihood. I have a heart, my Billy, which is
capable of undergoing anything for your sake; and I hope my hands are as
able to work as those which have been more inured to it. But think, my
dear, think what must be our wretched condition, when the very little we
now have is all mouldered away, as it will soon be in this town."

When poor Booth heard this, and reflected that the time which Amelia
foresaw was already arrived (for that he had already lost every farthing
they were worth), it touched him to the quick; he turned pale, gnashed
his teeth, and cried out, "Damnation! this is too much to bear."

Amelia was thrown into the utmost consternation by this behaviour; and,
with great terror in her countenance, cried out, "Good Heavens! my dear
love, what is the reason of this agony?"

"Ask me no questions," cried he, "unless you would drive me to madness."

"My Billy! my love!" said she, "what can be the meaning of this?--I beg
you will deal openly with me, and tell me all your griefs."

"Have you dealt fairly with me, Amelia?" said he.

"Yes, surely," said she; "Heaven is my witness how fairly."

"Nay, do not call Heaven," cried he, "to witness a falsehood. You have
not dealt openly with me, Amelia. You have concealed secrets from me;
secrets which I ought to have known, and which, if I had known, it had
been better for us both."

"You astonish me as much as you shock me," cried she. "What falsehood,
what treachery have I been guilty of?"

"You tell me," said he, "that I can have no reliance on James; why did
not you tell me so before?"

"I call Heaven again," said she, "to witness; nay, I appeal to yourself
for the truth of it; I have often told you so. I have told you I
disliked the man, notwithstanding the many favours he had done you. I
desired you not to have too absolute a reliance upon him. I own I had
once an extreme good opinion of him, but I changed it, and I acquainted
you that I had so--"

"But not," cries he, "with the reasons why you had changed it."

"I was really afraid, my dear," said she, "of going too far. I knew the
obligations you had to him; and if I suspected that he acted rather from
vanity than true friendship--"

"Vanity!" cries he; "take care, Amelia: you know his motive to be much
worse than vanity--a motive which, if he had piled obligations on me
till they had reached the skies, would tumble all down to hell. It is
vain to conceal it longer--I know all--your confidant hath told me all."

"Nay, then," cries she, "on my knees I entreat you to be pacified, and
hear me out. It was, my dear, for you, my dread of your jealous honour,
and the fatal consequences."

"Is not Amelia, then," cried he, "equally jealous of my honour? Would
she, from a weak tenderness for my person, go privately about to betray,
to undermine the most invaluable treasure of my soul? Would she have
me pointed at as the credulous dupe, the easy fool, the tame, the kind
cuckold, of a rascal with whom I conversed as a friend?"

"Indeed you injure me," said Amelia. "Heaven forbid I should have the
trial! but I think I could sacrifice all I hold most dear to preserve
your honour. I think I have shewn I can. But I will--when you are cool,
I will--satisfy you I have done nothing you ought to blame."

"I am cool then," cries he; "I will with the greatest coolness hear
you.--But do not think, Amelia, I have the least jealousy, the least
suspicion, the least doubt of your honour. It is your want of confidence
in me alone which I blame."

"When you are calm," cried she, "I will speak, and not before."

He assured her he was calm; and then she said, "You have justified my
conduct by your present passion, in concealing from you my suspicions;
for they were no more, nay, it is possible they were unjust; for since
the doctor, in betraying the secret to you, hath so far falsified my
opinion of him, why may I not be as well deceived in my opinion of the
colonel, since it was only formed on some particulars in his behaviour
which I disliked? for, upon my honour, he never spoke a word to me, nor
hath been ever guilty of any direct action, which I could blame."
She then went on, and related most of the circumstances which she had
mentioned to the doctor, omitting one or two of the strongest, and
giving such a turn to the rest, that, if Booth had not had some of
Othello's blood in him, his wife would have almost appeared a prude in
his eyes. Even he, however, was pretty well pacified by this narrative,
and said he was glad to find a possibility of the colonel's innocence;
but that he greatly commended the prudence of his wife, and only wished
she would for the future make him her only confidant.

Amelia, upon that, expressed some bitterness against the doctor
for breaking his trust; when Booth, in his excuse, related all the
circumstances of the letter, and plainly convinced her that the secret
had dropt by mere accident from the mouth of the doctor.

Thus the husband and wife became again reconciled, and poor Amelia
generously forgave a passion of which the sagacious reader is better
acquainted with the real cause than was that unhappy lady.




Chapter vii.

_In which Booth receives a visit from Captain Trent_.


When Booth grew perfectly cool, and began to reflect that he had broken
his word to the doctor, in having made the discovery to his wife
which we have seen in the last chapter, that thought gave him great
uneasiness; and now, to comfort him, Captain Trent came to make him a
visit.

This was, indeed, almost the last man in the world whose company he
wished for; for he was the only man he was ashamed to see, for a reason
well known to gamesters; among whom, the most dishonourable of all
things is not to pay a debt, contracted at the gaming-table, the next
day, or the next time at least that you see the party.

Booth made no doubt but that Trent was come on purpose to receive this
debt; the latter had been therefore scarce a minute in the room before
Booth began, in an aukward manner, to apologise; but Trent immediately
stopt his mouth, and said, "I do not want the money, Mr. Booth, and
you may pay it me whenever you are able; and, if you are never able, I
assure you I will never ask you for it."

This generosity raised such a tempest of gratitude in Booth (if I may be
allowed the expression), that the tears burst from his eyes, and it was
some time before he could find any utterance for those sentiments
with which his mind overflowed; but, when he began to express his
thankfulness, Trent immediately stopt him, and gave a sudden turn to
their discourse.

Mrs. Trent had been to visit Mrs. Booth on the masquerade evening, which
visit Mrs. Booth had not yet returned. Indeed, this was only the second
day since she had received it. Trent therefore now told his friend that
he should take it extremely kind if he and his lady would waive all
ceremony, and sup at their house the next evening. Booth hesitated a
moment, but presently said, "I am pretty certain my wife is not engaged,
and I will undertake for her. I am sure she will not refuse anything Mr.
Trent can ask." And soon after Trent took Booth with him to walk in the
Park.

There were few greater lovers of a bottle than Trent; he soon proposed
therefore to adjourn to the King's Arms tavern, where Booth, though
much against his inclination, accompanied him. But Trent was very
importunate, and Booth did not think himself at liberty to refuse such a
request to a man from whom he had so lately received such obligations.

When they came to the tavern, however, Booth recollected the omission he
had been guilty of the night before. He wrote a short note therefore to
his wife, acquainting her that he should not come home to supper; but
comforted her with a faithful promise that he would on no account engage
himself in gaming.

The first bottle passed in ordinary conversation; but, when they had
tapped the second, Booth, on some hints which Trent gave him, very
fairly laid open to him his whole circumstances, and declared he almost
despaired of mending them. "My chief relief," said he, "was in the
interest of Colonel James; but I have given up those hopes."

"And very wisely too," said Trent "I say nothing of the colonel's good
will. Very likely he may be your sincere friend; but I do not believe
he hath the interest he pretends to. He hath had too many favours in his
own family to ask any more yet a while. But I am mistaken if you have
not a much more powerful friend than the colonel; one who is both able
and willing to serve you. I dined at his table within these two days,
and I never heard kinder nor warmer expressions from the mouth of man
than he made use of towards you. I make no doubt you know whom I mean."

"Upon my honour I do not," answered Booth; "nor did I guess that I had
such a friend in the world as you mention."

"I am glad then," cries Trent, "that I have the pleasure of informing
you of it." He then named the noble peer who hath been already so often
mentioned in this history.

Booth turned pale and started at his name. "I forgive you, my dear
Trent," cries Booth, "for mentioning his name to me, as you are a
stranger to what hath passed between us."

"Nay, I know nothing that hath passed between you," answered Trent. "I
am sure, if there is any quarrel between you of two days' standing, all
is forgiven on his part."

"D--n his forgiveness!" said Booth. "Perhaps I ought to blush at what I
have forgiven."

"You surprize me!" cries Trent. "Pray what can be the matter?"

"Indeed, my dear Trent," cries Booth, very gravely, "he would have
injured me in the tenderest part. I know not how to tell it you; but he
would have dishonoured me with my wife."

"Sure, you are not in earnest!" answered Trent; "but, if you are, you
will pardon me for thinking that impossible."

"Indeed," cries Booth, "I have so good an opinion of my wife as to
believe it impossible for him to succeed; but that he should intend me
the favour you will not, I believe, think an impossibility."

"Faith! not in the least," said Trent. "Mrs. Booth is a very fine woman;
and, if I had the honour to be her husband, I should not be angry with
any man for liking her."

"But you would be angry," said Booth, "with a man, who should make use
of stratagems and contrivances to seduce her virtue; especially if he
did this under the colour of entertaining the highest friendship for
yourself."

"Not at all," cries Trent. "It is human nature."

"Perhaps it is," cries Booth; "but it is human nature depraved, stript
of all its worth, and loveliness, and dignity, and degraded down to a
level with the vilest brutes."

"Look ye, Booth," cries Trent, "I would not be misunderstood. I think,
when I am talking to you, I talk to a man of sense and to an inhabitant
of this country, not to one who dwells in a land of saints. If you have
really such an opinion as you express of this noble lord, you have the
finest opportunity of making a complete fool and bubble of him that any
man can desire, and of making your own fortune at the same time. I do
not say that your suspicions are groundless; for, of all men upon earth
I know, my lord is the greatest bubble to women, though I believe he
hath had very few. And this I am confident of, that he hath not the
least jealousy of these suspicions. Now, therefore, if you will act the
part of a wise man, I will undertake that you shall make your fortune
without the least injury to the chastity of Mrs. Booth."

"I do not understand you, sir," said Booth.

"Nay," cries Trent, "if you will not understand me, I have done. I meant
only your service; and I thought I had known you better."

Booth begged him to explain himself. "If you can," said he, "shew me
any way to improve such circumstances as I have opened to you, you may
depend on it I shall readily embrace it, and own my obligations to you."

"That is spoken like a man," cries Trent. "Why, what is it more than
this? Carry your suspicions in your own bosom. Let Mrs. Booth, in whose
virtue I am sure you may be justly confident, go to the public places;
there let her treat my lord with common civility only; I am sure he will
bite. And thus, without suffering him to gain his purpose, you will gain
yours. I know several who have succeeded with him in this manner."

"I am very sorry, sir," cries Booth, "that you are acquainted with any
such rascals. I do assure you, rather than I would act such a part,
I would submit to the hardest sentence that fortune could pronounce
against me."

"Do as you please, sir," said Trent; "I have only ventured to advise
you as a friend. But do you not think your nicety is a little
over-scrupulous?"

"You will excuse me, sir," said Booth; "but I think no man can be too
scrupulous in points which concern his honour."

"I know many men of very nice honour," answered Trent, "who have gone
much farther; and no man, I am sure, had ever a better excuse for it
than yourself. You will forgive me, Booth, since what I speak proceeds
from my love to you; nay, indeed, by mentioning your affairs to me,
which I am heartily sorry for, you have given me a right to speak. You
know best what friends you have to depend upon; but, if you have no
other pretensions than your merit, I can assure you you would fail, if
it was possible you could have ten times more merit than you have.
And, if you love your wife, as I am convinced you do, what must be your
condition in seeing her want the necessaries of life?"

"I know my condition is very hard," cries Booth; "but I have one comfort
in it, which I will never part with, and that is innocence. As to the
mere necessaries of life, however, it is pretty difficult to deprive us
of them; this I am sure of, no one can want them long."

"Upon my word, sir," cries Trent, "I did not know you had been so great
a philosopher. But, believe me, these matters look much less terrible at
a distance than when they are actually present. You will then find, I am
afraid, that honour hath no more skill in cookery than Shakspear tells
us it hath in surgery. D--n me if I don't wish his lordship loved my
wife as well as he doth yours, I promise you I would trust her virtue;
and, if he should get the better of it, I should have people of fashion
enough to keep me in countenance."

Their second bottle being now almost out, Booth, without making any
answer, called for a bill. Trent pressed very much the drinking another
bottle, but Booth absolutely refused, and presently afterwards they
parted, not extremely well satisfied with each other. They appeared,
indeed, one to the other, in disadvantageous lights of a very different
kind. Trent concluded Booth to be a very silly fellow, and Booth began
to suspect that Trent was very little better than a scoundrel.




Chapter viii.

_Contains a letter and other matters_.


We will now return to Amelia; to whom, immediately upon her husband's
departure to walk with Mr. Trent, a porter brought the following letter,
which she immediately opened and read:

"MADAM,--The quick despatch which I have given to your first commands
will I hope assure you of the diligence with which I shall always obey
every command that you are pleased to honour me with. I have, indeed, in
this trifling affair, acted as if my life itself had been at stake;
nay, I know not but it may be so; for this insignificant matter, you was
pleased to tell me, would oblige the charming person in whose power is
not only my happiness, but, as I am well persuaded, my life too. Let me
reap therefore some little advantage in your eyes, as you have in mine,
from this trifling occasion; for, if anything could add to the charms of
which you are mistress, it would be perhaps that amiable zeal with which
you maintain the cause of your friend. I hope, indeed, she will be my
friend and advocate with the most lovely of her sex, as I think she hath
reason, and as you was pleased to insinuate she had been. Let me beseech
you, madam, let not that dear heart, whose tenderness is so inclined
to compassionate the miseries of others, be hardened only against the
sufferings which itself occasions. Let not that man alone have reason to
think you cruel, who, of all others, would do the most to procure your
kindness. How often have I lived over in my reflections, in my dreams,
those two short minutes we were together! But, alas! how faint are these
mimicries of the imagination! What would I not give to purchase the
reality of such another blessing! This, madam, is in your power to
bestow on the man who hath no wish, no will, no fortune, no heart, no
life, but what are at your disposal. Grant me only the favour to be at
Lady----'s assembly. You can have nothing to fear from indulging me with
a moment's sight, a moment's conversation; I will ask no more. I know
your delicacy, and had rather die than offend it. Could I have seen you
sometimes, I believe the fear of offending you would have kept my love
for ever buried in my own bosom; but, to be totally excluded even from
the sight of what my soul doats on is what I cannot bear. It is that
alone which hath extorted the fatal secret from me. Let that obtain your
forgiveness for me. I need not sign this letter otherwise than with that
impression of my heart which I hope it bears; and, to conclude it in any
form, no language hath words of devotion strong enough to tell you with
what truth, what anguish, what zeal, what adoration I love you."

Amelia had just strength to hold out to the end, when her trembling grew
so violent that she dropt the letter, and had probably dropt herself,
had not Mrs. Atkinson come timely in to support her.

"Good Heavens!" cries Mrs. Atkinson, "what is the matter with you,
madam?"

"I know not what is the matter," cries Amelia; "but I have received a
letter at last from that infamous colonel."

"You will take my opinion again then, I hope, madam," cries Mrs.
Atkinson. "But don't be so affected; the letter cannot eat you or run
away with you. Here it lies, I see; will you give me leave to read it?"

"Read it with all my heart," cries Amelia; "and give me your advice how
to act, for I am almost distracted."

"Heydey!" says Mrs. Atkinson, "here is a piece of parchment too--what
is that?" In truth, this parchment had dropt from the letter when Amelia
first opened it; but her attention was so fixed by the contents of the
letter itself that she had never read the other. Mrs. Atkinson had now
opened the parchment first; and, after a moment's perusal, the fire
flashed from her eyes, and the blood flushed into her cheeks, and she
cried out, in a rapture, "It is a commission for my husband! upon my
soul, it is a commission for my husband:" and, at the same time, began
to jump about the room in a kind of frantic fit of joy.

"What can be the meaning of all this?" cries Amelia, under the highest
degree of astonishment.

"Do not I tell you, my dear madam," cries she, "that it is a commission
for my husband? and can you wonder at my being overjoyed at what I know
will make him so happy? And now it is all out. The letter is not from
the colonel, but from that noble lord of whom I have told you so much.
But, indeed, madam, I have some pardons to ask of you. However, I know
your goodness, and I will tell you all.

"You are to know then, madam, that I had not been in the Opera-house
six minutes before a masque came up, and, taking me by the hand, led me
aside. I gave the masque my hand; and, seeing a lady at that time lay
hold on Captain Booth, I took that opportunity of slipping away from
him; for though, by the help of the squeaking voice, and by attempting
to mimic yours, I had pretty well disguised my own, I was still afraid,
if I had much conversation with your husband, he would discover me. I
walked therefore away with this masque to the upper end of the farthest
room, where we sat down in a corner together. He presently discovered
to me that he took me for you, and I soon after found out who he was;
indeed, so far from attempting to disguise himself, he spoke in his own
voice and in his own person. He now began to make very violent love to
me, but it was rather in the stile of a great man of the present age
than of an Arcadian swain. In short, he laid his whole fortune at my
feet, and bade me make whatever terms I pleased, either for myself or
for others. By others, I suppose he meant your husband. This, however,
put a thought into my head of turning the present occasion to advantage.
I told him there were two kinds of persons, the fallaciousness of whose
promises had become proverbial in the world. These were lovers, and
great men. What reliance, then, could I have on the promise of one who
united in himself both those characters? That I had seen a melancholy
instance, in a very worthy woman of my acquaintance (meaning myself,
madam), of his want of generosity. I said I knew the obligations that
he had to this woman, and the injuries he had done her, all which I was
convinced she forgave, for that she had said the handsomest things in
the world of him to me. He answered that he thought he had not been
deficient in generosity to this lady (for I explained to him whom I
meant); but that indeed, if she had spoke well of him to me (meaning
yourself, madam), he would not fail to reward her for such an
obligation. I then told him she had married a very deserving man, who
had served long in the army abroad as a private man, and who was a
serjeant in the guards; that I knew it was so very easy for him to get
him a commission, that I should not think he had any honour or goodness
in the world if he neglected it. I declared this step must be a
preliminary to any good opinion he must ever hope for of mine. I then
professed the greatest friendship to that lady (in which I am convinced
you will think me serious), and assured him he would give me one of the
highest pleasures in letting me be the instrument of doing her such a
service. He promised me in a moment to do what you see, madam, he hath
since done. And to you I shall always think myself indebted for it."

"I know not how you are indebted to me," cries Amelia. "Indeed, I am
very glad of any good fortune that can attend poor Atkinson, but I wish
it had been obtained some other way. Good Heavens! what must be the
consequence of this? What must this lord think of me for listening to
his mention of love? nay, for making any terms with him? for what must
he suppose those terms mean? Indeed, Mrs. Atkinson, you carried it a
great deal too far. No wonder he had the assurance to write to me in the
manner he hath done. It is too plain what he conceives of me, and who
knows what he may say to others? You may have blown up my reputation by
your behaviour."

"How is that possible?" answered Mrs. Atkinson. "Is it not in my power
to clear up all matters? If you will but give me leave to make an
appointment in your name I will meet him myself, and declare the whole
secret to him."

"I will consent to no such appointment," cries Amelia. "I am heartily
sorry I ever consented to practise any deceit. I plainly see the truth
of what Dr Harrison hath often told me, that, if one steps ever so
little out of the ways of virtue and innocence, we know not how we may
slide, for all the ways of vice are a slippery descent."

"That sentiment," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "is much older than Dr Harrison.
_Omne vitium in proclivi est._"

"However new or old it is, I find it is true," cries Amelia--"But, pray,
tell me all, though I tremble to hear it."

"Indeed, my dear friend," said Mrs. Atkinson, "you are terrified at
nothing--indeed, indeed, you are too great a prude."

"I do not know what you mean by prudery," answered Amelia. "I shall
never be ashamed of the strictest regard to decency, to reputation,
and to that honour in which the dearest of all human creatures hath his
share. But, pray, give me the letter, there is an expression in it which
alarmed me when I read it. Pray, what doth he mean by his two short
minutes, and by purchasing the reality of such another blessing?"

"Indeed, I know not what he means by two minutes," cries Mrs. Atkinson,
"unless he calls two hours so; for we were not together much less. And
as for any blessing he had, I am a stranger to it. Sure, I hope you have
a better opinion of me than to think I granted him the last favour."

"I don't know what favours you granted him, madam," answered Amelia
peevishly, "but I am sorry you granted him any in my name."

"Upon my word," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "you use me unkindly, and it is an
usage I did not expect at your hands, nor do I know that I have deserved
it. I am sure I went to the masquerade with no other view than to oblige
you, nor did I say or do anything there which any woman who is not the
most confounded prude upon earth would have started at on a much less
occasion than what induced me. Well, I declare upon my soul then, that,
if I was a man, rather than be married to a woman who makes such a fuss
with her virtue, I would wish my wife was without such a troublesome
companion."

"Very possibly, madam, these may be your sentiments," cries Amelia, "and
I hope they are the sentiments of your husband."

"I desire, madam," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "you would not reflect on my
husband. He is a worthy man and as brave a man as yours; yes, madam, and
he is now as much a captain."

She spoke those words with so loud a voice, that Atkinson, who was
accidentally going up-stairs, heard them; and, being surprized at the
angry tone of his wife's voice, he entered the room, and, with a look of
much astonishment, begged to know what was the matter.

"The matter, my dear," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "is that I have got a
commission for you, and your good old friend here is angry with me for
getting it."

"I have not spirits enow," cries Amelia, "to answer you as you deserve;
and, if I had, you are below my anger."

"I do not know, Mrs. Booth," answered the other, "whence this great
superiority over me is derived; but, if your virtue gives it you, I
would have you to know, madam, that I despise a prude as much as you can
do a----."

"Though you have several times," cries Amelia, "insulted me with that
word, I scorn to give you any ill language in return. If you deserve any
bad appellation, you know it, without my telling it you."

Poor Atkinson, who was more frightened than he had ever been in his
life, did all he could to procure peace. He fell upon his knees to his
wife, and begged her to compose herself; for indeed she seemed to be in
a most furious rage.

While he was in this posture Booth, who had knocked so gently at the
door, for fear of disturbing his wife, that he had not been heard in the
tempest, came into the room. The moment Amelia saw him, the tears which
had been gathering for some time, burst in a torrent from her eyes,
which, however, she endeavoured to conceal with her handkerchief. The
entry of Booth turned all in an instant into a silent picture, in which
the first figure which struck the eyes of the captain was the serjeant
on his knees to his wife.

Booth immediately cried, "What's the meaning of this?" but received no
answer. He then cast his eyes towards Amelia, and, plainly discerning
her condition, he ran to her, and in a very tender phrase begged to know
what was the matter. To which she answered, "Nothing, my dear, nothing
of any consequence." He replied that he would know, and then turned to
Atkinson, and asked the same question.

Atkinson answered, "Upon my honour, sir, I know nothing of it. Something
hath passed between madam and my wife; but what it is I know no more
than your honour."

"Your wife," said Mrs. Atkinson, "hath used me cruelly ill, Mr. Booth.
If you must be satisfied, that is the whole matter."

Booth rapt out a great oath, and cried, "It is impossible; my wife is
not capable of using any one ill."

Amelia then cast herself upon her knees to her husband, and cried, "For
Heaven's sake do not throw yourself into a passion--some few words have
past--perhaps I may be in the wrong."

"Damnation seize me if I think so!" cries Booth. "And I wish whoever
hath drawn these tears from your eyes may pay it with as many drops of
their heart's blood."

"You see, madam," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "you have your bully to take your
part; so I suppose you will use your triumph."

Amelia made no answer, but still kept hold of Booth, who, in a violent
rage, cried out, "My Amelia triumph over such a wretch as thee!--What
can lead thy insolence to such presumption! Serjeant, I desire you'll
take that monster out of the room, or I cannot answer for myself."

The serjeant was beginning to beg his wife to retire (for he perceived
very plainly that she had, as the phrase is, taken a sip too much that
evening) when, with a rage little short of madness, she cried out,
"And do you tamely see me insulted in such a manner, now that you are a
gentleman, and upon a footing with him?"

"It is lucky for us all, perhaps," answered Booth, "that he is not my
equal."

"You lie, sirrah," said Mrs. Atkinson; "he is every way your equal;
he is as good a gentleman as yourself, and as much an officer. No, I
retract what I say; he hath not the spirit of a gentleman, nor of a man
neither, or he would not bear to see his wife insulted."

"Let me beg of you, my dear," cries the serjeant, "to go with me and
compose yourself."

"Go with thee, thou wretch!" cries she, looking with the utmost disdain
upon him; "no, nor ever speak to thee more." At which words she burst
out of the room, and the serjeant, without saying a word, followed her.

A very tender and pathetic scene now passed between Booth and his wife,
in which, when she was a little composed, she related to him the whole
story. For, besides that it was not possible for her otherwise to
account for the quarrel which he had seen, Booth was now possessed of
the letter that lay on the floor.

Amelia, having emptied her mind to her husband, and obtained his
faithful promise that he would not resent the affair to my lord,
was pretty well composed, and began to relent a little towards Mrs.
Atkinson; but Booth was so highly incensed with her, that he declared he
would leave her house the next morning; which they both accordingly
did, and immediately accommodated themselves with convenient apartments
within a few doors of their friend the doctor.




Chapter ix.

_Containing some things worthy observation._


Notwithstanding the exchange of his lodgings, Booth did not forget to
send an excuse to Mr. Trent, of whose conversation he had taken a full
surfeit the preceding evening.

That day in his walks Booth met with an old brother-officer, who had
served with him at Gibraltar, and was on half-pay as well as himself.
He had not, indeed, had the fortune of being broke with his regiment,
as was Booth, but had gone out, as they call it, on half-pay as a
lieutenant, a rank to which he had risen in five-and-thirty years.

This honest gentleman, after some discourse with Booth, desired him to
lend him half-a-crown, which he assured him he would faithfully pay the
next day, when he was to receive some money for his sister. The sister
was the widow of an officer that had been killed in the sea-service; and
she and her brother lived together, on their joint stock, out of which
they maintained likewise an old mother and two of the sister's children,
the eldest of which was about nine years old. "You must know," said
the old lieutenant, "I have been disappointed this morning by an old
scoundrel, who wanted fifteen per cent, for advancing my sister's
pension; but I have now got an honest fellow who hath promised it me
to-morrow at ten per cent."

"And enough too, of all conscience," cries Booth.

"Why, indeed, I think so too," answered the other; "considering it is
sure to be paid one time or other. To say the truth, it is a little hard
the government doth not pay those pensions better; for my sister's hath
been due almost these two years; that is my way of thinking."

Booth answered he was ashamed to refuse him such a sum; but, "Upon my
soul," said he, "I have not a single halfpenny in my pocket; for I am
in a worse condition, if possible, than yourself; for I have lost all
my money, and, what is worse, I owe Mr. Trent, whom you remember at
Gibraltar, fifty pounds."

"Remember him! yes, d--n him! I remember him very well," cries the old
gentleman, "though he will not remember me. He is grown so great now
that he will not speak to his old acquaintance; and yet I should be
ashamed of myself to be great in such a manner."

"What manner do you mean?" cries Booth, a little eagerly.

"Why, by pimping," answered the other; "he is pimp in ordinary to my
Lord----, who keeps his family; or how the devil he lives else I don't
know, for his place is not worth three hundred pounds a year, and he and
his wife spend a thousand at least. But she keeps an assembly, which, I
believe, if you was to call a bawdy-house, you would not misname it.
But d--n me if I had not rather be an honest man, and walk on foot, with
holes in my shoes, as I do now, or go without a dinner, as I and all my
family will today, than ride in a chariot and feast by such means. I
am honest Bob Bound, and always will be; that's my way of thinking; and
there's no man shall call me otherwise; for if he doth, I will knock him
down for a lying rascal; that is my way of thinking."

"And a very good way of thinking too," cries Booth. "However, you shall
not want a dinner to-day; for if you will go home with me, I will lend
you a crown with all my heart."

"Lookee," said the old man, "if it be anywise inconvenient to you I
will not have it; for I will never rob another man of his dinner to eat
myself--that is my way of thinking."

"Pooh!" said Booth; "never mention such a trifle twice between you and
me. Besides, you say you can pay it me to-morrow; and I promise you that
will be the same thing."

They then walked together to Booth's lodgings, where Booth, from
Amelia's pocket, gave his friend double the little sum he had asked.
Upon which the old gentleman shook him heartily by the hand, and,
repeating his intention of paying him the next day, made the best of his
way to a butcher's, whence he carried off a leg of mutton to a family
that had lately kept Lent without any religious merit.

When he was gone Amelia asked her husband who that old gentleman was?
Booth answered he was one of the scandals of his country; that the Duke
of Marlborough had about thirty years before made him an ensign from a
private man for very particular merit; and that he had not long since
gone out of the army with a broken heart, upon having several boys put
over his head. He then gave her an account of his family, which he had
heard from the old gentleman in their way to his house, and with which
we have already in a concise manner acquainted the reader.

"Good Heavens!" cries Amelia; "what are our great men made of? are they
in reality a distinct species from the rest of mankind? are they born
without hearts?"

"One would, indeed, sometimes," cries Booth, "be inclined to think
so. In truth, they have no perfect idea of those common distresses of
mankind which are far removed from their own sphere. Compassion, if
thoroughly examined, will, I believe, appear to be the fellow-feeling
only of men of the same rank and degree of life for one another, on
account of the evils to which they themselves are liable. Our sensations
are, I am afraid, very cold towards those who are at a great distance
from us, and whose calamities can consequently never reach us."

"I remember," cries Amelia, "a sentiment of Dr Harrison's, which he
told me was in some Latin book; _I am a man myself, and my heart is
interested in whatever can befal the rest of mankind_. That is the
sentiment of a good man, and whoever thinks otherwise is a bad one."

"I have often told you, my dear Emily," cries Booth, "that all men, as
well the best as the worst, act alike from the principle of self-love.
Where benevolence therefore is the uppermost passion, self-love directs
you to gratify it by doing good, and by relieving the distresses of
others; for they are then in reality your own. But where ambition,
avarice, pride, or any other passion, governs the man and keeps his
benevolence down, the miseries of all other men affect him no more than
they would a stock or a stone. And thus the man and his statue have
often the same degree of feeling or compassion."

"I have often wished, my dear," cries Amelia, "to hear you converse with
Dr Harrison on this subject; for I am sure he would convince you, though
I can't, that there are really such things as religion and virtue."

This was not the first hint of this kind which Amelia had given; for she
sometimes apprehended from his discourse that he was little better than
an atheist: a consideration which did not diminish her affection
for him, but gave her great uneasiness. On all such occasions Booth
immediately turned the discourse to some other subject; for, though he
had in other points a great opinion of his wife's capacity, yet as a
divine or a philosopher he did not hold her in a very respectable light,
nor did he lay any great stress on her sentiments in such matters. He
now, therefore, gave a speedy turn to the conversation, and began to
talk of affairs below the dignity of this history.




BOOK XI.



Chapter i.

_Containing a very polite scene._


We will now look back to some personages who, though not the principal
characters in this history, have yet made too considerable a figure in
it to be abruptly dropt: and these are Colonel James and his lady.

This fond couple never met till dinner the day after the masquerade,
when they happened to be alone together in an antechamber before the
arrival of the rest of the company.

The conversation began with the colonel's saying, "I hope, madam, you
got no cold last night at the masquerade." To which the lady answered by
much the same kind of question.

They then sat together near five minutes without opening their mouths
to each other. At last Mrs. James said, "Pray, sir, who was that masque
with you in the dress of a shepherdess? How could you expose yourself
by walking with such a trollop in public; for certainly no woman of any
figure would appear there in such a dress? You know, Mr. James, I never
interfere with your affairs; but I would, methinks, for my own sake, if
I was you, preserve a little decency in the face of the world."

"Upon my word," said James, "I do not know whom you mean. A woman in
such a dress might speak to me for aught I know. A thousand people
speak to me at a masquerade. But, I promise you, I spoke to no woman
acquaintance there that I know of. Indeed, I now recollect there was a
woman in a dress of a shepherdess; and there was another aukward thing
in a blue domino that plagued me a little, but I soon got rid of them."

"And I suppose you do not know the lady in the blue domino neither?"

"Not I, I assure you," said James. "But pray, why do you ask me these
questions? it looks so like jealousy."

"Jealousy!" cries she; "I jealous! no, Mr. James, I shall never be
jealous, I promise you, especially of the lady in the blue domino; for,
to my knowledge, she despises you of all human race."

"I am heartily glad of it," said James; "for I never saw such a tall
aukward monster in my life."

"That is a very cruel way of telling me you knew me."

"You, madam!" said James; "you was in a black domino."

"It is not so unusual a thing, I believe, you yourself know, to change
dresses. I own I did it to discover some of your tricks. I did not think
you could have distinguished the tall aukward monster so well."

"Upon my soul," said James, "if it was you I did not even suspect it; so
you ought not to be offended at what I have said ignorantly."

"Indeed, sir," cries she, "you cannot offend me by anything you can
say to my face; no, by my soul, I despise you too much. But I wish, Mr.
James, you would not make me the subject of your conversation amongst
your wenches. I desire I may not be afraid of meeting them for fear of
their insults; that I may not be told by a dirty trollop you make me the
subject of your wit amongst them, of which, it seems, I am the favourite
topic. Though you have married a tall aukward monster, Mr. James, I
think she hath a right to be treated, as your wife, with respect at
least: indeed, I shall never require any more; indeed, Mr. James, I
never shall. I think a wife hath a title to that."

"Who told you this, madam?" said James.

"Your slut," said she; "your wench, your shepherdess."

"By all that's sacred!" cries James, "I do not know who the shepherdess
was."

"By all that's sacred then," says she, "she told me so, and I am
convinced she told me truth. But I do not wonder at you denying it; for
that is equally consistent with honour as to behave in such a manner to
a wife who is a gentlewoman. I hope you will allow me that, sir. Because
I had not quite so great a fortune I hope you do not think me beneath
you, or that you did me any honour in marrying me. I am come of as good
a family as yourself, Mr. James; and if my brother knew how you treated
me he would not bear it."

"Do you threaten me with your brother, madam?" said James.

"I will not be ill-treated, sir," answered she.

"Nor I neither, madam," cries he; "and therefore I desire you will
prepare to go into the country to-morrow morning."

"Indeed, sir," said she, "I shall not."

"By heavens! madam, but you shall," answered he: "I will have my coach
at the door to-morrow morning by seven; and you shall either go into it
or be carried."

"I hope, sir, you are not in earnest," said she.

"Indeed, madam," answered he, "but I am in earnest, and resolved; and
into the country you go to-morrow."

"But why into the country," said she, "Mr. James? Why will you be so
barbarous to deny me the pleasures of the town?"

"Because you interfere with my pleasures," cried James, "which I have
told you long ago I would not submit to. It is enough for fond couples
to have these scenes together. I thought we had been upon a better
footing, and had cared too little for each other to become mutual
plagues. I thought you had been satisfied with the full liberty of doing
what you pleased."

"So I am; I defy you to say I have ever given you any uneasiness."

"How!" cries he; "have you not just now upbraided me with what you heard
at the masquerade?"

"I own," said she, "to be insulted by such a creature to my face stung
me to the soul. I must have had no spirit to bear the insults of such
an animal. Nay, she spoke of you with equal contempt. Whoever she is, I
promise you Mr. Booth is her favourite. But, indeed, she is unworthy any
one's regard, for she behaved like an arrant dragoon."

"Hang her!" cries the colonel, "I know nothing of her."

"Well, but, Mr. James, I am sure you will not send me into the country.
Indeed I will not go into the country."

"If you was a reasonable woman," cries James, "perhaps I should not
desire it. And on one consideration--"

"Come, name your consideration," said she.

"Let me first experience your discernment," said he. "Come, Molly, let
me try your judgment. Can you guess at any woman of your acquaintance
that I like?"

"Sure," said she, "it cannot be Mrs. Booth!"

"And why not Mrs. Booth?" answered he. "Is she not the finest woman in
the world?"

"Very far from it," replied she, "in my opinion."

"Pray what faults," said he, "can you find in her?"

"In the first place," cries Mrs. James, "her eyes are too large; and she
hath a look with them that I don't know how to describe; but I know I
don't like it. Then her eyebrows are too large; therefore, indeed, she
doth all in her power to remedy this with her pincers; for if it was
not for those her eyebrows would be preposterous. Then her nose, as
well proportioned as it is, has a visible scar on one side. Her neck,
likewise, is too protuberant for the genteel size, especially as she
laces herself; for no woman, in my opinion, can be genteel who is not
entirely flat before. And, lastly, she is both too short and too tall.
Well, you may laugh, Mr. James, I know what I mean, though I cannot well
express it: I mean that she is too tall for a pretty woman and too short
for a fine woman. There is such a thing as a kind of insipid medium--a
kind of something that is neither one thing nor another. I know not how
to express it more clearly; but when I say such a one is a pretty woman,
a pretty thing, a pretty creature, you know very well I mean a little
woman; and when I say such a one is a very fine woman, a very fine
person of a woman, to be sure I must mean a tall woman. Now a woman that
is between both is certainly neither the one nor the other."

"Well, I own," said he, "you have explained yourself with great
dexterity; but, with all these imperfections, I cannot help liking her."

"That you need not tell me, Mr. James," answered the lady, "for that
I knew before you desired me to invite her to your house. And
nevertheless, did not I, like an obedient wife, comply with your
desires? did I make any objection to the party you proposed for the
masquerade, though I knew very well your motive? what can the best of
wives do more? to procure you success is not in my power; and, if I may
give you my opinion, I believe you will never succeed with her."

"Is her virtue so very impregnable?" said he, with a sneer.

"Her virtue," answered Mrs. James, "hath the best guard in the world,
which is a most violent love for her husband."

"All pretence and affectation," cries the colonel. "It is impossible she
should have so little taste, or indeed so little delicacy, as to like
such a fellow."

"Nay, I do not much like him myself," said she. "He is not indeed at all
such a sort of man as I should like; but I thought he had been generally
allowed to be handsome."

"He handsome!" cries James. "What, with a nose like the proboscis of an
elephant, with the shoulders of a porter, and the legs of a chairman?
The fellow hath not in the least the look of a gentleman, and one would
rather think he had followed the plough than the camp all his life."

"Nay, now I protest," said she, "I think you do him injustice. He is
genteel enough in my opinion. It is true, indeed, he is not quite of the
most delicate make; but, whatever he is, I am convinced she thinks him
the finest man in the world."

"I cannot believe it," answered he peevishly; "but will you invite her
to dinner here to-morrow?"

"With all my heart, and as often as you please," answered she. "But I
have some favours to ask of you. First, I must hear no more of going out
of town till I please."

"Very well," cries he.

"In the next place," said she, "I must have two hundred guineas within
these two or three days."

"Well, I agree to that too," answered he.

"And when I do go out of town, I go to Tunbridge--I insist upon that;
and from Tunbridge I go to Bath--positively to Bath. And I promise you
faithfully I will do all in my power to carry Mrs. Booth with me."

"On that condition," answered he, "I promise you you shall go wherever
you please. And, to shew you, I will even prevent your wishes by my
generosity; as soon as I receive the five thousand pounds which I am
going to take up on one of my estates, you shall have two hundred more."

She thanked him with a low curtesie; and he was in such good humour that
he offered to kiss her. To this kiss she coldly turned her cheek, and
then, flirting her fan, said, "Mr. James, there is one thing I forgot
to mention to you--I think you intended to get a commission in some
regiment abroad for this young man. Now if you would take my advice,
I know this will not oblige his wife; and, besides, I am positive
she resolves to go with him. But, if you can provide for him in some
regiment at home, I know she will dearly love you for it, and when he is
ordered to quarters she will be left behind; and Yorkshire or Scotland,
I think, is as good a distance as either of the Indies."

"Well, I will do what I can," answered James; "but I cannot ask anything
yet; for I got two places of a hundred a year each for two of my
footmen, within this fortnight."

At this instant a violent knock at the door signified the arrival of
their company, upon which both husband and wife put on their best looks
to receive their guests; and, from their behaviour to each other during
the rest of the day, a stranger might have concluded he had been in
company with the fondest couple in the universe.




Chapter ii.

_Matters political._


Before we return to Booth we will relate a scene in which Dr Harrison
was concerned.

This good man, whilst in the country, happened to be in the
neighbourhood of a nobleman of his acquaintance, and whom he knew to
have very considerable interest with the ministers at that time.

The doctor, who was very well known to this nobleman, took this
opportunity of paying him a visit in order to recommend poor Booth to
his favour. Nor did he much doubt of his success, the favour he was to
ask being a very small one, and to which he thought the service of Booth
gave him so just a title.

The doctor's name soon gained him an admission to the presence of this
great man, who, indeed, received him with much courtesy and politeness;
not so much, perhaps, from any particular regard to the sacred function,
nor from any respect to the doctor's personal merit, as from some
considerations which the reader will perhaps guess anon. After many
ceremonials, and some previous discourse on different subjects, the
doctor opened the business, and told the great man that he was come to
him to solicit a favour for a young gentleman who had been an officer in
the army and was now on half-pay. "All the favour I ask, my lord," said
he, "is, that this gentleman may be again admitted _ad_ _eundem_. I am
convinced your lordship will do me the justice to think I would not
ask for a worthless person; but, indeed, the young man I mean hath
very extraordinary merit. He was at the siege of Gibraltar, in which he
behaved with distinguished bravery, and was dangerously wounded at two
several times in the service of his country. I will add that he is at
present in great necessity, and hath a wife and several children, for
whom he hath no other means of providing; and, if it will recommend him
farther to your lordship's favour, his wife, I believe, is one of the
best and worthiest of all her sex."

"As to that, my dear doctor," cries the nobleman, "I shall make no
doubt. Indeed any service I shall do the gentleman will be upon
your account. As to necessity, it is the plea of so many that it is
impossible to serve them all. And with regard to the personal merit of
these inferior officers, I believe I need not tell you that it is very
little regarded. But if you recommend him, let the person be what he
will, I am convinced it will be done; for I know it is in your power at
present to ask for a greater matter than this."

"I depend entirely upon your lordship," answered the doctor.

"Indeed, my worthy friend," replied the lord, "I will not take a merit
to myself which will so little belong to me. You are to depend on
yourself. It falls out very luckily too at this time, when you have it
in your power so greatly to oblige us."

"What, my lord, is in my power?" cries the doctor.

"You certainly know," answered his lordship, "how hard Colonel
Trompington is run at your town in the election of a mayor; they tell
me it will be a very near thing unless you join us. But we know it is
in your power to do the business, and turn the scale. I heard your
name mentioned the other day on that account, and I know you may have
anything in reason if you will give us your interest."

"Sure, my lord," cries the doctor, "you are not in earnest in asking my
interest for the colonel?"

"Indeed I am," answered the peer; "why should you doubt it?"

"For many reasons," answered the doctor. "First, I am an old friend and
acquaintance of Mr. Fairfield, as your lordship, I believe, very well
knows. The little interest, therefore, that I have, you may be assured,
will go in his favour. Indeed, I do not concern myself deeply in these
affairs, for I do not think it becomes my cloth so to do. But, as far as
I think it decent to interest myself, it will certainly be on the side
of Mr. Fairfield. Indeed, I should do so if I was acquainted with both
the gentlemen only by reputation; the one being a neighbouring gentleman
of a very large estate, a very sober and sensible man, of known probity
and attachment to the true interest of his country; the other is a mere
stranger, a boy, a soldier of fortune, and, as far as I can discern from
the little conversation I have had with him, of a very shallow capacity,
and no education."

"No education, my dear friend!" cries the nobleman. "Why, he hath been
educated in half the courts of Europe."

"Perhaps so, my lord," answered the doctor; "but I shall always be so
great a pedant as to call a man of no learning a man of no education.
And, from my own knowledge, I can aver that I am persuaded there is
scarce a foot-soldier in the army who is more illiterate than the
colonel."

"Why, as to Latin and Greek, you know," replied the lord, "they are not
much required in the army."

"It may be so," said the doctor. "Then let such persons keep to their
own profession. It is a very low civil capacity indeed for which an
illiterate man can be qualified. And, to speak a plain truth, if your
lordship is a friend to the colonel, you would do well to advise him
to decline an attempt in which I am certain he hath no probability of
success."

"Well, sir," said the lord, "if you are resolved against us, I must
deal as freely with you, and tell you plainly I cannot serve you in your
affair. Nay, it will be the best thing I can do to hold my tongue; for,
if I should mention his name with your recommendation after what you
have said, he would perhaps never get provided for as long as he lives."

"Is his own merit, then, my lord, no recommendation?" cries the doctor.

"My dear, dear sir," cries the other, "what is the merit of a subaltern
officer?"

"Surely, my lord," cries the doctor, "it is the merit which should
recommend him to the post of a subaltern officer. And it is a merit
which will hereafter qualify him to serve his country in a higher
capacity. And I do assure of this young man, that he hath not only a
good heart but a good head too. And I have been told by those who are
judges that he is, for his age, an excellent officer."

"Very probably!" cries my lord. "And there are abundance with the
same merit and the same qualifications who want a morsel of bread for
themselves and their families."

"It is an infamous scandal on the nation," cries the doctor; "and I am
heartily sorry it can be said even with a colour of truth."

"How can it be otherwise?" says the peer. "Do you think it is possible
to provide for all men of merit?"

"Yes, surely do I," said the doctor; "and very easily too."

"How, pray?" cries the lord. "Upon my word, I shall be glad to know."

"Only by not providing for those who have none. The men of merit in any
capacity are not, I am afraid, so extremely numerous that we need starve
any of them, unless we wickedly suffer a set of worthless fellows to eat
their bread."

"This is all mere Utopia," cries his lordship; "the chimerical system of
Plato's commonwealth, with which we amused ourselves at the university;
politics which are inconsistent with the state of human affairs."

"Sure, my lord," cries the doctor, "we have read of states where such
doctrines have been put in practice. What is your lordship's opinion
of Rome in the earlier ages of the commonwealth, of Sparta, and even of
Athens itself in some periods of its history?"

"Indeed, doctor," cries the lord, "all these notions are obsolete and
long since exploded. To apply maxims of government drawn from the Greek
and Roman histories to this nation is absurd and impossible. But, if you
will have Roman examples, fetch them from those times of the republic
that were most like our own. Do you not know, doctor, that this is as
corrupt a nation as ever existed under the sun? And would you think
of governing such a people by the strict principles of honesty and
morality?"

"If it be so corrupt," said the doctor, "I think it is high time to
amend it: or else it is easy to foresee that Roman and British liberty
will have the same fate; for corruption in the body politic as naturally
tends to dissolution as in the natural body."

"I thank you for your simile," cries my lord; "for, in the natural body,
I believe, you will allow there is the season of youth, the season of
manhood, and the season of old age; and that, when the last of these
arrives, it will be an impossible attempt by all the means of art to
restore the body again to its youth, or to the vigour of its middle age.
The same periods happen to every great kingdom. In its youth it rises
by arts and arms to power and prosperity. This it enjoys and flourishes
with a while; and then it may be said to be in the vigour of its age,
enriched at home with all the emoluments and blessings of peace, and
formidable abroad with all the terrors of war. At length this very
prosperity introduces corruption, and then comes on its old age. Virtue
and learning, art and industry, decay by degrees. The people sink into
sloth and luxury and prostitution. It is enervated at home--becomes
contemptible abroad; and such indeed is its misery and wretchedness,
that it resembles a man in the last decrepit stage of life, who looks
with unconcern at his approaching dissolution."

"This is a melancholy picture indeed," cries the doctor; "and, if
the latter part of it can be applied to our case, I see nothing
but religion, which would have prevented this decrepit state of the
constitution, should prevent a man of spirit from hanging himself out of
the way of so wretched a contemplation."

"Why so?" said the peer; "why hang myself, doctor? Would it not be
wiser, think you, to make the best of your time, and the most you can,
in such a nation?"

"And is religion, then, to be really laid out of the question?" cries
the doctor.

"If I am to speak my own opinion, sir," answered the peer, "you know I
shall answer in the negative. But you are too well acquainted with the
world to be told that the conduct of politicians is not formed upon the
principles of religion."

"I am very sorry for it," cries the doctor; "but I will talk to them
then of honour and honesty; this is a language which I hope they will at
least pretend to understand. Now to deny a man the preferment which
he merits, and to give it to another man who doth not merit it, is a
manifest act of injustice, and is consequently inconsistent with both
honour and honesty. Nor is it only an act of injustice to the man
himself, but to the public, for whose good principally all public
offices are, or ought to be, instituted. Now this good can never be
completed nor obtained but by employing all persons according to their
capacities. Wherever true merit is liable to be superseded by favour
and part richly dressed. That you gently chid me
for staying so long. All on a sudden appeared a coach with four horses
to it, in which was a maid-servant with our two children. We both
immediately went into the coach, and, taking our leave of the doctor,
set out towards your country-house; for yours I dreamt it was. I only
ask you now, if this was real, and the transition almost as sudden,
could you support it?"

Amelia was going to answer, when Mrs. Atkinson came into the room, and
after very little previous ceremony, presented Booth with a bank-note,
which he received of her, saying he would very soon repay it; a promise
that a little offended Amelia, as she thought he had no chance of
keeping it.

The doctor presently arrived, and the company sat down to breakfast,
during which Mrs. Atkinson entertained them with the history of the
doctors that had attended her husband, by whose advice Atkinson was
recovered from everything but the weakness which his distemper had
occasioned.

When the tea-table was removed Booth told the doctor that he had
acquainted his wife with a dream he had last night. "I dreamt, doctor,"
said he, "that she was restored to her estate."

"Very well," said the doctor; "and if I am to be the Oneiropolus, I
believe the dream will come to pass. To say the truth, I have rather a
better opinion of dreams than Horace had. Old Homer says they come
from Jupiter; and as to your dream, I have often had it in my waking
thoughts, that some time or other that roguery (for so I was always
convinced it was) would be brought to light; for the same Homer says, as
you, madam (meaning Mrs. Atkinson), very well know,

[Greek verses]

[Footnote: "If Jupiter doth not immediately execute his vengeance, he
will however execute it at last; and their transgressions shall fall
heavily on their own heads, and on their wives and children."]

"I have no Greek ears, sir," said Mrs. Atkinson. "I believe I could
understand it in the Delphin Homer."

"I wish," cries he, "my dear child (to Amelia), you would read a little
in the Delphin Aristotle, or else in some Christian divine, to learn
a doctrine which you will one day have a use for. I mean to bear the
hardest of all human conflicts, and support with an even temper, and
without any violent transports of mind, a sudden gust of prosperity."

"Indeed," cries Amelia, "I should almost think my husband and you,
doctor, had some very good news to tell me, by your using, both of you,
the same introduction. As far as I know myself, I think I can answer I
can support any degree of prosperity, and I think I yesterday shewed I
could: for I do assure you, it is not in the power of fortune to try
me with such another transition from grief to joy, as I conceived from
seeing my husband in prison and at liberty."

"Well, you are a good girl," cries the doctor, "and after I have put on
my spectacles I will try you."

The doctor then took out a newspaper, and read as follows:

"'Yesterday one Murphy, an eminent attorney-at-law, was committed to
Newgate for the forgery of a will under which an estate hath been for
many years detained from the right owner.'

"Now in this paragraph there is something very remarkable, and that
is--that it is true: but _opus est explanatu_. In the Delphin edition
of this newspaper there is the following note upon the words right
owner:--'The right owner of this estate is a young lady of the highest
merit, whose maiden name was Harris, and who some time since was married
to an idle fellow, one Lieutenant Booth. And the best historians assure
us that letters from the elder sister of this lady, which manifestly
prove the forgery and clear up the whole affair, are in the hands of an
old Parson called Doctor Harrison.'"

"And is this really true?" cries Amelia.

"Yes, really and sincerely," cries the doctor. "The whole estate;
for your mother left it you all, and is as surely yours as if you was
already in possession."

"Gracious Heaven!" cries she, falling on her knees, "I thank you!" And
then starting up, she ran to her husband, and, embracing him, cried, "My
dear love, I wish you joy; and I ought in gratitude to wish it you; for
you are the cause of mine. It is upon yours and my children's account
that I principally rejoice."

Mrs. Atkinson rose from her chair, and jumped about the room for joy,
repeating,

      _Turne, quod oplanti divum promittere nemo
         Auderet, volvenda dies, en, attulit ultro._

[Footnote: "What none of all the Gods could grant thy vows, That,
Turnus, this auspicious day bestows."]

Amelia now threw herself into a chair, complained she was a little
faint, and begged a glass of water. The doctor advised her to be
blooded; but she refused, saying she required a vent of another kind.
She then desired her children to be brought to her, whom she immediately
caught in her arms, and, having profusely cried over them for several
minutes, declared she was easy. After which she soon regained her usual
temper and complexion.

That day they dined together, and in the afternoon they all, except the
doctor, visited Captain Atkinson; he repaired to the bailiff's house
to visit the sick man, whom he found very chearful, the surgeon having
assured him that he was in no danger.

The doctor had a long spiritual discourse with Robinson, who assured
him that he sincerely repented of his past life, that he was resolved to
lead his future days in a different manner, and to make what amends
he could for his sins to the society, by bringing one of the greatest
rogues in it to justice. There was a circumstance which much pleased the
doctor, and made him conclude that, however Robinson had been corrupted
by his old master, he had naturally a good disposition. This was, that
Robinson declared he was chiefly induced to the discovery by what
had happened at the pawnbroker's, and by the miseries which he there
perceived he had been instrumental in bringing on Booth and his family.

The next day Booth and his wife, at the doctor's instance, dined
with Colonel James and his lady, where they were received with great
civility, and all matters were accommodated without Booth ever knowing a
syllable of the challenge even to this day.

The doctor insisted very strongly on having Miss Harris taken into
custody, and said, if she was his sister, he would deliver her to
justice. He added besides, that it was impossible to skreen her and
carry on the prosecution, or, indeed, recover the estate. Amelia at last
begged the delay of one day only, in which time she wrote a letter to
her sister, informing her of the discovery, and the danger in which she
stood, and begged her earnestly to make her escape, with many assurances
that she would never suffer her to know any distress. This letter she
sent away express, and it had the desired effect; for Miss Harris,
having received sufficient information from the attorney to the same
purpose, immediately set out for Poole, and from thence to France,
carrying with her all her money, most of her cloaths, and some few
jewels. She had, indeed, packed up plate and jewels to the value of two
thousand pound and upwards. But Booth, to whom Amelia communicated the
letter, prevented her by ordering the man that went with the express
(who had been a serjeant of the foot-guards recommended to him by
Atkinson) to suffer the lady to go whither she pleased, but not to take
anything with her except her cloaths, which he was carefully to search.
These orders were obeyed punctually, and with these she was obliged to
comply.

Two days after the bird was flown a warrant from the lord chief justice
arrived to take her up, the messenger of which returned with the news
of her flight, highly to the satisfaction of Amelia, and consequently of
Booth, and, indeed, not greatly to the grief of the doctor.

About a week afterwards Booth and Amelia, with their children, and
Captain Atkinson and his lady, all set forward together for Amelia's
house, where they arrived amidst the acclamations of all the neighbours,
and every public demonstration of joy.

They found the house ready prepared to receive them by Atkinson's friend
the old serjeant, and a good dinner prepared for them by Amelia's old
nurse, who was addressed with the utmost duty by her son and daughter,
most affectionately caressed by Booth and his wife, and by Amelia's
absolute command seated next to herself at the table. At which, perhaps,
were assembled some of the best and happiest people then in the world.




Chapter ix.

_In which the history is concluded._


Having brought our history to a conclusion, as to those points in which
we presume our reader was chiefly interested, in the foregoing chapter,
we shall in this, by way of epilogue, endeavour to satisfy his curiosity
as to what hath since happened to the principal personages of whom we
have treated in the foregoing pages.

Colonel James and his lady, after living in a polite manner for many
years together, at last agreed to live in as polite a manner asunder.
The colonel hath kept Miss Matthews ever since, and is at length
grown to doat on her (though now very disagreeable in her person, and
immensely fat) to such a degree, that he submits to be treated by her in
the most tyrannical manner.

He allows his lady eight hundred pound a-year, with which she divides
her time between Tunbridge, Bath, and London, and passes about nine
hours in the twenty-four at cards. Her income is lately increased by
three thousand pound left her by her brother Colonel Bath, who was
killed in a duel about six years ago by a gentleman who told the colonel
he differed from him in opinion.

The noble peer and Mrs. Ellison have been both dead several years, and
both of the consequences of their favourite vices; Mrs. Ellison having
fallen a martyr to her liquor, and the other to his amours, by which he
was at last become so rotten that he stunk above-ground.

The attorney, Murphy, was brought to his trial at the Old Bailey,
where, after much quibbling about the meaning of a very plain act
of parliament, he was at length convicted of forgery, and was soon
afterwards hanged at Tyburn.

The witness for some time seemed to reform his life, and received a
small pension from Booth; after which he returned to vicious courses,
took a purse on the highway, was detected and taken, and followed the
last steps of his old master. So apt are men whose manners have been
once thoroughly corrupted, to return, from any dawn of an amendment,
into the dark paths of vice.

As to Miss Harris, she lived three years with a broken heart at
Boulogne, where she received annually fifty pound from her sister, who
was hardly prevailed on by Dr Harrison not to send her a hundred, and
then died in a most miserable manner.

Mr. Atkinson upon the whole hath led a very happy life with his wife,
though he hath been sometimes obliged to pay proper homage to her
superior understanding and knowledge. This, however, he chearfully
submits to, and she makes him proper returns of fondness. They have two
fine boys, of whom they are equally fond. He is lately advanced to the
rank of captain, and last summer both he and his wife paid a visit of
three months to Booth and his wife.

Dr Harrison is grown old in years and in honour, beloved and respected
by all his parishioners and by all his neighbours. He divides his time
between his parish, his old town, and Booth's--at which last place he
had, two years ago, a gentle fit of the gout, being the first attack of
that distemper. During this fit Amelia was his nurse, and her two oldest
daughters sat up alternately with him for a whole week. The eldest of
those girls, whose name is Amelia, is his favourite; she is the picture
of her mother, and it is thought the doctor hath distinguished her in
his will, for he hath declared that he will leave his whole fortune,
except some few charities, among Amelia's children.

As to Booth and Amelia, Fortune seems to have made them large amends
for the tricks she played them in their youth. They have, ever since the
above period of this history, enjoyed an uninterrupted course of health
and happiness. In about six weeks after Booth's first coming into the
country he went to London and paid all his debts of honour; after which,
and a stay of two days only, he returned into the country, and hath
never since been thirty miles from home. He hath two boys and four
girls; the eldest of the boys, he who hath made his appearance in this
history, is just come from the university, and is one of the finest
gentlemen and best scholars of his age. The second is just going from
school, and is intended for the church, that being his own choice. His
eldest daughter is a woman grown, but we must not mention her age. A
marriage was proposed to her the other day with a young fellow of a
good estate, but she never would see him more than once: "For Doctor
Harrison," says she, "told me he was illiterate, and I am sure he is
ill-natured." The second girl is three years younger than her sister,
and the others are yet children.

Amelia is still the finest woman in England of her age. Booth himself
often avers she is as handsome as ever. Nothing can equal the serenity
of their lives. Amelia declared to me the other day, that she did not
remember to have seen her husband out of humour these ten years; and,
upon my insinuating to her that he had the best of wives, she answered
with a smile that she ought to be so, for that he had made her the
happiest of women.


THE END.

hich the brook ran, lying between us; the white man,
and all the rest, as he told us afterwards, not knowing well whether
they should stay or run away. However, it presently came into my
thoughts, that if there were white men among them, it would be much
easier to make them understand what we meant as to peace or war, than
we found it with others; so tying a piece of white rag to the end of a
stick, we sent two negroes with it to the bank of the water, carrying
the pole up as high as they could; it was presently understood, and two
of their men and the white man came to the shore on the other side.

However, as the white man spoke no Portuguese, they could understand
nothing of one another but by signs; but our men made the white man
understand that they had white men with them too, at which they said the
white man laughed. However, to be short, our men came back, and told us
they were all good friends, and in about an hour four of our men, two
negroes, and the black prince, went to the river-side, where the white
man came to them.

They had not been half a quarter of an hour, but a negro came running to
me, and told me the white man was Inglese, as he called him; upon which
I ran back, eagerly enough, you may be sure, with him, and found, as
he said, that he was an Englishman; upon which he embraced me very
passionately, the tears running down his face. The first surprise of his
seeing us was over before we came, but any one may conceive it by the
brief account he gave us afterwards of his very unhappy circumstances,
and of so unexpected a deliverance, such as perhaps never happened to
any man in the world, for it was a million to one odds that ever he
could have been relieved; nothing but an adventure that never was heard
or read of before could have suited his case, unless Heaven, by some
miracle that never was to be expected, had acted for him.

He appeared to be a gentleman, not an ordinary-bred fellow, seaman, or
labouring man; this showed itself in his behaviour in the first moment
of our conversing with him, and in spite of all the disadvantages of his
miserable circumstances.

He was a middle-aged man, not above thirty-seven or thirty-eight, though
his beard was grown exceedingly long, and the hair of his head and
face strangely covered him to the middle of his back and breast; he was
white, and his skin very fine, though discoloured, and in some places
blistered, and covered with a brown blackish substance, scurfy, scaly,
and hard, which was the effect of the scorching heat of the sun; he was
stark naked, and had been so, as he told us, upwards of two years.

He was so exceedingly transported at our meeting with him, that he could
scarce enter into any discourse at all with us that day; and when he
could get away from us for a little, we saw him walking alone, and
showing all the most extravagant tokens of an ungovernable joy; and even
afterwards he was never without tears in his eyes for several days,
upon the least word spoken by us of his circumstances, or by him of his
deliverance.

We found his behaviour the most courteous and endearing I ever saw
in any man whatever, and most evident tokens of a mannerly, well-bred
person appeared in all things he did or said, and our people were
exceedingly taken with him. He was a scholar and a mathematician; he
could not speak Portuguese indeed, but he spoke Latin to our surgeon,
French to another of our men, and Italian to a third.

He had no leisure in his thoughts to ask us whence we came, whither we
were going, or who we were; but would have it always as an answer to
himself, that to be sure, wherever we were a-going, we came from Heaven,
and were sent on purpose to save him from the most wretched condition
that ever man was reduced to.

Our men pitching their camp on the bank of a little river opposite to
him, he began to inquire what store of provisions we had, and how we
proposed to be supplied. When he found that our store was but small,
he said he would talk with the natives, and we should have provisions
enough; for he said they were the most courteous, good-natured part of
the inhabitants in all that part of the country, as we might suppose by
his living so safe among them.

The first things this gentleman did for us were indeed of the greatest
consequence to us; for, first, he perfectly informed us where we were,
and which was the properest course for us to steer; secondly, he put
us in the way how to furnish ourselves effectually with provisions; and
thirdly, he was our complete interpreter and peacemaker with all the
natives, who now began to be very numerous about us, and who were a
more fierce and politic people than those we had met with before; not so
easily terrified with our arms as those, and not so ignorant as to give
their provisions and corn for our little toys, such as, I said before,
our artificer made; but as they had frequently traded and conversed with
the Europeans on the coast, or with other negro nations that had traded
and been concerned with them, they were the less ignorant and the
less fearful, and consequently nothing was to be had from them but by
exchange for such things as they liked.

This I say of the negro natives, which we soon came among; but as to
these poor people that he lived among, they were not much acquainted
with things, being at the distance of above 300 miles from the coast;
only that they found elephants' teeth upon the hills to the north, which
they took and carried about sixty or seventy miles south, where other
trading negroes usually met them, and gave them beads, glass, shells,
and cowries, for them, such as the English and Dutch and other traders
furnish them with from Europe.

We now began to be more familiar with our new acquaintance; and first,
though we made but a sorry figure as to clothes ourselves, having
neither shoe, or stocking, or glove, or hat among us, and but very few
shirts, yet as well as we could we clothed him; and first, our surgeon
having scissors and razors, shaved him, and cut his hair; a hat, as I
say, we had not in all our stores, but he supplied himself by making
himself a cap of a piece of a leopard-skin, most artificially. As for
shoes or stockings, he had gone so long without them that he cared not
even for the buskins and foot-gloves we wore, which I described above.

As he had been curious to hear the whole story of our travels, and was
exceedingly delighted with the relation, so we were no less to know, and
pleased with, the account of his circumstances, and the history of his
coming to that strange place alone, and in that condition which we found
him in, as above. This account of his would indeed be in itself the
subject of an agreeable history, and would be as long and diverting as
our own, having in it many strange and extraordinary incidents; but we
cannot have room here to launch out into so long a digression: the sum
of his history was this:--

He had been a factor for the English Guinea Company at Sierra Leone,
or some other of their settlements which had been taken by the French,
where he had been plundered of all his own effects, as well as of what
was entrusted to him by the company. Whether it was that the company
did not do him justice in restoring his circumstances, or in further
employing him, he quitted their service, and was employed by those
called separate traders, and being afterwards out of employ there
also, traded on his own account; when, passing unwarily into one of the
company's settlements, he was either betrayed into the hands of some of
the natives, or, somehow or other, was surprised by them. However, as
they did not kill him, he found means to escape from them at that time,
and fled to another nation of the natives, who, being enemies to the
other, entertained him friendly, and with them he lived some time; but
not liking his quarters or his company, he fled again, and several times
changed his landlords: sometimes was carried by force, sometimes
hurried by fear, as circumstances altered with him (the variety of which
deserves a history by itself), till at last he had wandered beyond all
possibility of return, and had taken up his abode where we found him,
where he was well received by the petty king of the tribe he lived with;
and he, in return, instructed them how to value the product of their
labour, and on what terms to trade with those negroes who came up to
them for teeth.

As he was naked, and had no clothes, so he was naked of arms for his
defence, having neither gun, sword, staff, or any instrument of war
about him, no, not to guard himself against the attacks of a wild beast,
of which the country was very full. We asked him how he came to be so
entirely abandoned of all concern for his safety? He answered, that to
him, that had so often wished for death, life was not worth defending;
and that, as he was entirely at the mercy of the negroes, they had much
the more confidence in him, seeing he had no weapons to hurt them. As
for wild beasts, he was not much concerned about that, for he scarce
ever went from his hut; but if he did, the negro king and his men went
all with him, and they were all armed with bows and arrows, and lances,
with which they would kill any of the ravenous creatures, lions as
well as others; but that they seldom came abroad in the day; and if
the negroes wander anywhere in the night, they always build a hut for
themselves, and make a fire at the door of it, which is guard enough.

We inquired of him what we should next do towards getting to the
seaside. He told us we were about one hundred and twenty English leagues
from the coast, where almost all the European settlements and factories
were, and which is called the Gold Coast; but that there were so many
different nations of negroes in the way, that it was ten to one if
we were not either fought with continually, or starved for want of
provisions; but that there were two other ways to go, which, if he
had had any company to go with him, he had often contrived to make his
escape by. The one was to travel full west, which, though it was farther
to go, yet was not so full of people, and the people we should find
would be so much the civiller to us, or be so much the easier to fight
with; or that the other way was, if possible, to get to the Rio Grande,
and go down the stream in canoes. We told him, that was the way we had
resolved on before we met with him; but then he told us there was a
prodigious desert to go over, and as prodigious woods to go through,
before we came to it, and that both together were at least twenty days'
march for us, travel as hard as we could.

We asked him if there were no horses in the country, or asses, or even
bullocks or buffaloes, to make use of in such a journey, and we showed
him ours, of which we had but three left. He said no, all the country
did not afford anything of that kind.

He told us that in this great wood there were immense numbers of
elephants; and upon the desert, great multitudes of lions, lynxes,
tigers, leopards, &c.; and that it was to that wood and that desert that
the negroes went to get elephants' teeth, where they never failed to
find a great number.

We inquired still more, and particularly the way to the Gold Coast, and
if there were no rivers to ease us in our carriage; and told him, as to
the negroes fighting with us, we were not much concerned at that; nor
were we afraid of starving, for if they had any victuals among them, we
would have our share of it; and, therefore, if he would venture to show
us the way, we would venture to go; and as for himself, we told him we
would live and die together--there should not a man of us stir from him.

He told us, with all his heart, if we resolved it, and would venture, we
might be assured he would take his fate with us, and he would endeavour
to guide us in such a way as we should meet with some friendly savages
who would use us well, and perhaps stand by us against some others, who
were less tractable; so, in a word, we all resolved to go full south for
the Gold Coast.

The next morning he came to us again, and being all met in council, as
we may call it, he began to talk very seriously with us, that since
we were now come, after a long journey, to a view of the end of our
troubles, and had been so obliging to him as to offer to carry him with
us, he had been all night revolving in his mind what he and we all might
do to make ourselves some amends for all our sorrows; and first, he
said, he was to let me know that we were just then in one of the richest
parts of the world, though it was really otherwise but a desolate,
disconsolate wilderness; "for," says he, "there is not a river but runs
gold--not a desert but without ploughing bears a crop of ivory. What
mines of gold, what immense stores of gold, those mountains may contain,
from whence these rivers come, or the shores which these waters run
by, we know not, but may imagine that they must be inconceivably rich,
seeing so much is washed down the stream by the water washing the
sides of the land, that the quantity suffices all the traders which the
European world send thither." We asked him how far they went for it,
seeing the ships only trade upon the coast. He told us that the negroes
on the coast search the rivers up for the length of 150 or 200 miles,
and would be out a month, or two, or three at a time, and always come
home sufficiently rewarded; "but," says he, "they never come thus far,
and yet hereabouts is as much gold as there." Upon this he told us that
he believed he might have gotten a hundred pounds' weight of gold since
he came thither, if he had employed himself to look and work for it; but
as he knew not what to do with it, and had long since despaired of being
ever delivered from the misery he was in, he had entirely omitted it.
"For what advantage had it been to me," said he, "or what richer had
I been, if I had a ton of gold dust, and lay and wallowed in it? The
richness of it," said he, "would not give me one moment's felicity, nor
relieve me in the present exigency. Nay," says he, "as you all see, it
would not buy me clothes to cover me, or a drop of drink to save me from
perishing. It is of no value here," says he; "there are several people
among these huts that would weigh gold against a few glass beads or
a cockle-shell, and give you a handful of gold-dust for a handful
of cowries." N.B.--These are little shells which our children call
blackamoors' teeth.

When he had said thus he pulled out a piece of an earthen pot baked hard
in the sun. "Here," says he, "is some of the dirt of this country, and
if I would I could have got a great deal more;" and, showing it to us,
I believe there was in it between two and three pounds weight of
gold-dust, of the same kind and colour with that we had gotten already,
as before. After we had looked at it a while, he told us, smiling, we
were his deliverers, and all he had, as well as his life, was ours;
and therefore, as this would be of value to us when we came to our own
country, so he desired we would accept of it among us; and that was the
only time that he had repented that he had picked up no more of it.

I spoke for him, as his interpreter, to my comrades, and in their names
thanked him; but, speaking to them in Portuguese, I desired them to
defer the acceptance of his kindness to the next morning; and so I did,
telling him we would further talk of this part in the morning; so we
parted for that time.

When he was gone I found they were all wonderfully affected with
his discourse, and with the generosity of his temper, as well as
the magnificence of his present, which in another place had been
extraordinary. Upon the whole, not to detain you with circumstances, we
agreed that, seeing he was now one of our number, and that as we were a
relief to him in carrying him out of the dismal condition he was in, so
he was equally a relief to us, in being our guide through the rest of
the country, our interpreter with the natives, and our director how to
manage with the savages, and how to enrich ourselves with the wealth
of the country; that, therefore, we would put his gold among our common
stock, and every one should give him as much as would make his up just
as much as any single share of our own, and for the future we would take
our lot together, taking his solemn engagement to us, as we had before
one to another, that we would not conceal the least grain of gold we
found one from another.

In the next conference we acquainted him with the adventures of the
Golden River, and how we had shared what we got there, so that every man
had a larger stock than he for his share; that, therefore, instead of
taking any from him, we had resolved every one to add a little to him.
He appeared very glad that we had met with such good success, but would
not take a grain from us, till at last, pressing him very hard, he told
us, that then he would take it thus:--that, when we came to get any
more, he would have so much out of the first as should make him even,
and then we would go on as equal adventurers; and thus we agreed.

He then told us he thought it would not be an unprofitable adventure if,
before we set forward, and after we had got a stock of provisions, we
should make a journey north to the edge of the desert he had told us of,
from whence our negroes might bring every one a large elephant's tooth,
and that he would get some more to assist; and that, after a certain
length of carriage, they might be conveyed by canoes to the coast, where
they would yield a very great profit.

I objected against this on account of our other design we had of getting
gold-dust; and that our negroes, who we knew would be faithful to us,
would get much more by searching the rivers for gold for us than by
lugging a great tooth of a hundred and fifty pounds weight a hundred
miles or more, which would be an insufferable labour to them after so
hard a journey, and would certainly kill them.

He acquiesced in the justice of this answer, but fain would have had us
gone to see the woody part of the hill and the edge of the desert, that
we might see how the elephants' teeth lay scattered up and down there;
but when we told him the story of what we had seen before, as is said
above, he said no more.

We stayed here twelve days, during which time the natives were very
obliging to us, and brought us fruits, pompions, and a root like
carrots, though of quite another taste, but not unpleasant neither, and
some guinea-fowls, whose names we did not know. In short, they brought
us plenty of what they had, and we lived very well, and we gave them all
such little things as our cutler had made, for he had now a whole bag
full of them.

On the thirteenth day we set forward, taking our new gentleman with us.
At parting, the negro king sent two savages with a present to him of
some dried flesh, but I do not remember what it was, and he gave him
again three silver birds which our cutler helped him to, which I assure
you was a present for a king.

We travelled now south, a little west, and here we found the first
river for above 2000 miles' march, whose waters run south, all the rest
running north or west. We followed this river, which was no bigger than
a good large brook in England, till it began to increase its water.
Every now and then we found our Englishman went down as it were
privately to the water, which was to try the land; at length, after a
day's march upon this river, he came running up to us with his hands
full of sand, and saying, "Look here." Upon looking we found that a good
deal of gold lay spangled among the sand of the river. "Now," says he,
"I think we may begin to work;" so he divided our negroes into couples
and set them to work, to search and wash the sand and ooze in the bottom
of the water where it was not deep.

In the first day and a quarter our men all together had gathered a pound
and two ounces of gold or thereabouts, and as we found the quantity
increased the farther we went, we followed it about three days, till
another small rivulet joined the first, and then searching up the
stream, we found gold there too; so we pitched our camp in the angle
where the rivers joined, and we diverted ourselves, as I may call it,
in washing the gold out of the sand of the river, and in getting
provisions.

Here we stayed thirteen days more, in which time we had many pleasant
adventures with the savages, too long to mention here, and some of them
too homely to tell of, for some of our men had made something free with
their women, which, had not our new guide made peace for us with one of
their men at the price of seven fine bits of silver, which our artificer
had cut out into the shapes of lions, and fishes, and birds, and had
punched holes to hang them up by (an inestimable treasure), we must have
gone to war with them and all their people.

All the while we were busy washing gold-dust out of the rivers, and our
negroes the like, our ingenious cutler was hammering and cutting, and
he was grown so dexterous by use that he formed all manner of images. He
cut out elephants, tigers, civet cats, ostriches, eagles, cranes, fowls,
fishes, and indeed whatever he pleased, in thin plates of hammered gold,
for his silver and iron were almost all gone.

At one of the towns of these savage nations we were very friendly
received by their king, and as he was very much taken with our workman's
toys, he sold him an elephant cut out of a gold plate as thin as a
sixpence at an extravagant rate. He was so much taken with it that he
would not be quiet till he had given him almost a handful of gold-dust,
as they call it; I suppose it might weigh three-quarters of a pound; the
piece of gold that the elephant was made of might be about the weight of
a pistole, rather less than more. Our artist was so honest, though the
labour and art were all his own, that he brought all the gold and put
it into our common stock; but we had, indeed, no manner of reason in the
least to be covetous, for, as our new guide told us, we that were strong
enough to defend ourselves, and had time enough to stay (for we were
none of us in haste), might in time get together what quantity of gold
we pleased, even to an hundred pounds weight each man if we thought fit;
and therefore he told us, though he had as much reason to be sick of the
country as any of us, yet if we thought to turn our march a little to
the south-east, and pitch upon a place proper for our headquarters,
we might find provisions plenty enough, and extend ourselves over the
country among the rivers for two or three years to the right and left,
and we should soon find the advantage of it.

The proposal, however good as to the profitable part of it, suited none
of us, for we were all more desirous to get home than to be rich, being
tired of the excessive fatigue of above a year's continual wandering
among deserts and wild beasts.

However, the tongue of our new acquaintance had a kind of charm in it,
and used such arguments, and had so much the power of persuasion, that
there was no resisting him. He told us it was preposterous not to take
the fruit of all our labours now we were come to the harvest; that we
might see the hazard the Europeans run with ships and men, and at great
expense, to fetch a little gold, and that we, that were in the centre
of it, to go away empty-handed was unaccountable; that we were strong
enough to fight our way through whole nations, and might make our
journey afterward to what part of the coast we pleased, and we should
never forgive ourselves when we came to our own country to see we had
500 pistoles in gold, and might as easily have had 5000 or 10,000, or
what we pleased; that he was no more covetous than we, but seeing it
was in all our powers to retrieve our misfortunes at once, and to make
ourselves easy for all our lives, he could not be faithful to us, or
grateful for the good we had done him, if he did not let us see the
advantage we had in our hands; and he assured us he would make it clear
to our own understanding, that we might in two years' time, by good
management and by the help of our negroes, gather every man a hundred
pounds weight of gold, and get together perhaps two hundred ton of
teeth; whereas, if once we pushed on to the coast and separated, we
should never be able to see that place again with our eyes, or do any
more than sinners did with heaven,--wish themselves there, but know they
can never come at it.

Our surgeon was the first man that yielded to his reasoning, and after
him the gunner; and they too, indeed, had a great influence over us, but
none of the rest had any mind to stay, nor I neither, I must confess;
for I had no notion of a great deal of money, or what to do with myself,
or what to do with it if I had it. I thought I had enough already, and
all the thoughts I had about disposing of it, if I came to Europe, was
only how to spend it as fast as I could, buy me some clothes, and go to
sea again to be a drudge for more.

However, he prevailed with us by his good words at last to stay but for
six months in the country, and then, if we did resolve to go, he would
submit; so at length we yielded to that, and he carried us about fifty
English miles south-east, where we found several rivulets of water,
which seemed to come all from a great ridge of mountains, which lay to
the north-east, and which, by our calculation, must be the beginning
that way of the great waste, which we had been forced northward to
avoid.

Here we found the country barren enough, but yet we had by his direction
plenty of food; for the savages round us, upon giving them some of our
toys, as I have so often mentioned, brought us in whatever they had;
and here we found some maize, or Indian wheat, which the negro women
planted, as we sow seeds in a garden, and immediately our new provider
ordered some of our negroes to plant it, and it grew up presently, and
by watering it often, we had a crop in less than three months' growth.

As soon as we were settled, and our camp fixed, we fell to the old
trade of fishing for gold in the rivers mentioned above, and our English
gentleman so well knew how to direct our search, that we scarce ever
lost our labour.

One time, having set us to work, he asked if we would give him leave,
with four or five negroes, to go out for six or seven days to seek his
fortune, and see what he could discover in the country, assuring us
whatever he got should be for the public stock. We all gave him our
consent, and lent him a gun; and two of our men desiring to go with him,
they took then six negroes with them, and two of our buffaloes that
came with us the whole journey; they took about eight days' provision of
bread with them, but no flesh, except about as much dried flesh as would
serve them two days.

They travelled up to the top of the mountains I mentioned just now,
where they saw (as our men afterwards vouched it to be) the same desert
which we were so justly terrified at when we were on the farther side,
and which, by our calculation, could not be less than 300 miles broad
and above 600 miles in length, without knowing where it ended.

The journal of their travels is too long to enter upon here. They
stayed out two-and-fifty days, when they brought us seventeen pound and
something more (for we had no exact weight) of gold-dust, some of it in
much larger pieces than any we had found before, besides about fifteen
ton of elephants' teeth, which he had, partly by good usage and partly
by bad, obliged the savages of the country to fetch, and bring down to
him from the mountains, and which he made others bring with him quite
down to our camp. Indeed, we wondered what was coming to us when we saw
him attended with above 200 negroes; but he soon undeceived us, when he
made them all throw down their burdens on a heap at the entrance of our
camp.

Besides this, they brought two lions' skins, and five leopards' skins,
very large and very fine. He asked our pardon for his long stay, and
that he had made no greater a booty, but told us he had one excursion
more to make, which he hoped should turn to a better account.

So, having rested himself and rewarded the savages that brought the
teeth for him with some bits of silver and iron cut out diamond fashion,
and with two shaped like little dogs, he sent them away mightily
pleased.

The second journey he went, some more of our men desired to go with
him, and they made a troop of ten white men and ten savages, and the two
buffaloes to carry their provisions and ammunition. They took the same
course, only not exactly the same track, and they stayed thirty-two days
only, in which time they killed no less than fifteen leopards, three
lions, and several other creatures, and brought us home four-and-twenty
pound some ounces of gold-dust, and only six elephants' teeth, but they
were very great ones.

Our friend the Englishman showed us that now our time was well bestowed,
for in five months which we had stayed here, we had gathered so much
gold-dust that, when we came to share it, we had five pound and a
quarter to a man, besides what we had before, and besides six or seven
pound weight which we had at several times given our artificer to make
baubles with. And now we talked of going forward to the coast to put an
end to our journey; but our guide laughed at us then. "Nay, you can't go
now," says he, "for the rainy season begins next month, and there will
be no stirring then." This we found, indeed, reasonable, so we resolved
to furnish ourselves with provisions, that we might not be obliged to
go abroad too much in the rain, and we spread ourselves some one way and
some another, as far as we cared to venture, to get provisions; and our
negroes killed us some deer, which we cured as well as we could in the
sun, for we had now no salt.

By this time the rainy months were set in, and we could scarce, for
above two months, look out of our huts. But that was not all, for the
rivers were so swelled with the land-floods, that we scarce knew the
little brooks and rivulets from the great navigable rivers. This had
been a very good opportunity to have conveyed by water, upon rafts, our
elephants' teeth, of which we had a very great pile; for, as we always
gave the savages some reward for their labour, the very women would
bring us teeth upon every opportunity, and sometimes a great tooth
carried between two; so that our quantity was increased to about
two-and-twenty ton of teeth.

As soon as the weather proved fair again, he told us he would not press
us to any further stay, since we did not care whether we got any more
gold or no; that we were indeed the first men he ever met with in his
life that said they had gold enough, and of whom it might be truly said,
that, when it lay under our feet, we would not stoop to take it up. But,
since he had made us a promise, he would not break it, nor press us to
make any further stay; only he thought he ought to tell us that now was
the time, after the land-flood, when the greatest quantity of gold was
found; and that, if we stayed but one month, we should see thousands of
savages spread themselves over the whole country to wash the gold out
of the sand, for the European ships which would come on the coast; that
they do it then, because the rage of the floods always works down a
great deal of gold out of the hills; and, if we took the advantage to
be there before them, we did not know what extraordinary things we might
find.

This was so forcible, and so well argued, that it appeared in all our
faces we were prevailed upon; so we told him we would all stay: for
though it was true we were all eager to be gone, yet the evident
prospect of so much advantage could not well be resisted; that he was
greatly mistaken, when he suggested that we did not desire to increase
our store of gold, and in that we were resolved to make the utmost use
of the advantage that was in our hands, and would stay as long as any
gold was to be had, if it was another year.

He could hardly express the joy he was in on this occasion; and the fair
weather coming on, we began, just as he directed, to search about the
rivers for more gold. At first we had but little encouragement, and
began to be doubtful; but it was very plain that the reason was,
the water was not fully fallen, or the rivers reduced to their usual
channel; but in a few days we were fully requited, and found much more
gold than at first, and in bigger lumps; and one of our men washed out
of the sand a piece of gold as big as a small nut, which weighed, by our
estimation--for we had no small weights--almost an ounce and a half.

This success made us extremely diligent; and in little more than a month
we had altogether gotten near sixty pound weight of gold; but after
this, as he told us, we found abundance of the savages, men, women, and
children, hunting every river and brook, and even the dry land of the
hills for gold; so that we could do nothing like then, compared to what
we had done before.

But our artificer found a way to make other people find us in gold
without our own labour; for, when these people began to appear, he had
a considerable quantity of his toys, birds, beasts, &c., such as before,
ready for them; and the English gentleman being the interpreter, he
brought the savages to admire them; so our cutler had trade enough,
and, to be sure, sold his goods at a monstrous rate; for he would get an
ounce of gold, sometimes two, for a bit of silver, perhaps of the value
of a groat; nay, if it were iron and if it was of gold, they would
not give the more for it; and it was incredible almost to think what a
quantity of gold he got that way.

In a word, to bring this happy journey to a conclusion, we increased our
stock of gold here, in three months' stay more, to such a degree that,
bringing it all to a common stock, in order to share it, we divided
almost four pound weight again to every man; and then we set forward
for the Gold Coast, to see what method we could find out for our passage
into Europe.

There happened several remarkable incidents in this part of our journey,
as to how we were, or were not, received friendly by the several nations
of savages through which we passed; how we delivered one negro king
from captivity, who had been a benefactor to our new guide; and now our
guide, in gratitude, by our assistance, restored him to his kingdom,
which, perhaps, might contain about 300 subjects; how he entertained us;
and how he made his subjects go with our Englishmen, and fetch all our
elephants' teeth which we had been obliged to leave behind us, and to
carry them for us to the river, the name of which I forgot, where
we made rafts, and in eleven days more came down to one of the Dutch
settlements on the Gold Coast, where we arrived in perfect health, and
to our great satisfaction. As for our cargo of teeth, we sold it to the
Dutch factory, and received clothes and other necessaries for ourselves,
and such of our negroes as we thought fit to keep with us; and it is to
be observed, that we had four pound of gunpowder left when we ended our
journey. The negro prince we made perfectly free, clothed him out of our
common stock, and gave him a pound and a half of gold for himself, which
he knew very well how to manage; and here we all parted after the most
friendly manner possible. Our Englishman remained in the Dutch factory
some time, and, as I heard afterwards, died there of grief; for he
having sent a thousand pounds sterling over to England, by the way of
Holland, for his refuge at his return to his friends, the ship was taken
by the French and the effects all lost.

The rest of my comrades went away, in a small bark, to the two
Portuguese factories, near Gambia, in the latitude of fourteen; and I,
with two negroes which I kept with me, went away to Cape Coast Castle,
where I got passage for England, and arrived there in September; and
thus ended my first harvest of wild oats; the rest were not sowed to so
much advantage.

I had neither friend, relation, nor acquaintance in England, though it
was my native country; I had consequently no person to trust with what
I had, or to counsel me to secure or save it; but, falling into ill
company, and trusting the keeper of a public-house in Rotherhithe with a
great part of my money, and hastily squandering away the rest, all that
great sum, which I got with so much pains and hazard, was gone in little
more than two years' time; and, as I even rage in my own thoughts to
reflect upon the manner how it was wasted, so I need record no more; the
rest merits to be concealed with blushes, for that it was spent in all
kinds of folly and wickedness. So this scene of my life may be said to
have begun in theft, and ended in luxury; a sad setting-out, and a worse
coming home.

About the year ---- I began to see the bottom of my stock, and that
it was time to think of further adventures; for my spoilers, as I call
them, began to let me know, that as my money declined, their respect
would ebb with it, and that I had nothing to expect of them further than
as I might command it by the force of my money, which, in short, would
not go an inch the further for all that had been spent in their favour
before.

This shocked me very much, and I conceived a just abhorrence of their
ingratitude; but it wore off; nor had I met with any regret at the
wasting so glorious a sum of money as I brought to England with me.

I next shipped myself, in an evil hour to be sure, on a voyage to Cadiz,
in a ship called the ----, and in the course of our voyage, being on the
coast of Spain, was obliged to put into the Groyn, by a strong southwest
wind.

Here I fell into company with some masters of mischief; and, among them,
one, forwarder than the rest, began an intimate confidence with me,
so that we called one another brothers, and communicated all our
circumstances to one another. His name was Harris. This fellow came to
me one morning, asking me if I would go on shore, and I agreed; so we
got the captain's leave for the boat, and went together. When we were
together, he asked me if I had a mind for an adventure that might make
amends for all past misfortunes. I told him, yes, with all my heart; for
I did not care where I went, having nothing to lose, and no one to leave
behind me.

He then asked me if I would swear to be secret, and that, if I did not
agree to what he proposed, I would nevertheless never betray him. I
readily bound myself to that, upon the most solemn imprecations and
curses that the devil and both of us could invent.

He told me, then, there was a brave fellow in the other ship, pointing
to another English ship which rode in the harbour, who, in concert with
some of the men, had resolved to mutiny the next morning, and run away
with the ship; and that, if we could get strength enough among our
ship's company, we might do the same. I liked the proposal very well,
and he got eight of us to join with him, and he told us, that as soon as
his friend had begun the work, and was master of the ship, we should
be ready to do the like. This was his plot; and I, without the least
hesitation, either at the villainy of the fact or the difficulty of
performing it, came immediately into the wicked conspiracy, and so it
went on among us; but we could not bring our part to perfection.

Accordingly, on the day appointed, his correspondent in the other ship,
whose name was Wilmot, began the work, and, having seized the captain's
mate and other officers, secured the ship, and gave the signal to us.
We were but eleven in our ship, who were in the conspiracy, nor could we
get any more that we could trust; so that, leaving the ship, we all took
the boat, and went off to join the other.

Having thus left the ship I was in, we were entertained with a great
deal of joy by Captain Wilmot and his new gang; and, being well prepared
for all manner of roguery, bold, desperate (I mean myself), without the
least checks of conscience for what I was entered upon, or for anything
I might do, much less with any apprehension of what might be the
consequence of it; I say, having thus embarked with this crew, which at
last brought me to consort with the most famous pirates of the age, some
of whom have ended their journals at the gallows, I think the giving
an account of some of my other adventures may be an agreeable piece
of story; and this I may venture to say beforehand, upon the word of a
pirate, that I shall not be able to recollect the full, no, not by far,
of the great variety which has formed one of the most reprobate schemes
that ever man was capable to present to the world.

I that was, as I have hinted before, an original thief, and a pirate,
even by inclination before, was now in my element, and never undertook
anything in my life with more particular satisfaction.

Captain Wilmot (for so we are now to call him) being thus possessed of a
ship, and in the manner as you have heard, it may be easily concluded
he had nothing to do to stay in the port, or to wait either the attempts
that might be made from the shore, or any change that might happen among
his men. On the contrary, we weighed anchor the same tide, and stood out
to sea, steering away for the Canaries. Our ship had twenty-two guns,
but was able to carry thirty; and besides, as she was fitted out for
a merchant-ship only, she was not furnished either with ammunition or
small-arms sufficient for our design, or for the occasion we might have
in case of a fight. So we put into Cadiz, that is to say, we came to an
anchor in the bay; and the captain, and one whom we called young Captain
Kidd, who was the gunner, [landed,] and some of the men who could best
be trusted, among whom was my comrade Harris, who was made second mate,
and myself, who was made a lieutenant. Some bales of English goods were
proposed to be carried on shore with us for sale, but my comrade, who
was a complete fellow at his business, proposed a better way for it;
and having been in the town before, told us, in short, that he would buy
what powder and bullet, small-arms, or anything else we wanted, on his
own word, to be paid for when they came on board, in such English goods
as we had there. This was much the best way, and accordingly he and the
captain went on shore by themselves, and having made such a bargain
as they found for their turn, came away again in two hours' time, and
bringing only a butt of wine and five casks of brandy with them, we all
went on board again.

The next morning two _barcos longos_ came off to us, deeply laden, with
five Spaniards on board them, for traffic. Our captain sold them good
pennyworths, and they delivered us sixteen barrels of powder, twelve
small rundlets of fine powder for our small-arms, sixty muskets, and
twelve fusees for the officers; seventeen ton of cannon-ball, fifteen
barrels of musket-bullets, with some swords and twenty good pair of
pistols. Besides this, they brought thirteen butts of wine (for we, that
were now all become gentlemen, scorned to drink the ship's beer), also
sixteen puncheons of brandy, with twelve barrels of raisins and twenty
chests of lemons; all which we paid for in English goods; and, over and
above, the captain received six hundred pieces of eight in money. They
would have come again, but we would stay no longer.

From hence we sailed to the Canaries, and from thence onward to the
West Indies, where we committed some depredation upon the Spaniards for
provisions, and took some prizes, but none of any great value, while I
remained with them, which was not long at that time; for, having taken a
Spanish sloop on the coast of Carthagena, my friend made a motion to me,
that we should desire Captain Wilmot to put us into the sloop, with a
proportion of arms and ammunition, and let us try what we could do; she
being much fitter for our business than the great ship, and a better
sailer. This he consented to, and we appointed our rendezvous at Tobago,
making an agreement, that whatever was taken by either of our ships
should be shared among the ship's company of both; all which we very
punctually observed, and joined our ships again, about fifteen months
after, at the island of Tobago, as above.

We cruised near two years in those seas, chiefly upon the Spaniards;
not that we made any difficulty of taking English ships, or Dutch,
or French, if they came in our way; and particularly, Captain Wilmot
attacked a New England ship bound from the Madeiras to Jamaica, and
another bound from New York to Barbados, with provisions; which last was
a very happy supply to us. But the reason why we meddled as little with
English vessels as we could, was, first, because, if they were ships
of any force, we were sure of more resistance from them; and, secondly,
because we found the English ships had less booty when taken, for the
Spaniards generally had money on board, and that was what we best knew
what to do with. Captain Wilmot was, indeed, more particularly cruel
when he took any English vessel, that they might not too soon have
advice of him in England; and so the men-of-war have orders to look out
for him. But this part I bury in silence for the present.

We increased our stock in these two years considerably, having taken
60,000 pieces of eight in one vessel, and 100,000 in another; and being
thus first grown rich, we resolved to be strong too, for we had taken a
brigantine built at Virginia, an excellent sea-boat, and a good sailer,
and able to carry twelve guns; and a large Spanish frigate-built ship,
that sailed incomparably well also, and which afterwards, by the help
of good carpenters, we fitted up to carry twenty-eight guns. And now we
wanted more hands, so we put away for the Bay of Campeachy, not doubting
we should ship as many men there as we pleased; and so we did.

Here we sold the sloop that I was in; and Captain Wilmot keeping his
own ship, I took the command of the Spanish frigate as captain, and my
comrade Harris as eldest lieutenant, and a bold enterprising fellow
he was, as any the world afforded. One culverdine was put into the
brigantine, so that we were now three stout ships, well manned, and
victualled for twelve months; for we had taken two or three sloops from
New England and New York, laden with flour, peas, and barrelled beef and
pork, going for Jamaica and Barbados; and for more beef we went on
shore on the island of Cuba, where we killed as many black cattle as we
pleased, though we had very little salt to cure them.

Out of all the prizes we took here we took their powder and bullet,
their small-arms and cutlasses; and as for their men, we always took the
surgeon and the carpenter, as persons who were of particular use to
us upon many occasions; nor were they always unwilling to go with us,
though for their own security, in case of accidents, they might easily
pretend they were carried away by force; of which I shall give a
pleasant account in the course of my other expeditions.

We had one very merry fellow here, a Quaker, whose name was William
Walters, whom we took out of a sloop bound from Pennsylvania to
Barbados. He was a surgeon, and they called him doctor; but he was not
employed in the sloop as a surgeon, but was going to Barbados to get a
berth, as the sailors call it. However, he had all his surgeon's chests
on board, and we made him go with us, and take all his implements with
him. He was a comic fellow indeed, a man of very good solid sense, and
an excellent surgeon; but, what was worth all, very good-humoured and
pleasant in his conversation, and a bold, stout, brave fellow too, as
any we had among us.

I found William, as I thought, not very averse to go along with us, and
yet resolved to do it so that it might be apparent he was taken away
by force, and to this purpose he comes to me. "Friend," says he, "thou
sayest I must go with thee, and it is not in my power to resist thee if
I would; but I desire thou wilt oblige the master of the sloop which I
am on board to certify under his hand, that I was taken away by force
and against my will." And this he said with so much satisfaction in his
face, that I could not but understand him. "Ay, ay," says I, "whether
it be against your will or no, I'll make him and all the men give you
a certificate of it, or I'll take them all along with us, and keep them
till they do." So I drew up a certificate myself, wherein I wrote that
he was taken away by main force, as a prisoner, by a pirate ship; that
they carried away his chest and instruments first, and then bound his
hands behind him and forced him into their boat; and this was signed by
the master and all his men.

Accordingly I fell a-swearing at him, and called to my men to tie his
hands behind him, and so we put him into our boat and carried him away.
When I had him on board, I called him to me. "Now, friend," says I, "I
have brought you away by force, it is true, but I am not of the opinion
I have brought you away so much against your will as they imagine.
Come," says I, "you will be a useful man to us, and you shall have very
good usage among us." So I unbound his hands, and first ordered all
things that belonged to him to be restored to him, and our captain gave
him a dram.

"Thou hast dealt friendly by me," says he, "and I will be plain with
thee, whether I came willingly to thee or not. I shall make myself
as useful to thee as I can, but thou knowest it is not my business to
meddle when thou art to fight." "No, no," says the captain, "but you may
meddle a little when we share the money." "Those things are useful to
furnish a surgeon's chest," says William, and smiled, "but I shall be
moderate."

In short, William was a most agreeable companion; but he had the better
of us in this part, that if we were taken we were sure to be hanged, and
he was sure to escape; and he knew it well enough. But, in short, he
was a sprightly fellow, and fitter to be captain than any of us. I shall
have often an occasion to spepartner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port where we
had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left there; and
I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nankin, and
who came to Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nankin, where I bought
ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other
very fine silk of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these
brought to Pekin against my partner's return.  Besides this, we bought a
large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in
these goods only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling;
which, together with tea and some fine calicoes, and three camels' loads
of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share,
besides those we rode upon; these, with two or three spare horses, and
two horses loaded with provisions, made together twenty-six camels and
horses in our retinue.

The company was very great, and, as near as I can remember, made between
three and four hundred horses, and upwards of one hundred and twenty men,
very well armed and provided for all events; for as the Eastern caravans
are subject to be attacked by the Arabs, so are these by the Tartars.  The
company consisted of people of several nations, but there were above
sixty of them merchants or inhabitants of Moscow, though of them some
were Livonians; and to our particular satisfaction, five of them were
Scots, who appeared also to be men of great experience in business, and
of very good substance.

When we had travelled one day's journey, the guides, who were five in
number, called all the passengers, except the servants, to a great
council, as they called it.  At this council every one deposited a
certain quantity of money to a common stock, for the necessary expense of
buying forage on the way, where it was not otherwise to be had, and for
satisfying the guides, getting horses, and the like.  Here, too, they
constituted the journey, as they call it, viz. they named captains and
officers to draw us all up, and give the word of command, in case of an
attack, and give every one their turn of command; nor was this forming us
into order any more than what we afterwards found needful on the way.

The road all on this side of the country is very populous, and is full of
potters and earth-makers--that is to say, people, that temper the earth
for the China ware.  As I was coming along, our Portuguese pilot, who had
always something or other to say to make us merry, told me he would show
me the greatest rarity in all the country, and that I should have this to
say of China, after all the ill-humoured things that I had said of it,
that I had seen one thing which was not to be seen in all the world
beside.  I was very importunate to know what it was; at last he told me
it was a gentleman's house built with China ware.  "Well," says I, "are
not the materials of their buildings the products of their own country,
and so it is all China ware, is it not?"--"No, no," says he, "I mean it
is a house all made of China ware, such as you call it in England, or as
it is called in our country, porcelain."--"Well," says I, "such a thing
may be; how big is it?  Can we carry it in a box upon a camel?  If we can
we will buy it."--"Upon a camel!" says the old pilot, holding up both his
hands; "why, there is a family of thirty people lives in it."

I was then curious, indeed, to see it; and when I came to it, it was
nothing but this: it was a timber house, or a house built, as we call it
in England, with lath and plaster, but all this plastering was really
China ware--that is to say, it was plastered with the earth that makes
China ware.  The outside, which the sun shone hot upon, was glazed, and
looked very well, perfectly white, and painted with blue figures, as the
large China ware in England is painted, and hard as if it had been burnt.
As to the inside, all the walls, instead of wainscot, were lined with
hardened and painted tiles, like the little square tiles we call galley-
tiles in England, all made of the finest china, and the figures exceeding
fine indeed, with extraordinary variety of colours, mixed with gold, many
tiles making but one figure, but joined so artificially, the mortar being
made of the same earth, that it was very hard to see where the tiles met.
The floors of the rooms were of the same composition, and as hard as the
earthen floors we have in use in several parts of England; as hard as
stone, and smooth, but not burnt and painted, except some smaller rooms,
like closets, which were all, as it were, paved with the same tile; the
ceiling and all the plastering work in the whole house were of the same
earth; and, after all, the roof was covered with tiles of the same, but
of a deep shining black.  This was a China warehouse indeed, truly and
literally to be called so, and had I not been upon the journey, I could
have stayed some days to see and examine the particulars of it.  They
told me there were fountains and fishponds in the garden, all paved on
the bottom and sides with the same; and fine statues set up in rows on
the walks, entirely formed of the porcelain earth, burnt whole.

As this is one of the singularities of China, so they may be allowed to
excel in it; but I am very sure they excel in their accounts of it; for
they told me such incredible things of their performance in
crockery-ware, for such it is, that I care not to relate, as knowing it
could not be true.  They told me, in particular, of one workman that made
a ship with all its tackle and masts and sails in earthenware, big enough
to carry fifty men.  If they had told me he launched it, and made a
voyage to Japan in it, I might have said something to it indeed; but as
it was, I knew the whole of the story, which was, in short, that the
fellow lied: so I smiled, and said nothing to it.  This odd sight kept me
two hours behind the caravan, for which the leader of it for the day
fined me about the value of three shillings; and told me if it had been
three days' journey without the wall, as it was three days' within, he
must have fined me four times as much, and made me ask pardon the next
council-day.  I promised to be more orderly; and, indeed, I found
afterwards the orders made for keeping all together were absolutely
necessary for our common safety.

In two days more we passed the great China wall, made for a fortification
against the Tartars: and a very great work it is, going over hills and
mountains in an endless track, where the rocks are impassable, and the
precipices such as no enemy could possibly enter, or indeed climb up, or
where, if they did, no wall could hinder them.  They tell us its length
is near a thousand English miles, but that the country is five hundred in
a straight measured line, which the wall bounds without measuring the
windings and turnings it takes; it is about four fathoms high, and as
many thick in some places.

I stood still an hour or thereabouts without trespassing on our orders
(for so long the caravan was in passing the gate), to look at it on every
side, near and far off; I mean what was within my view: and the guide,
who had been extolling it for the wonder of the world, was mighty eager
to hear my opinion of it.  I told him it was a most excellent thing to
keep out the Tartars; which he happened not to understand as I meant it
and so took it for a compliment; but the old pilot laughed!  "Oh,
Seignior Inglese," says he, "you speak in colours."--"In colours!" said
I; "what do you mean by that?"--"Why, you speak what looks white this way
and black that way--gay one way and dull another.  You tell him it is a
good wall to keep out Tartars; you tell me by that it is good for nothing
but to keep out Tartars.  I understand you, Seignior Inglese, I
understand you; but Seignior Chinese understood you his own way."--"Well,"
says I, "do you think it would stand out an army of our country people,
with a good train of artillery; or our engineers, with two companies of
miners?  Would not they batter it down in ten days, that an army might
enter in battalia; or blow it up in the air, foundation and all, that
there should be no sign of it left?"--"Ay, ay," says he, "I know that."
The Chinese wanted mightily to know what I said to the pilot, and I gave
him leave to tell him a few days after, for we were then almost out of
their country, and he was to leave us a little time after this; but when
he knew what I said, he was dumb all the rest of the way, and we heard no
more of his fine story of the Chinese power and greatness while he
stayed.

After we passed this mighty nothing, called a wall, something like the
Picts' walls so famous in Northumberland, built by the Romans, we began
to find the country thinly inhabited, and the people rather confined to
live in fortified towns, as being subject to the inroads and depredations
of the Tartars, who rob in great armies, and therefore are not to be
resisted by the naked inhabitants of an open country.  And here I began
to find the necessity of keeping together in a caravan as we travelled,
for we saw several troops of Tartars roving about; but when I came to see
them distinctly, I wondered more that the Chinese empire could be
conquered by such contemptible fellows; for they are a mere horde of wild
fellows, keeping no order and understanding no discipline or manner of
it.  Their horses are poor lean creatures, taught nothing, and fit for
nothing; and this we found the first day we saw them, which was after we
entered the wilder part of the country.  Our leader for the day gave
leave for about sixteen of us to go a hunting as they call it; and what
was this but a hunting of sheep!--however, it may be called hunting too,
for these creatures are the wildest and swiftest of foot that ever I saw
of their kind! only they will not run a great way, and you are sure of
sport when you begin the chase, for they appear generally thirty or forty
in a flock, and, like true sheep, always keep together when they fly.

In pursuit of this odd sort of game it was our hap to meet with about
forty Tartars: whether they were hunting mutton, as we were, or whether
they looked for another kind of prey, we know not; but as soon as they
saw us, one of them blew a hideous blast on a kind of horn.  This was to
call their friends about them, and in less than ten minutes a troop of
forty or fifty more appeared, at about a mile distance; but our work was
over first, as it happened.

One of the Scots merchants of Moscow happened to be amongst us; and as
soon as he heard the horn, he told us that we had nothing to do but to
charge them without loss of time; and drawing us up in a line, he asked
if we were resolved.  We told him we were ready to follow him; so he rode
directly towards them.  They stood gazing at us like a mere crowd, drawn
up in no sort of order at all; but as soon as they saw us advance, they
let fly their arrows, which missed us, very happily.  Not that they
mistook their aim, but their distance; for their arrows all fell a little
short of us, but with so true an aim, that had we been about twenty yards
nearer we must have had several men wounded, if not killed.

Immediately we halted, and though it was at a great distance, we fired,
and sent them leaden bullets for wooden arrows, following our shot full
gallop, to fall in among them sword in hand--for so our bold Scot that
led us directed.  He was, indeed, but a merchant, but he behaved with
such vigour and bravery on this occasion, and yet with such cool courage
too, that I never saw any man in action fitter for command.  As soon as
we came up to them we fired our pistols in their faces and then drew; but
they fled in the greatest confusion imaginable.  The only stand any of
them made was on our right, where three of them stood, and, by signs,
called the rest to come back to them, having a kind of scimitar in their
hands, and their bows hanging to their backs.  Our brave commander,
without asking anybody to follow him, gallops up close to them, and with
his fusee knocks one of them off his horse, killed the second with his
pistol, and the third ran away.  Thus ended our fight; but we had this
misfortune attending it, that all our mutton we had in chase got away.  We
had not a man killed or hurt; as for the Tartars, there were about five
of them killed--how many were wounded we knew not; but this we knew, that
the other party were so frightened with the noise of our guns that they
fled, and never made any attempt upon us.

We were all this while in the Chinese dominions, and therefore the
Tartars were not so bold as afterwards; but in about five days we entered
a vast wild desert, which held us three days' and nights' march; and we
were obliged to carry our water with us in great leathern bottles, and to
encamp all night, just as I have heard they do in the desert of Arabia.  I
asked our guides whose dominion this was in, and they told me this was a
kind of border that might be called no man's land, being a part of Great
Karakathy, or Grand Tartary: that, however, it was all reckoned as
belonging to China, but that there was no care taken here to preserve it
from the inroads of thieves, and therefore it was reckoned the worst
desert in the whole march, though we were to go over some much larger.

In passing this frightful wilderness we saw, two or three times, little
parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and
to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who met the devil, if
they had nothing to say to us, we had nothing to say to them: we let them
go.  Once, however, a party of them came so near as to stand and gaze at
us.  Whether it was to consider if they should attack us or not, we knew
not; but when we had passed at some distance by them, we made a
rear-guard of forty men, and stood ready for them, letting the caravan
pass half a mile or thereabouts before us.  After a while they marched
off, but they saluted us with five arrows at their parting, which wounded
a horse so that it disabled him, and we left him the next day, poor
creature, in great need of a good farrier.  We saw no more arrows or
Tartars that time.

We travelled near a month after this, the ways not being so good as at
first, though still in the dominions of the Emperor of China, but lay for
the most part in the villages, some of which were fortified, because of
the incursions of the Tartars.  When we were come to one of these towns
(about two days and a half's journey before we came to the city of Naum),
I wanted to buy a camel, of which there are plenty to be sold all the way
upon that road, and horses also, such as they are, because, so many
caravans coming that way, they are often wanted.  The person that I spoke
to to get me a camel would have gone and fetched one for me; but I, like
a fool, must be officious, and go myself along with him; the place was
about two miles out of the village, where it seems they kept the camels
and horses feeding under a guard.

I walked it on foot, with my old pilot and a Chinese, being very desirous
of a little variety.  When we came to the place it was a low, marshy
ground, walled round with stones, piled up dry, without mortar or earth
among them, like a park, with a little guard of Chinese soldiers at the
door.  Having bought a camel, and agreed for the price, I came away, and
the Chinese that went with me led the camel, when on a sudden came up
five Tartars on horseback.  Two of them seized the fellow and took the
camel from him, while the other three stepped up to me and my old pilot,
seeing us, as it were, unarmed, for I had no weapon about me but my
sword, which could but ill defend me against three horsemen.  The first
that came up stopped short upon my drawing my sword, for they are arrant
cowards; but a second, coming upon my left, gave me a blow on the head,
which I never felt till afterwards, and wondered, when I came to myself,
what was the matter, and where I was, for he laid me flat on the ground;
but my never-failing old pilot, the Portuguese, had a pistol in his
pocket, which I knew nothing of, nor the Tartars either: if they had, I
suppose they would not have attacked us, for cowards are always boldest
when there is no danger.  The old man seeing me down, with a bold heart
stepped up to the fellow that had struck me, and laying hold of his arm
with one hand, and pulling him down by main force a little towards him,
with the other shot him into the head, and laid him dead upon the spot.
He then immediately stepped up to him who had stopped us, as I said, and
before he could come forward again, made a blow at him with a scimitar,
which he always wore, but missing the man, struck his horse in the side
of his head, cut one of the ears off by the root, and a great slice down
by the side of his face.  The poor beast, enraged with the wound, was no
more to be governed by his rider, though the fellow sat well enough too,
but away he flew, and carried him quite out of the pilot's reach; and at
some distance, rising upon his hind legs, threw down the Tartar, and fell
upon him.

In this interval the poor Chinese came in who had lost the camel, but he
had no weapon; however, seeing the Tartar down, and his horse fallen upon
him, away he runs to him, and seizing upon an ugly weapon he had by his
side, something like a pole-axe, he wrenched it from him, and made shift
to knock his Tartarian brains out with it.  But my old man had the third
Tartar to deal with still; and seeing he did not fly, as he expected, nor
come on to fight him, as he apprehended, but stood stock still, the old
man stood still too, and fell to work with his tackle to charge his
pistol again: but as soon as the Tartar saw the pistol away he scoured,
and left my pilot, my champion I called him afterwards, a complete
victory.

By this time I was a little recovered.  I thought, when I first began to
wake, that I had been in a sweet sleep; but, as I said above, I wondered
where I was, how I came upon the ground, and what was the matter.  A few
moments after, as sense returned, I felt pain, though I did not know
where; so I clapped my hand to my head, and took it away bloody; then I
felt my head ache: and in a moment memory returned, and everything was
present to me again.  I jumped upon my feet instantly, and got hold of my
sword, but no enemies were in view: I found a Tartar lying dead, and his
horse standing very quietly by him; and, looking further, I saw my
deliverer, who had been to see what the Chinese had done, coming back
with his hanger in his hand.  The old man, seeing me on my feet, came
running to me, and joyfully embraced me, being afraid before that I had
been killed.  Seeing me bloody, he would see how I was hurt; but it was
not much, only what we call a broken head; neither did I afterwards find
any great inconvenience from the blow, for it was well again in two or
three days.

We made no great gain, however, by this victory, for we lost a camel and
gained a horse.  I paid for the lost camel, and sent for another; but I
did not go to fetch it myself: I had had enough of that.

The city of Naum, which we were approaching, is a frontier of the Chinese
empire, and is fortified in their fashion.  We wanted, as I have said,
above two days' journey of this city when messengers were sent express to
every part of the road to tell all travellers and caravans to halt till
they had a guard sent for them; for that an unusual body of Tartars,
making ten thousand in all, had appeared in the way, about thirty miles
beyond the city.

This was very bad news to travellers: however, it was carefully done of
the governor, and we were very glad to hear we should have a guard.
Accordingly, two days after, we had two hundred soldiers sent us from a
garrison of the Chinese on our left, and three hundred more from the city
of Naum, and with these we advanced boldly.  The three hundred soldiers
from Naum marched in our front, the two hundred in our rear, and our men
on each side of our camels, with our baggage and the whole caravan in the
centre; in this order, and well prepared for battle, we thought ourselves
a match for the whole ten thousand Mogul Tartars, if they had appeared;
but the next day, when they did appear, it was quite another thing.




CHAPTER XV--DESCRIPTION OF AN IDOL, WHICH THEY DESTROY


Early in the morning, when marching from a little town called Changu, we
had a river to pass, which we were obliged to ferry; and, had the Tartars
had any intelligence, then had been the time to have attacked us, when
the caravan being over, the rear-guard was behind; but they did not
appear there.  About three hours after, when we were entered upon a
desert of about fifteen or sixteen miles over, we knew by a cloud of dust
they raised, that the enemy was at hand, and presently they came on upon
the spur.

Our Chinese guards in the front, who had talked so big the day before,
began to stagger; and the soldiers frequently looked behind them, a
certain sign in a soldier that he is just ready to run away.  My old
pilot was of my mind; and being near me, called out, "Seignior Inglese,
these fellows must be encouraged, or they will ruin us all; for if the
Tartars come on they will never stand it."--"If am of your mind," said I;
"but what must be done?"--"Done?" says he, "let fifty of our men advance,
and flank them on each wing, and encourage them.  They will fight like
brave fellows in brave company; but without this they will every man turn
his back."  Immediately I rode up to our leader and told him, who was
exactly of our mind; accordingly, fifty of us marched to the right wing,
and fifty to the left, and the rest made a line of rescue; and so we
marched, leaving the last two hundred men to make a body of themselves,
and to guard the camels; only that, if need were, they should send a
hundred men to assist the last fifty.

At last the Tartars came on, and an innumerable company they were; how
many we could not tell, but ten thousand, we thought, at the least.  A
party of them came on first, and viewed our posture, traversing the
ground in the front of our line; and, as we found them within gunshot,
our leader ordered the two wings to advance swiftly, and give them a
salvo on each wing with their shot, which was done.  They then went off,
I suppose to give an account of the reception they were like to meet
with; indeed, that salute cloyed their stomachs, for they immediately
halted, stood a while to consider of it, and wheeling off to the left,
they gave over their design for that time, which was very agreeable to
our circumstances.

Two days after we came to the city of Naun, or Naum; we thanked the
governor for his care of us, and collected to the value of a hundred
crowns, or thereabouts, which we gave to the soldiers sent to guard us;
and here we rested one day.  This is a garrison indeed, and there were
nine hundred soldiers kept here; but the reason of it was, that formerly
the Muscovite frontiers lay nearer to them than they now do, the
Muscovites having abandoned that part of the country, which lies from
this city west for about two hundred miles, as desolate and unfit for
use; and more especially being so very remote, and so difficult to send
troops thither for its defence; for we were yet above two thousand miles
from Muscovy properly so called.  After this we passed several great
rivers, and two dreadful deserts; one of which we were sixteen days
passing over; and on the 13th of April we came to the frontiers of the
Muscovite dominions.  I think the first town or fortress, whichever it
may he called, that belonged to the Czar, was called Arguna, being on the
west side of the river Arguna.

I could not but feel great satisfaction that I was arrived in a country
governed by Christians; for though the Muscovites do, in my opinion, but
just deserve the name of Christians, yet such they pretend to be, and are
very devout in their way.  It would certainly occur to any reflecting man
who travels the world as I have done, what a blessing it is to be brought
into the world where the name of God and a Redeemer is known, adored, and
worshipped; and not where the people, given up to strong delusions,
worship the devil, and prostrate themselves to monsters, elements, horrid-
shaped animals, and monstrous images.  Not a town or city we passed
through but had their pagodas, their idols, and their temples, and
ignorant people worshipping even the works of their own hands.  Now we
came where, at least, a face of the Christian worship appeared; where the
knee was bowed to Jesus: and whether ignorantly or not, yet the Christian
religion was owned, and the name of the true God was called upon and
adored; and it made my soul rejoice to see it.  I saluted the brave Scots
merchant with my first acknowledgment of this; and taking him by the
hand, I said to him, "Blessed be God, we are once again amongst
Christians."  He smiled, and answered, "Do not rejoice too soon,
countryman; these Muscovites are but an odd sort of Christians; and but
for the name of it you may see very little of the substance for some
months further of our journey."--"Well," says I, "but still it is better
than paganism, and worshipping of devils."--"Why, I will tell you," says
he; "except the Russian soldiers in the garrisons, and a few of the
inhabitants of the cities upon the road, all the rest of this country,
for above a thousand miles farther, is inhabited by the worst and most
ignorant of pagans."  And so, indeed, we found it.

We now launched into the greatest piece of solid earth that is to be
found in any part of the world; we had, at least, twelve thousand miles
to the sea eastward; two thousand to the bottom of the Baltic Sea
westward; and above three thousand, if we left that sea, and went on
west, to the British and French channels: we had full five thousand miles
to the Indian or Persian Sea south; and about eight hundred to the Frozen
Sea north.

We advanced from the river Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, and were
very visibly obliged to the care the Czar has taken to have cities and
towns built in as many places as it is possible to place them, where his
soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed by
the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire; some of which I had
read of were placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the
lodging of travellers.  Thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at
these towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians, and
professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans, sacrificing
to idols, and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of
heaven; and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans that
ever I met with, the most barbarous, except only that they did not eat
men's flesh.

Some instances of this we met with in the country between Arguna, where
we enter the Muscovite dominions, and a city of Tartars and Russians
together, called Nortziousky, in which is a continued desert or forest,
which cost us twenty days to travel over.  In a village near the last of
these places I had the curiosity to go and see their way of living, which
is most brutish and unsufferable.  They had, I suppose, a great sacrifice
that day; for there stood out, upon an old stump of a tree, a diabolical
kind of idol made of wood; it was dressed up, too, in the most filthy
manner; its upper garment was of sheepskins, with the wool outward; a
great Tartar bonnet on the head, with two horns growing through it; it
was about eight feet high, yet had no feet or legs, nor any other
proportion of parts.

This scarecrow was set up at the outer side of the village; and when I
came near to it there were sixteen or seventeen creatures all lying flat
upon the ground round this hideous block of wood; I saw no motion among
them, any more than if they had been all logs, like the idol, and at
first I really thought they had been so; but, when I came a little
nearer, they started up upon their feet, and raised a howl, as if it had
been so many deep-mouthed hounds, and walked away, as if they were
displeased at our disturbing them.  A little way off from the idol, and
at the door of a hut, made of sheep and cow skins dried, stood three men
with long knives in their hands; and in the middle of the tent appeared
three sheep killed, and one young bullock.  These, it seems, were
sacrifices to that senseless log of an idol; the three men were priests
belonging to it, and the seventeen prostrated wretches were the people
who brought the offering, and were offering their prayers to that stock.

I confess I was more moved at their stupidity and brutish worship of a
hobgoblin than ever I was at anything in my life, and, overcome with
rage, I rode up to the hideous idol, and with my sword made a stroke at
the bonnet that was on its head, and cut it in two; and one of our men
that was with me, taking hold of the sheepskin that covered it, pulled at
it, when, behold, a most hideous outcry ran through the village, and two
or three hundred people came about my ears, so that I was glad to scour
for it, for some had bows and arrows; but I resolved from that moment to
visit them again.  Our caravan rested three nights at the town, which was
about four miles off, in order to provide some horses which they wanted,
several of the horses having been lamed and jaded with the long march
over the last desert; so we had some leisure here to put my design in
execution.  I communicated it to the Scots merchant, of whose courage I
had sufficient testimony; I told him what I had seen, and with what
indignation I had since thought that human nature could be so degenerate;
I told him if I could get but four or five men well armed to go with me,
I was resolved to go and destroy that vile, abominable idol, and let them
see that it had no power to help itself, and consequently could not be an
object of worship, or to be prayed to, much less help them that offered
sacrifices to it.

He at first objected to my plan as useless, seeing that, owing to the
gross ignorance of the people, they could not be brought to profit by the
lesson I meant to teach them; and added that, from his knowledge of the
country and its customs, he feared we should fall into great peril by
giving offence to these brutal idol worshippers.  This somewhat stayed my
purpose, but I was still uneasy all that day to put my project in
execution; and that evening, meeting the Scots merchant in our walk about
the town, I again called upon him to aid me in it.  When he found me
resolute he said that, on further thoughts, he could not but applaud the
design, and told me I should not go alone, but he would go with me; but
he would go first and bring a stout fellow, one of his countrymen, to go
also with us; "and one," said he, "as famous for his zeal as you can
desire any one to be against such devilish things as these."  So we
agreed to go, only we three and my man-servant, and resolved to put it in
execution the following night about midnight, with all possible secrecy.

We thought it better to delay it till the next night, because the caravan
being to set forward in the morning, we suppose the governor could not
pretend to give them any satisfaction upon us when we were out of his
power.  The Scots merchant, as steady in his resolution for the
enterprise as bold in executing, brought me a Tartar's robe or gown of
sheepskins, and a bonnet, with a bow and arrows, and had provided the
same for himself and his countryman, that the people, if they saw us,
should not determine who we were.  All the first night we spent in mixing
up some combustible matter, with aqua vitae, gunpowder, and such other
materials as we could get; and having a good quantity of tar in a little
pot, about an hour after night we set out upon our expedition.

We came to the place about eleven o'clock at night, and found that the
people had not the least suspicion of danger attending their idol.  The
night was cloudy: yet the moon gave us light enough to see that the idol
stood just in the same posture and place that it did before.  The people
seemed to be all at their rest; only that in the great hut, where we saw
the three priests, we saw a light, and going up close to the door, we
heard people talking as if there were five or six of them; we concluded,
therefore, that if we set wildfire to the idol, those men would come out
immediately, and run up to the place to rescue it from destruction; and
what to do with them we knew not.  Once we thought of carrying it away,
and setting fire to it at a distance; but when we came to handle it, we
found it too bulky for our carriage, so we were at a loss again.  The
second Scotsman was for setting fire to the hut, and knocking the
creatures that were there on the head when they came out; but I could not
join with that; I was against killing them, if it were possible to avoid
it.  "Well, then," said the Scots merchant, "I will tell you what we will
do: we will try to make them prisoners, tie their hands, and make them
stand and see their idol destroyed."

As it happened, we had twine or packthread enough about us, which we used
to tie our firelocks together with; so we resolved to attack these people
first, and with as little noise as we could.  The first thing we did, we
knocked at the door, when one of the priests coming to it, we immediately
seized upon him, stopped his mouth, and tied his hands behind him, and
led him to the idol, where we gagged him that he might not make a noise,
tied his feet also together, and left him on the ground.

Two of us then waited at the door, expecting that another would come out
to see what the matter was; but we waited so long till the third man came
back to us; and then nobody coming out, we knocked again gently, and
immediately out came two more, and we served them just in the same
manner, but were obliged to go all with them, and lay them down by the
idol some distance from one another; when, going back, we found two more
were come out of the door, and a third stood behind them within the door.
We seized the two, and immediately tied them, when the third, stepping
back and crying out, my Scots merchant went in after them, and taking out
a composition we had made that would only smoke and stink, he set fire to
it, and threw it in among them.  By that time the other Scotsman and my
man, taking charge of the two men already bound, and tied together also
by the arm, led them away to the idol, and left them there, to see if
their idol would relieve them, making haste back to us.

When the fuze we had thrown in had filled the hut with so much smoke that
they were almost suffocated, we threw in a small leather bag of another
kind, which flamed like a candle, and, following it in, we found there
were but four people, who, as we supposed, had been about some of their
diabolical sacrifices.  They appeared, in short, frightened to death, at
least so as to sit trembling and stupid, and not able to speak either,
for the smoke.

We quickly took them from the hut, where the smoke soon drove us out,
bound them as we had done the other, and all without any noise.  Then we
carried them all together to the idol; when we came there, we fell to
work with him.  First, we daubed him all over, and his robes also, with
tar, and tallow mixed with brimstone; then we stopped his eyes and ears
and mouth full of gunpowder, and wrapped up a great piece of wildfire in
his bonnet; then sticking all the combustibles we had brought with us
upon him, we looked about to see if we could find anything else to help
to burn him; when my Scotsman remembered that by the hut, where the men
were, there lay a heap of dry forage; away he and the other Scotsman ran
and fetched their arms full of that.  When we had done this, we took all
our prisoners, and brought them, having untied their feet and ungagged
their mouths, and made them stand up, and set them before their monstrous
idol, and then set fire to the whole.

We stayed by it a quarter of an hour or thereabouts, till the powder in
the eyes and mouth and ears of the idol blew up, and, as we could
perceive, had split altogether; and in a word, till we saw it burned so
that it would soon be quite consumed.  We then began to think of going
away; but the Scotsman said, "No, we must not go, for these poor deluded
wretches will all throw themselves into the fire, and burn themselves
with the idol."  So we resolved to stay till the forage has burned down
too, and then came away and left them.  After the feat was performed, we
appeared in the morning among our fellow-travellers, exceedingly busy in
getting ready for our journey; nor could any man suppose that we had been
anywhere but in our beds.

But the affair did not end so; the next day came a great number of the
country people to the town gates, and in a most outrageous manner
demanded satisfaction of the Russian governor for the insulting their
priests and burning their great Cham Chi-Thaungu.  The people of
Nertsinkay were at first in a great consternation, for they said the
Tartars were already no less than thirty thousand strong.  The Russian
governor sent out messengers to appease them, assuring them that he knew
nothing of it, and that there had not a soul in his garrison been abroad,
so that it could not be from anybody there: but if they could let him
know who did it, they should be exemplarily punished.  They returned
haughtily, that all the country reverenced the great Cham Chi-Thaungu,
who dwelt in the sun, and no mortal would have dared to offer violence to
his image but some Christian miscreant; and they therefore resolved to
denounce war against him and all the Russians, who, they said, were
miscreants and Christians.

The governor, unwilling to make a breach, or to have any cause of war
alleged to be given by him, the Czar having strictly charged him to treat
the conquered country with gentleness, gave them all the good words he
could.  At last he told them there was a caravan gone towards Russia that
morning, and perhaps it was some of them who had done them this injury;
and that if they would be satisfied with that, he would send after them
to inquire into it.  This seemed to appease them a little; and
accordingly the governor sent after us, and gave us a particular account
how the thing was; intimating withal, that if any in our caravan had done
it they should make their escape; but that whether we had done it or no,
we should make all the haste forward that was possible: and that, in the
meantime, he would keep them in play as long as he could.

This was very friendly in the governor; however, when it came to the
caravan, there was nobody knew anything of the matter; and as for us that
were guilty, we were least of all suspected.  However, the captain of the
caravan for the time took the hint that the governor gave us, and we
travelled two days and two nights without any considerable stop, and then
we lay at a village called Plothus: nor did we make any long stop here,
but hastened on towards Jarawena, another Muscovite colony, and where we
expected we should be safe.  But upon the second day's march from
Plothus, by the clouds of dust behind us at a great distance, it was
plain we were pursued.  We had entered a vast desert, and had passed by a
great lake called Schanks Oser, when we perceived a large body of horse
appear on the other side of the lake, to the north, we travelling west.
We observed they went away west, as we did, but had supposed we would
have taken that side of the lake, whereas we very happily took the south
side; and in two days more they disappeared again: for they, believing we
were still before them, pushed on till they came to the Udda, a very
great river when it passes farther north, but when we came to it we found
it narrow and fordable.

The third day they had either found their mistake, or had intelligence of
us, and came pouring in upon us towards dusk.  We had, to our great
satisfaction, just pitched upon a convenient place for our camp; for as
we had just entered upon a desert above five hundred miles over, where we
had no towns to lodge at, and, indeed, expected none but the city
Jarawena, which we had yet two days' march to; the desert, however, had
some few woods in it on this side, and little rivers, which ran all into
the great river Udda; it was in a narrow strait, between little but very
thick woods, that we pitched our camp that night, expecting to be
attacked before morning.  As it was usual for the Mogul Tartars to go
about in troops in that desert, so the caravans always fortify themselves
every night against them, as against armies of robbers; and it was,
therefore, no new thing to be pursued.  But we had this night a most
advantageous camp: for as we lay between two woods, with a little rivulet
running just before our front, we could not be surrounded, or attacked
any way but in our front or rear.  We took care also to make our front as
strong as we could, by placing our packs, with the camels and horses, all
in a line, on the inside of the river, and felling some trees in our
rear.

In this posture we encamped for the night; but the enemy was upon us
before we had finished.  They did not come on like thieves, as we
expected, but sent three messengers to us, to demand the men to be
delivered to them that had abused their priests and burned their idol,
that they might burn them with fire; and upon this, they said, they would
go away, and do us no further harm, otherwise they would destroy us all.
Our men looked very blank at this message, and began to stare at one
another to see who looked with the most guilt in their faces; but nobody
was the word--nobody did it.  The leader of the caravan sent word he was
well assured that it was not done by any of our camp; that we were
peaceful merchants, travelling on our business; that we had done no harm
to them or to any one else; and that, therefore, they must look further
for the enemies who had injured them, for we were not the people; so they
desired them not to disturb us, for if they did we should defend
ourselves.

They were far from being satisfied with this for an answer: and a great
crowd of them came running down in the morning, by break of day, to our
camp; but seeing us so well posted, they durst come no farther than the
brook in our front, where they stood in such number as to terrify us very
much; indeed, some spoke of ten thousand.  Here they stood and looked at
us a while, and then, setting up a great howl, let fly a crowd of arrows
among us; but we were well enough sheltered under our baggage, and I do
not remember that one of us was hurt.

Some time after this we saw them move a little to our right, and expected
them on the rear: when a cunning fellow, a Cossack of Jarawena, calling
to the leader of the caravan, said to him, "I will send all these people
away to Sibeilka."  This was a city four or five days' journey at least
to the right, and rather behind us.  So he takes his bow and arrows, and
getting on horseback, he rides away from our rear directly, as it were
back to Nertsinskay; after this he takes a great circuit about, and comes
directly on the army of the Tartars as if he had been sent express to
tell them a long story that the people who had burned the Cham
Chi-Thaungu were gone to Sibeilka, with a caravan of miscreants, as he
called them--that is to say, Christians; and that they had resolved to
burn the god Scal-Isar, belonging to the Tonguses.  As this fellow was
himself a Tartar, and perfectly spoke their language, he counterfeited so
well that they all believed him, and away they drove in a violent hurry
to Sibeilka.  In less than three hours they were entirely out of our
sight, and we never heard any more of them, nor whether they went to
Sibeilka or no.  So we passed away safely on to Jarawena, where there was
a Russian garrison, and there we rested five days.

From this city we had a frightful desert, which held us twenty-three
days' march.  We furnished ourselves with some tents here, for the better
accommodating ourselves in the night; and the leader of the caravan
procured sixteen waggons of the country, for carrying our water or
provisions, and these carriages were our defence every night round our
little camp; so that had the Tartars appeared, unless they had been very
numerous indeed, they would not have been able to hurt us.  We may well
be supposed to have wanted rest again after this long journey; for in
this desert we neither saw house nor tree, and scarce a bush; though we
saw abundance of the sable-hunters, who are all Tartars of Mogul Tartary;
of which this country is a part; and they frequently attack small
caravans, but we saw no numbers of them together.

After we had passed this desert we came into a country pretty well
inhabited--that is to say, we found towns and castles, settled by the
Czar with garrisons of stationary soldiers, to protect the caravans and
defend the country against the Tartars, who would otherwise make it very
dangerous travelling; and his czarish majesty has given such strict
orders for the well guarding the caravans, that, if there are any Tartars
heard of in the country, detachments of the garrison are always sent to
see the travellers safe from station to station.  Thus the governor of
Adinskoy, whom I had an opportunity to make a visit to, by means of the
Scots merchant, who was acquainted with him, offered us a guard of fifty
men, if we thought there was any danger, to the next station.

I thought, long before this, that as we came nearer to Europe we should
find the country better inhabited, and the people more civilised; but I
found myself mistaken in both: for we had yet the nation of the Tonguses
to pass through, where we saw the same tokens of paganism and barbarity
as before; only, as they were conquered by the Muscovites, they were not
so dangerous, but for rudeness of manners and idolatry no people in the
world ever went beyond them.  They are all clothed in skins of beasts,
and their houses are built of the same; you know not a man from a woman,
neither by the ruggedness of their countenances nor their clothes; and in
the winter, when the ground is covered with snow, they live underground
in vaults, which have cavities going from one to another.  If the Tartars
had their Cham Chi-Thaungu for a whole village or country, these had
idols in every hut and every cave.  This country, I reckon, was, from the
desert I spoke of last, at least four hundred miles, half of it being
another desert, which took us up twelve days' severe travelling, without
house or tree; and we were obliged again to carry our own provisions, as
well water as bread.  After we were out of this desert and had travelled
two days, we came to Janezay, a Muscovite city or station, on the great
river Janezay, which, they told us there, parted Europe from Asia.

All the country between the river Oby and the river Janezay is as
entirely pagan, and the people as barbarous, as the remotest of the
Tartars.  I also found, which I observed to the Muscovite governors whom
I had an opportunity to converse with, that the poor pagans are not much
wiser, or nearer Christianity, for being under the Muscovite government,
which they acknowledged was true enough--but that, as they said, was none
of their business; that if the Czar expected to convert his Siberian,
Tonguse, or Tartar subjects, it should be done by sending clergymen among
them, not soldiers; and they added, with more sincerity than I expected,
that it was not so much the concern of their monarch to make the people
Christians as to make them subjects.

From this river to the Oby we crossed a wild uncultivated country, barren
of people and good management, otherwise it is in itself a pleasant,
fruitful, and agreeable country.  What inhabitants we found in it are all
pagans, except such as are sent among them from Russia; for this is the
country--I mean on both sides the river Oby--whither the Muscovite
criminals that are not put to death are banished, and from whence it is
next to impossible they should ever get away.  I have nothing material to
say of my particular affairs till I came to Tobolski, the capital city of
Siberia, where I continued some time on the following account.

We had now been almost seven months on our journey, and winter began to
come on apace; whereupon my partner and I called a council about our
particular affairs, in which we found it proper, as we were bound for
England, to consider how to dispose of ourselves.  They told us of
sledges and reindeer to carry us over the snow in the winter time, by
which means, indeed, the Russians travel more in winter than they can in
summer, as in these sledges they are able to run night and day: the snow,
being frozen, is one universal covering to nature, by which the hills,
vales, rivers, and lakes are all smooth and hard is a stone, and they run
upon the surface, without any regard to what is underneath.

But I had no occasion to urge a winter journey of this kind.  I was bound
to England, not to Moscow, and my route lay two ways: either I must go on
as the caravan went, till I came to Jarislaw, and then go off west for
Narva and the Gulf of Finland, and so on to Dantzic, where I might
possibly sell my China cargo to good advantage; or I must leave the
caravan at a little town on the Dwina, from whence I had but six days by
water to Archangel, and from thence might be sure of shipping either to
England, Holland, or Hamburg.

Now, to go any one of these journeys in the winter would have been
preposterous; for as to Dantzic, the Baltic would have been frozen up and
I could not get passage; and to go by land in those countries was far
less safe than among the Mogul Tartars; likewise, as to Archangel in
October, all the ships would be gone from thence, and even the merchants
who dwr Fright was over,
yet she made no Answer, least he should find her out, if she spoke,
therefore she resolved to counterfeit Sleep, and take what followed.

The Husband came to Bed, and that Night play'd the vigorous Lover; but one
Thing spoil'd the Diversion on the Wife's Side, which was, the Reflection
that it was not design'd for her; however she was very passive, and bore it
like a Christian. Early before Day, she stole out of Bed, leaving him
asleep, and went to her Mother in Law, telling her what had passed, not
forgetting how he had used her, as taking her for the Maid; the Husband
also stole out, not thinking it convenient to be catch'd in that Room; in
the mean Time, the Revenge of the Mistress was strongly against the Maid,
and without considering, that to her she ow'd the Diversion of the Night
before, and that one good _Turn_ should deserve another; she sent for a
Constable, and charged her with stealing the Spoons: The Maid's Trunk was
broke open, and the Spoons found, upon which she was carried before a
Justice of Peace, and by him committed to Goal.

The Husband loiter'd about till twelve a Clock at Noon, then comes Home,
pretended he was just come to Town; as soon as he heard what had passed, in
Relation to the Maid, he fell into a great Passion with his Wife; this set
the Thing into a greater Flame, the Mother takes the Wife's Part against
her own Son, insomuch that the Quarrel increasing, the Mother and Wife took
Horse immediately, and went back to the Mother's House, and the Husband and
Wife never bedded together after.

The Maid lay a long Time in the Prison, it being near half a Year to the
Assizes; but before it happened, it was discovered she was with Child; when
she was arraign'd at the Bar, she was discharged for want of Evidence; the
Wife's Conscience touch'd her, and as she did not believe the Maid Guilty
of any Theft, except that of Love, she did not appear against her; soon
after her Acquittal, she was delivered of a Girl.

But what alarm'd the Husband most, was, that it was discovered the Wife was
with Child also, he taking it for granted, he had had no Intimacy with her,
since her last lying in, grew jealous of her, in his Turn, and made this a
Handle to justify himself, for his Usage of her, pretending now he had
suspected her long, but that here was Proof; she was delivered of Twins, a
Boy and a Girl.

The Mother fell ill, sent to her Son to reconcile him to his Wife, but he
would not hearken to it; therefore she made a Will, leaving all she had in
the Hands of certain Trustees, for the Use of the Wife and two Children
lately born, and died a few Days after.

This was an ugly Turn upon him, his greatest Dependence being upon his
Mother; however, his Wife was kinder to him than he deserved, for she made
him a yearly Allowance out of what was left, tho' they continued to live
separate: It lasted near five Years; at this Time having a great Affection
for the Girl he had by his Maid, he had a Mind to take it Home, to live
with him; but as all the Town knew it to be a Girl, the better to disguise
the Matter from them, as well as from his Wife, he had it put into
Breeches, as a Boy, pretending it was a Relation's Child he was to breed up
to be his Clerk.

The Wife heard he had a little Boy at Home he was very fond of, but as she
did not know any Relation of his that had such a Child, she employ'd a
Friend to enquire further into it; this Person by talking with the Child,
found it to be a Girl, discovered that the Servant-Maid was its Mother, and
that the Husband still kept up his Correspondence with her.

Upon this Intelligence, the Wife being unwilling that her Children's Money
should go towards the Maintenance of Bastards, stopped the Allowance: The
Husband enraged, in a kind of Revenge, takes the Maid home, and lives with
her publickly, to the great Scandal of his Neighbours; but he soon found
the bad Effect of it, for by Degrees lost his Practice, so that he saw
plainly he could not live there, therefore he thought of removing, and
turning what Effects he had into ready Money; he goes to _Cork_, and there
with his Maid and Daughter embarques for _Carolina_.

At first he followed the Practice of the Law in that Province, but
afterwards fell into Merchandize, which proved more successful to him, for
he gained by it sufficient to purchase a considerable Plantation: His Maid,
who passed for his Wife, happened to dye, after which his Daughter, our
_Anne Bonny_, now grown up, kept his House.

She was of a fierce and couragious Temper, wherefore, when she lay under
Condemnation, several Stories were reported of her, much to her
Disadvantage, as that she had kill'd an _English_ Servant-Maid once in her
Passion with a Case-Knife, while she look'd after her Father's House; but
upon further Enquiry, I found this Story to be groundless: It was certain
she was so robust, that once, when a young Fellow would have lain with her,
against her Will, she beat him so, that he lay ill of it a considerable
Time.

While she lived with her Father, she was look'd upon as one that would be a
good Fortune, wherefore it was thought her Father expected a good Match for
her; but she spoilt all, for without his Consent, she marries a young
Fellow, who belonged to the Sea, and was not worth a Groat; which provoked
her Father to such a Degree, that he turned her out of Doors, upon which
the young Fellow, who married her, finding himself disappointed in his
Expectation, shipped himself and Wife, for the Island of _Providence_,
expecting Employment there.

Here she became acquainted with _Rackam_ the Pyrate, who making Courtship
to her, soon found Means of withdrawing her Affections from her Husband, so
that she consented to elope from him, and go to Sea with _Rackam_ in Men's
Cloaths: She was as good as her Word, and after she had been at Sea some
Time, she proved with Child, and beginning to grow big, _Rackam_ landed her
on the Island of _Cuba_; and recommending her there to some Friends of his,
they took Care of her, till she was brought to Bed: When she was up and
well again, he sent for her to bear him Company.

The King's Proclamation being out, for pardoning of Pyrates, he took the
Benefit of it, and surrendered; afterwards being sent upon the privateering
Account, he returned to his old Trade, as has been already hinted in the
Story of _Mary Read_. In all these Expeditions, _Anne Bonny_ bore him
Company, and when any Business was to be done in their Way, no Body was
more forward or couragious than she, and particularly when they were taken;
she and _Mary Read_, with one more, were all the Persons that durst keep
the Deck, as has been before hinted.

Her Father was known to a great many Gentlemen, Planters of _Jamaica_, who
had dealt with him, and among whom he had a good Reputation; and some of
them, who had been in _Carolina_, remember'd to have seen her in his House;
wherefore they were inclined to shew her Favour, but the Action of leaving
her Husband was an ugly Circumstance against her. The Day that _Rackam_ was
executed, by special Favour, he was admitted to see her; but all the
Comfort she gave him, was, _that she was sorry to see him there, but if he
had fought like a Man, he need not have been hang'd like a Dog_.

She was continued in Prison, to the Time of her lying in, and afterwards
reprieved from Time to Time; but what is become of her since, we cannot
tell; only this we know, that she was not executed.

CHAP. VIII. OF Captain _Howel Davis_, And his CREW.

CAptain _Howel Davis_ was born at _Milford_, in _Monmouthshire_, and
was from a Boy brought up to the Sea. The last Voyage he made from
_England_, was in the _Cadogan_ Snow of _Bristol_, Captain _Skinner_
Commander, bound for the Coast of _Guiney_, of which Snow _Davis_ was chief
Mate: They were no sooner arrived at _Sierraleon_ on the aforesaid Coast,
but they were taken by the Pyrate _England_, who plunder'd them, and
_Skinner_ was barbarously murdered, as has been related before in the Story
of Captain _England_.

After the Death of Captain _Skinner, Davis_ pretended that he was mightily
sollicited by _England_ to engage with him; but that he resolutely
answered, he would sooner be shot to Death than sign the Pyrates Articles.
Upon which, _England_, pleased with his Bravery, sent him and the rest of
the Men again on Board the Snow, appointing him Captain of her, in the Room
of _Skinner_, commanding him to pursue his Voyage. He also gave him a
written Paper sealed up, with Orders to open it when he should come into a
certain Latitude, and at the Peril of his Life follow the Orders therein
set down. This was an Air of Grandeur like what Princes practice to their
Admirals and Generals.--It was punctually complied with by _Davis_, who
read it to the Ship's Company; it contained no less than a generous Deed of
Gift of the Ship and Cargoe, to _Davis_ and the Crew, ordering him to go to
_Brasil_ and dispose of the Lading to the best Advantage, and to make a
fair and equal Dividend with the rest.

_Davis_ proposed to the Crew, whether they were willing to follow their
Directions, but to his great Surprize, found the Majority of them
altogether averse to it, wherefore in a Rage, he bad them be damn'd, and go
where they would. They knew that Part of their Cargoe was consigned to
certain Merchants at _Barbadoes_, wherefore they steered for that Island.
When they arrived, they related to these Merchants the unfortunate Death of
_Skinner_, and the Proposal which had been made to them by _Davis_; upon
which _Davis_ was seized and committed to Prison, where he was kept three
Months; however, as he had been in no Act of Pyracy, he was discharged
without being brought to any Tryal, yet he could not expect any Employment
there; wherefore knowing that the Island of _Providence_ was a kind of
Rendevouz of Pyrates, he was resolved to make one amongst them, if
possible, and to that Purpose, found Means of shipping himself for that
Island; but he was again disappointed, for when he arrived there, the
Pyrates had newly surrendered to Captain _Woods Rogers_, and accepted of
the Act of Grace, which he had just brought from _England_.

However, _Davis_ was not long out of Business, for Captain _Rogers_ having
fitted out two Sloops for Trade, one called the _Buck_, the other the
_Mumvil Trader; Davis_ found an Employment on Board of one of them; the
Lading of these Sloops was of considerable Value, consisting of _European_
Goods, in order to be exchanged with the _French_ and _Spaniards_; and many
of the Hands on Board of them, were the Pyrates lately come in upon the
late Act of Grace. The first Place they touched at, was the Island of
_Martinico_, belonging to the _French_, where _Davis_ having conspired with
some others, rise in the Night, secured the Master and seized the Sloop; as
soon as this was done, they called to the other Sloop, which lay a little
Way from them, among whom they knew there were a great many Hands ripe for
Rebellion, and ordered them to come on Board of them; they did so, and the
greatest Part of them agreed to join with _Davis_; those who were otherwise
inclined, were sent back on Board the _Mumvil_ Sloop, to go where they
pleased, _Davis_ having first taken out of her, every Thing which he
thought might be of Use.

After this, a Counsel of War was called over a large Bowl of Punch, at
which it was proposed to chuse a Commander; the Election was soon over, for
it fell upon _Davis_ by a great Majority of _legal Pollers_, there was no
Scrutiny demanded, for all acquiesced in the Choice: As soon as he was
possess'd of his Command, he drew up Articles, which were signed and sworn
to by himself and the rest, then he made a short Speech, the sum of which,
was, a Declaration of War against the whole World.

After this they consulted about a proper Place where they might clean their
Sloop, a light Pair of Heels being of great Use either to take, or escape
being taken; for this purpose they made Choice of _Coxon_'s _Hole_, at the
East End of the Island of _Cuba_, a Place where they might secure
themselves from Surprize, the Entrance being so narrow, that one Ship might
keep out a hundred.

Here they cleaned with much Difficulty, for they had no Carpenter in their
Company, a Person of great Use upon such Exigencies; from hence they put to
Sea, making to the North-Side of the Island of _Hispaniola_. The first Sail
which fell in their Way, was a _French_ Ship of twelve Guns; it must be
observed, that _Davis_ had but thirty five Hands, yet Provisions began to
grow short with him; wherefore he attacked this Ship, she soon struck, and
he sent twelve of his Hands on Board of her, in order to plunder: This was
no sooner done, but a Sail was spied a great Way to Windward of them; they
enquired of the _French_ Man what she might be, he answered, that he had
spoke with a Ship, the Day before, of 24 Guns and 60 Men, and he took this
to be the same.

_Davis_ then proposed to his Men to attack her, telling them, she would be
a rare Ship for their Use, but they looked upon it to be an extravagant
Attempt, and discovered no Fondness for it, but he assured them he had a
Stratagem in his Head would make all safe; wherefore he gave Chace, and
ordered his Prize to do the same. The Prize being a slow Sailor, _Davis_
first came up with the Enemy, and standing along Side of them, shewed his
pyratical Colours: They, much surpriz'd, called to _Davis_, telling him,
they wondered at his Impudence in venturing to come so near them, and
ordered him to strike; but he answered, that he intended to keep them in
Play, till his Consort came up, who was able to deal with them, and that if
they did not strike to him, they should have but bad Quarters; whereupon he
gave them a Broad-Side, which they returned.

In the mean Time the Prize drew near, who obliged all the Prisoners to come
upon Deck in white Shirts, to make a Shew of Force, as they had been
directed by _Davis_; they also hoisted a dirty Tarpawlin, by Way of black
Flag, they having no other, and fir'd a Gun: The _French_ Men were so
intimidated by this Appearance of Force, that they struck. _Davis_ called
out to the Captain to come on Board of him, with twenty of his Hands; he
did so, and they were all for the greater Security clapt into Irons, the
Captain excepted: Then he sent four of his own Men on Board the first
Prize, and in order still to carry on the Cheat, spoke aloud, that they
should give his Service to the Captain, and desire him to send some Hands
on Board the Prize, to see what they had got; but at the same Time gave
them a written Paper, with Instructions what to do. Here he ordered them to
nail up the Guns in the little Prize, to take out all the small Arms and
Powder, and to go every Man of them on Board the second Prize; when this
was done, he ordered that more of the Prisoners should be removed out of
the great Prize, into the little one, by which he secured himself from any
Attempt which might be feared from their Numbers; for those on Board of him
were fast in Irons, and those in the little Prize had neither Arms nor
Ammunition.

Thus the three Ships kept Company for 2 Days, when finding the great Prize
to be a very dull Sailor, he thought she would not be fit for his Purpose,
wherefore he resolved to restore her to the Captain, with all his Hands;
but first, he took Care to take out all her Ammunition, and every Thing
else which he might possibly want. The _French_ Captain was in such a Rage,
at being so outwitted, that when he got on Board his own Ship, he was going
to throw himself over-board, but was prevented by his Men.

Having let go both his Prizes, he steered Northward, in which Course he
took a small _Spanish_ Sloop; after this, he made towards the _Western_
Islands, but met with no Booty thereabouts; then he steered for the _Cape
de Verde_ Islands, they cast Anchor at St. _Nicholas_, hoisting _English_
Colours; the _Portuguese_ inhabiting there, took him for an _English_
Privateer, and _Davis_ going ashore, they both treated him very civilly,
and also traded with him. Here he remained five Weeks, in which Time, he
and half his Crew, for their Pleasure, took a Journey to the chief Town of
the Island, which was 19 Miles up the Country: _Davis_ making a good
Appearance, was caressed by the Governor and the Inhabitants, and no
Diversion was wanting which the _Portuguese_ could shew, or Money could
purchase; after about a Week's Stay, he came back to the Ship, and the rest
of the Crew went to take their Pleasure up to the Town, in their Turn.

At their Return they clean'd their Ship, and put to Sea, but not with their
whole Company; for five of them, like _Hannibal_'s Men, were so charm'd
with the Luxuries of the Place, and the free Conversation of some Women,
that they staid behind; and one of them, whose Name was _Charles Franklin_,
a _Monmouthshire_ Man, married and settled himself, and lives there to this
Day.

From hence they sailed to _Bonevista_, and looked into that Harbour, but
finding nothing, they steer'd for the Isle of _May_: When they arrived
here, they met with a great many Ships and Vessels in the Road, all which
they plundered, taking out of them whatever they wanted; and also
strengthen'd themselves with a great many fresh Hands, who most of them
enter'd voluntarily. One of the Ships they took to their own Use, mounted
her with twenty six Guns, and call'd her the _King James_. There being no
fresh Water hereabouts, they made towards St. _Jago_, belonging to the
_Portuguese_, in order to lay in a Store; _Davis_, with a few Hands, going
ashore to find the most commodious Place to water at, the Governor, with
some Attendants, came himself and examined who they were, and whence they
came? And not liking _Davis_'s Account of himself, the Governor was so
plain to tell them, he suspected them to be Pyrates. _Davis_ seemed
mightily affronted, standing much upon his Honour, replying to the
Governor, he scorn'd his Words; however, as soon as his Back was turn'd,
for fear of Accidents, he got on Board again as fast as he could. _Davis_
related what had happened, and his Men seemed to resent the Affront which
had been offered him. _Davis_, upon this, told them, he was confident he
could surprize the Fort in the Night; they agreed with him to attempt it,
and accordingly, when it grew late, they went ashore well arm'd; and the
Guard which was kept, was so negligent, that they got within the Fort
before any Alarm was given: When it was too late there was some little
Resistance made, and three Men killed on _Davis_'s Side. Those in the Fort,
in their Hurry, run into the Governor's House to save themselves, which
they barricadoed so strongly, that _Davis_'s Party could not enter it;
however, they threw in Granadoe-Shells, which not only ruin'd all the
Furniture, but kill'd several Men within.

When it was Day the whole Country was alarm'd, and came to attack the
Pyrates; wherefore it not being their Business to stand a Siege, they made
the best of their Way on Board their Ship again, after having dismounted
the Guns of the Fort. By this Enterprize they did a great Deal of Mischief
to the _Portuguese_, and but very little Good to themselves.

Having put to Sea they muster'd their Hands, and found themselves near
seventy strong; then it was proposed what Course they should steer, and
differing in their Opinions, they divided, and by a Majority it was carried
for _Gambia_ on the Coast of _Guiney_; of this Opinion was _Davis_, he
having been employ'd in that Trade, was acquainted with the Coast: He told
them, that there was a great deal of Money always kept in _Gambia_ Castle,
and that it would be worth their while to make an Attempt upon it. They
ask'd him how it was possible, since it was garrisoned? He desired they
would leave the Management of it to him, and he would undertake to make
them Masters of it. They began now to conceive so high an Opinion of his
Conduct, as well as Courage, that they thought nothing impossible to him,
therefore they agreed to obey him, without enquiring further into his
Design.

Having come within Sight of the Place, he ordered all his Men under Deck,
except as many as were absolutely necessary for working the Ship, that
those from the Fort seeing a Ship with so few Hands, might have no
Suspicion of her being any other than a trading Vessel; then he ran close
under the Fort, and there cast Anchor; and having ordered out the Boat, he
commanded six Men in her, in old ordinary Jackets, while he himself, with
the Master and Doctor, dressed themselves like Gentlemen; his Design being,
that the Men should look like common Sailors, and they like Merchants. In
rowing ashore he gave his Men Instructions what to say in Case any
Questions should be asked them.

Being come to the landing Place, he was received by a File of Musqueteers,
and conducted into the Fort, where the Governor accosting them civilly,
ask'd them who they were, and whence they came? They answered they were of
_Liverpool_, bound for the River of _Sinnegal_, to trade for Gum and
Elephants Teeth, but that they were chaced on that Coast by two _French_
Men of War, and narrowly escaped being taken, having a little the Heels of
them; but now they were resolved to make the best of a bad Market, and
would Trade here for Slaves; then the Governor ask'd them, what was the
chief of their Cargo? They answered, Iron and Plate, which were good Things
there; the Governor told them he would Slave them to the full Value of
their Cargoe, and asked them, if they had any _European_ Liquor on Board?
they answered, a little for their own Use; however, a Hamper should be at
his Service. The Governor then very civilly invited them all to stay and
dine with him; _Davis_ told him, that being Commander of the Ship, he must
go on Board to see her well moored, and give some other Orders, but those
two Gentlemen might stay, and that he himself would also return before
Dinner, and bring the Hamper of Liquor with him.

While he was in the Fort, his Eyes were very busy in observing how Things
lay; he took Notice there was a Centry at the Entrance, and a Guard-House
just by it, where the Soldiers upon Duty commonly waited, their Arms
standing in a Corner, in a Heap; he saw also a great many small Arms in the
Governor's Hall; now when he came on Board, he assured his Men of Success,
desiring them not to get drunk, and that as soon as they saw the Flag upon
the Castle struck, they might conclude he was Master, and send twenty Hands
immediately ashore; in the mean Time, there being a Sloop at Anchor near
them, he sent some Hands in a Boat, to secure the Master and all the Men,
and bring them on Board of him, least they observing any Bustle or arming
in his Ship, might send ashore and give Intelligence.

These Precautions being taken, he ordered his Men, who were to go in the
Boat with him, to put two Pair of Pistols each under their Cloaths, he
doing the like himself, and gave them Directions to go into the Guard-Room,
and to enter into Conversation with the Soldiers, and observe when he
should fire a Pistol thro' the Governor's Window, to start up at once and
secure the Arms in the Guard-Room.

When _Davis_ arrived, Dinner not being ready, the Governor proposed that
they should pass their Time in making a Bowl of Punch till Dinner-Time: It
must be observed, that _Davis_'s Coxen waited upon them, who had an
Opportunity of going about all Parts of the House, to see what Strength
they had, he whispered _Davis_, there being no Person then in the Room, but
he, _(Davis)_ the Master, the Doctor, the Coxen and Governor; _Davis_ on a
sudden drew out a Pistol, clapt it to the Governor's Breast, telling him,
he must surrender the Fort and all the Riches in it, or he was a dead Man.
The Governor being no Ways prepared for such an Attack, promised to be very
Passive, and do all they desired, therefore they shut the Door, took down
all the Arms that hung in the Hall, and loaded them. _Davis_ fires his
Pistol thro' the Window, upon which his Men, without, executed their Part
of the Scheme, like Heroes, in an Instant; getting betwixt the Soldiers and
their Arms, all with their Pistols cock'd in their Hands, while one of them
carried the Arms out. When this was done, they locked the Soldiers into the
Guard-Room, and kept Guard without.

In the mean Time one of them struck the Union Flag on the Top of the
Castle, at which Signal those on Board sent on Shore a Reinforcement of
Hands, and they got Possession of the Fort without the least Hurry or
Confusion, or so much as a Man lost of either Side.

_Davis_ harangued the Soldiers, upon which a great many of them took on
with him, those who refused, he sent on Board the little Sloop, and because
he would not be at the Trouble of a Guard for them, he ordered all the
Sails and Cables out of her, which might hinder them from attempting to get
away.

This Day was spent in a kind of Rejoycing, the Castle firing her Guns to
salute the Ship, and the Ship the Castle; but the next Day they minded
their Business, that is, they fell to plundering, but they found Things
fall vastly short of their Expectation; for they discovered, that a great
deal of Money had been lately sent away; however, they met with the Value
of about two thousand Pounds Sterling in Bar Gold, and a great many other
rich Effects: Every Thing they liked, which was portable, they brought
aboard their Ship; some Things which they had no Use for, they were so
generous to make a Present of, to the Master and Crew of the little Sloop,
to whom they also returned his Vessel again, and then they fell to work in
dismounting the Guns, and demolishing the Fortifications.

After they had done as much Mischief as they could, and were weighing
Anchor to be gone, they spy'd a Ship bearing down upon them in full Sail;
they soon got their Anchor's up, and were in a Readiness to receive her.
This Ship prov'd to be a _French_ Pyrate of fourteen Guns and sixty four
Hands, half _French_, half Negroes; the Captain's Name was _La Bouse_; he
expected no less than a rich Prize, which made him so eager in the Chace;
but when he came near enough to see their Guns, and the Number of their
Hands upon Deck, he began to think he should catch a _Tartar_, and supposed
her to be a small _English_ Man of War; however, since there was no
escaping, he resolved to do a bold and desperate Action, which was to board
_Davis_. As he was making towards her, for this Purpose, he fired a Gun,
and hoisted his black Colours; _Davis_ returned the Salute, and hoisted his
black Colours also. The _French_ Man was not a little pleased at this happy
Mistake; they both hoisted out their Boats, and the Captains went to meet
and congratulate one another with a Flag of Truce in their Sterns; a great
many Civilities passed between them, and _La Bouse_ desired _Davis_, that
they might sail down the Coast together, that he _(La Bouse)_ might get a
better Ship: _Davis_ agreed to it, and very courteously promised him the
first Ship he took, fit for his Use, he would give him, as being willing to
encourage a willing Brother.

The first Place they touch'd at, was _Sierraleon_, where at first going in,
they spied a tall Ship at Anchor; _Davis_ being the best Sailor first came
up with her, and wondering that she did not try to make off, suspected her
to be a Ship of Force. As soon as he came along Side of her, she brought a
Spring upon her Cable, and fired a whole Broadside upon _Davis_, at the
same Time hoisted a black Flag; _Davis_ hoisted his black Flag in like
Manner, and fired one Gun to Leeward.

In fine, she proved to be a Pyrate Ship of twenty four Guns, commanded by
one _Cocklyn_, who expecting these two would prove Prizes, let them come
in, least his getting under Sail might frighten them away.

This Satisfaction was great on all Sides, at this Junction of Confederates
and Brethren in Iniquity; two Days they spent in improving their
Acquaintance and Friendship, the third Day _Davis_ and _Cocklyn_, agreed to
go in _La Bouse_'s Brigantine and attack the Fort; they contrived it so, as
to get up thither by high Water; those in the Fort suspected them to be
what they really were, and therefore stood upon their Defence; when the
Brigantine came within Musket-Shot, the Fort fired all their Guns upon her,
the Brigantine did the like upon the Fort, and so held each other in Play
for several Hours, when the two confederate Ships were come up to the
Assistance of the Brigantine; those who defended the Fort, seeing such a
Number of Hands on Board these Ships, had not the Courage to stand it any
longer, but abandoning the Fort, left it to the Mercy of the Pyrates.

They took Possession of it, and continued there near seven Weeks, in which
Time they all cleaned their Ships. We should have observed, that a Galley
came into the Road while they were there, which _Davis_ insisted should be
yielded to _La Bouse_, according to his Word of Honour before given;
_Cocklyn_ did not oppose it, so _La Bouse_ went into her, with his Crew,
and cutting away her half Deck, mounted her with twenty four Guns.

Having called a Counsel of War, they agreed to sail down the Coast
together, and for the greater Grandeur, appointed a Commadore, which was
_Davis_; but they had not kept Company long, when drinking together on
Board of _Davis_, they had like to have fallen together by the Ears, the
strong Liquor stirring up a Spirit of Discord among them, and they
quarrelled, but _Davis_ put an End to it, by this short Speech:--_Heark ye,
you_ Cocklin _and_ La Bouse, _I find by strengthening you, I have put a Rod
into your Hands to whip my self, but I'm still able to deal with you both;
but since we met in Love, let us part in Love, for I find, that three of a
Trade can never agree_.--Upon which the other two went on Board their
respective Ships, and immediately parted, each steering a different Course.

_Davis_ held on his Way down the Coast, and making Cape _Appollonia_, he
met with two _Scotch_ and one _English_ Vessel, which he plundered, and
then let go. About five Days after he fell in with a _Dutch_ Interloper of
thirty Guns and ninety Men, (half being _English_,) off Cape _Three Points_
Bay; _Davis_ coming up along Side of her, the _Dutch_ Man gave the first
Fire, and pouring in a broad-Side upon _Davis_, killed nine of his Men,
_Davis_ returned it, and a very hot Engagement followed, which lasted from
one a Clock at Noon, till nine next Morning, when the _Dutch_ Man struck,
and yielded her self their Prize.

_Davis_ fitted up the _Dutch_ Ship for his own Use, and called her the
_Rover_, aboard of which he mounted thirty two Guns, and twenty seven
Swivels, and proceeded with her and the _King James_, to _Anamaboe_; he
entered the Bay betwixt the Hours of twelve and one at Noon, and found
there three Ships lying at Anchor, who were trading for Negroes, Gold and
Teeth: The Names of these Ships were the _Hink_ Pink, Captain _Hall_
Commander, the _Princess_, Captain _Plumb_, of which _Roberts_, who will
make a considerable Figure in the sequel of this History, was second Mate,
and the _Morrice_ Sloop, Captain _Fin_; he takes these Ships without any
Resistance, and having plundered them, he makes a Present of one of them,
_viz._ the _Morrice_ Sloop, to the _Dutch_ Men, on Board of which alone
were found a hundred and forty Negroes, besides dry Goods, and a
considerable Quantity of Gold-Dust.

It happened there were several Canoes along Side of this last, when _Davis_
came in, who saved themselves and got ashore; these gave Notice at the
Fort, that these Ships were Pyrates, upon which the Fort fired upon them,
but without any Execution, for their Mettle was not of Weight enough to
reach them; _Davis_ therefore, by Way of Defiance, hoisted his black Flag
and returned their Compliment.

The same Day he sail'd with his three Ships, making his Way down the Coast
towards _Princes_, a _Portuguese_ Colony: But, before we proceed any
farther in _Davis_'s Story, we shall give our Reader an Account of the
_Portuguese_ Settlements on this Coast, with other curious Remarks, as they
were communicated to me by an ingenious Gentleman, lately arrived from
those Parts.

_A Description of the Islands of_ St. THOME, DEL PRINCIPE, _and_
ANNOBONO.

AS the _Portuguese_ were the great Improvers of Navigation, and the
first _Europeans_ who traded too and settled on the Coasts of _Africa_,
even round to _India_, and made those Discoveries, which now turn so much
to the Advantage of other Nations, it may not be amiss, previously to a
Description of those Islands, to hint on that wonderful Property of the
Loadstone, that a little before had been found out, and enabled them to
pursue such new and daring Navigations.

The attractive Power of the Loadstone, was universally known with the
Ancients, as may be believed by its being a native Fossil of the
_Grecians_, (_Magnes a Magnesia_) but its directive, or polar Virtue, has
only been known to us within this 350 Years, and said to be found out by
_John Goia_ of _Malphi_, in the Kingdom of _Naples, Prima dedit nautis usum
magnetis Amalphi_; tho' others think, and assure us, it was transported by
_Paulus Venetus_ from _China_ to _Italy_, like the other famous Arts of
modern Use with us, PRINTING and _the Use of_ GUNS.

The other Properties of Improvements of the Magnet, _viz._ Variation, or
its Defluction from an exact N. or S. Line, Variation of that Variation,
and its Inclination, were the Inventions of _Sebastian Cabot_, Mr.
_Gellibrand_, and Mr. _Norman_; the Inclination of the Needle, or that
Property whereby it keeps an Elevation above the Horizon, in all Places but
under the Equator, (where its Parallel) is as surprizing a Phænomenon as
any, and was the Discovery of our Countrymen; and could it be found
regular, I imagine would very much help towards the Discovery of Longitude,
at least would point out better Methods than hitherto known, when Ships
drew nigh Land, which would answer as useful an End.

Before the Verticity and Use of the Compass, the _Portuguese_ Navigations
had extended no farther than Cape _Non_, (it was their _ne plus ultra_,)
and therefore so called; distress of Weather, indeed, had drove some
Coasters to _Porto Santo_, and _Madera_, before any certain Method of
steering was invented; but after the Needle was seen thus inspired,
Navigation every Year improved under the great Incouragements of _Henry,
Alphonsus_, and _John_ II. Kings of _Portugal_, in Part of the 14th and in
the 15th Century.

King _Alphonsus_ was not so much at leasure as his Predecessor, to pursue
these Discoveries, but having seen the Advantages accrued to _Portugal_ by
them, and that the Pope had confirmed the perpetual Donation of all they
should discover between Cape _Bajadore_ and _India_, inclusively, he
resolved not to neglect the proper Assistance, and farmed the Profits that
did or might ensue to one _Bernard Gomez_, a Citizen of _Lisbon_, who was
every Voyage obliged to discover 100 Leagues, still farther on: And about
the Year 1470 made these Islands, the only Places (of all the considerable
and large Colonies they had in _Africa_,) that do now remain to that Crown.

St. _Thome_ is the principal of the three, whose Governour is stiled
Captain General of the Islands, and from whom the other at _Princes_
receives his Commission, tho' nominated by the Court of _Portugal_: It is a
Bishoprick with a great many secular Clergy who appear to have neither
Learning nor Devotion, as may be judged by several of them being Negroes:
One of the Chief of them, invited us to hear Mass, as a Diversion to pass
Time away, where he, and his inferior Brethren acted such affected Gestures
and Strains of Voice, as shewed to their Dishonour, they had no other Aim
than pleasing us; and what I think was still worse, it was not without a
View of Interest; for as these Clergy are the chief Traders, they stoop to
pitiful and scandalous Methods for ingratiating themselves: They and the
Government, on this trading Account, maintain as great Harmony, being ever
jealous of each other, and practising little deceitful Arts to monopolize
what Strangers have to offer for sale, whether Toys or Cloaths, which of
all Sorts are ever Commodious with the _Portuguese_, in all Parts of the
World; an ordinary Suit of Black will sell for seven or eight Pound; a
Turnstile Wig of four Shillings, for a Moidore; a Watch of forty Shillings,
for six Pound, _&c_.

The Town is of mean Building, but large and populous, the Residence of the
greater Part of the Natives, who, thro' the whole Island, are computed at
10000, the Militia at 3000, and are in general, a rascally thievish
Generation, as an old grave Friend of mine can Witness; for he having
carried a Bag of second hand Cloaths on Shore, to truck for Provisions,
seated himself on the Sand for that Purpose, presently gathered a Crowd
round him, to view them; one of which desired to know the Price of a black
Suit, that unluckily lay uppermost, and was the best of them, agreeing to
the Demand, with little Hesitation, provided it would but fit him; he put
them on immediately, in as much hurry as possible, without any _co-licentia
Seignor_; and when my Friend was about to commend the Goodness of the Suit,
and Exactness they set with, not dreaming of the Impudence of running away
from a Crowd, the Rascal took to his Heels, my Friend followed and bawled
very much, and tho' there was 500 People about the Place, it served to no
other End but making him a clear Stage, that the best Pair of Heels might
carry it; so he lost the Suit of Cloaths, and before he could return to his
Bag, others of them had beat off his Servant, and shared the rest.

Most of the Ships from _Guiney_, of their own Nation, and frequently those
of ours, call at one or other of these Islands, to recruit with fresh
Provisions, and take in Water, which on the Coast are not so good, nor so
conveniently to come by: Their own Ships likewise, when they touch here,
are obliged to leave the King his Custom for their Slaves, which is always
in Gold, at so much a Head, without any Deduction at _Brasil_, for the
Mortality that may happen afterwards; this by being a constant Bank to pay
off the civil and military Charges of the Government, prevents the
Inconveniency of Remittances, and keeps both it and _Princes_ Isle rich
enough to pay ready Money for every Thing they want of _Europeans_.

Their Beefs are small and lean, (two hundred Weight or a little more,) but
the Goats, Hogs and Fowls very good, their Sugar course and dirty, and Rum
very ordinary; as these Refreshments lay most with People who are in want
of other Necessaries, they come to us in Way of bartering, very cheap: A
good Hog for an old Cutlash; a fat Fowl for a Span of _Brasil_ Tobacco, (no
other Sort being valued, _&c_.) But with Money you give eight Dollars _per_
Head for Cattle; three Dollars for a Goat; six Dollars for a grown Hog; a
Testune and a Half for a Fowl; a Dollar _per_ Gallon for Rum; two Dollars a
Roove for Sugar; and half a Dollar for a Dozen of Paraquets: Here is Plenty
likewise of Corn and Farine, of Limes, Citrons and Yamms.

The Island is reckoned nigh a Square, each Side 18 Leagues long, hilly, and
lays under the _Æquinoctial_, a wooden Bridge just without the Town, being
said not to deviate the least Part of a Minute, either to the Southward or
Northward; and notwithstanding this warm Scituation, and continual vertical
Suns, the Islanders are very healthy, imputed by those who are disposed to
be merry, in a great Measure to the Want of even so much as one Surgeon or
Physician amongst them.

Isle _Del Principe_, the next in Magnitude, a pleasant and delightful Spot
to the grave, and thoughtfull Disposition of the _Portuguese_, an
Improvement of Country Retirement, in that, this may be a happy and
uninterrupted Retreat from the whole World.

I shall divide what I have to say on this Island, into Observations made on
our Approach to it, on the Seas round it, the Harbour, Produce of the
Island and Seasons, Way of Living among the Inhabitants, some Custom of the
Negroes, with such proper Deductions on each as may illustrate the
Description, and inform the Reader.

We were bound hither from _Whydah_, at the latter Part of the Month _July_,
when the Rains are over, and the Winds hang altogether S. W. (as they do
before the Rains, S. E.) yet with this Wind (when at Sea) we found the Ship
gained unexpectedly so far to the Southward, (_i. e._ Windward,) that we
could with ease have weathered any of the Islands, and this seems next to
impossible should be, if the Currents, which were strong to Leeward, in the
Road of _Whydah_, had extended in like Manner cross the Bite of _Benin_:
No, it must then have been very difficult to have weathered even Cape
_Formosa_: On this Occasion, I shall farther expatiate upon the Currents on
the whole Coast of _Guiney_.

The Southern Coast of _Africa_ runs in a Line of Latitude, the Northern on
an Eastern Line, but both strait, with the fewest Inlets, Gulphs or Bays,
of either of the four Continents; the only large and remarkable one, is
that of _Benin_ and _Calabar_, towards which the Currents of each Coast
tend, and is strongest from the Southward, because more open to a larger
Sea, whose rising it is (tho' little and indiscernable at any Distance from
the Land,) that gives rise to these Currents close in Shore, which are
nothing but Tides altered and disturbed by the Make and Shape of Lands.

For Proof of this, I shall lay down the following Observations as certain
Facts. That in the Rivers of _Gambia_ and _Sierraleon_, in the Straits and
Channels of _Benin_, and in general along the whole Coast, the Flowings are
regular on the Shores, with this Difference; that, in the abovemention'd
Rivers, and in the Channels of _Benin_, where the Shore contract the Waters
into a narrow Compass, the Tides are strong and high, as well as regular;
but on the dead Coast, where it makes an equal Reverberation, slow and low,
(not to above two or three Foot,) increasing as you advance towards
_Benin_; and this is farther evident in that at Cape _Corso, Succonda_ and
_Commenda_, and where the Land rounds and gives any Stop, the Tides flow
regularly to four Foot and upwards; when on an evener Coast, (tho' next
adjoining,) they shall not exceed two or three Foot; and ten Leagues out at
Sea, (where no such Interruption is,) they become scarcely, if at all,
perceptible.

What I would deduce from this, besides a Confirmation of that ingenious
Theory of the Tides, by Captain _Halley_; is first, that the Ships bound to
_Angola, Cabenda_, and other Places on the Southern Coast of _Africa_,
should cross the _Æquinoctial_ from Cape _Palmas_, and run into a Southern
Latitude, without keeping too far to the Westward; and the Reason seems
plain, for if you endeavour to cross it about the Islands, you meet Calms,
southerly Winds and opposite Currents; and if too far to the Westward, the
trade Winds are strong and unfavourable; for it obliges you to stand into
28 or 30° Southern Latitude, till they are variable.

Secondly, On the Northern Side of _Guiney_, if Ships are bound from the
_Gold-Coast_ to _Sierraleon, Gambia_, or elsewhere to Windward, considering
the Weakness of these Currents, and the Favourableness of Land Breezes, and
Southerly in the Rains, Turnadoes, and even of the Trade Wind, when
a-breast of Cape _Palmas_, it is more expeditious to pursue the Passage
this Way, than by a long perambulatory Course of 4 or 500 Leagues to the
Westward, and as many more to the Northward, which must be before a Wind
can be obtained, that could recover the Coast.

Lastly, it is, in a great Measure, owning to this want of Inlets, and the
Rivers being small and unnavigable, that the Seas rebound with so dangerous
a Surff thro' the whole Continent.

Round the Shores of this Island, and at this Season, _(July, August_ and
_September_,) there is a great Resort of Whale-Fish, tame, and sporting
very nigh the Ships as they sail in, always in Pairs, the Female much the
smaller, and often seen to turn on their Backs for Dalliance, the Prologue
to engendring: It has an Enemy, called the Thresher, a large Fish too, that
has its Haunts here at this Season, and encounters the Whale, raising
himself out of the Water a considerable Heighth, and falling again with
great Weight and Force; it is commonly said also, that there is a Sword
Fish in these Battles, who pricks the Whale up to the Surface again, but
without this, I believe, he would suffocate when put to quick Motions,
unless frequently approaching the Air, to ventilate and remove the
impediments to a swifter Circulation: Nor do I think he is battled for
Prey, but to remove him from what is perhaps the Food of both. The Number
of Whales here has put me sometimes on thinking an advantageous Fishery
might be made of it, but I presume they (no more than those of _Brasil)_
are the Sort which yield the profitable Part, called Whale-Bone: All
therefore that the Islanders do, is now and then to go out with two or
three Canoes, and set on one for Diversion.

The Rocks and outer Lines of the Island, are the Haunts of variety of
Sea-Birds, especially Boobies and Noddies; the former are of the Bigness of
a Gull, and a dark Colour, named so from their Simplicity, because they
often sit still and let the Sailors take them up in their Hands; but I
fancy this succeeds more frequently from their Weariness, and the Largeness
of their Wings, which, when they once have rested, cannot have the Scope
necessary to raise and float them on the Air again. The Noddies are smaller
and flat footed also.

What I would remark more of them, is, the admirable Instinct in these
Birds, for the proper Seasons, and the proper Places for Support. In the
aforemention'd Months, when the large Fish were here, numerous Flocks of
Fowl attend for the Spawn and Superfluity of their Nourishment; and in
_January_ few of either; for the same Reason, there are scarce any Sea Fowl
seen on the _African_ Coast; Rocks and Islands being generally their best
Security and Subsistance.

The Harbour of _Princes_ is at the E. S. E. Point of the Island; the
North-Side has gradual Soundings, but here deep Water, having no Ground at
a Mile off with 140 Fathom of Line. The Port (when in) is a smooth narrow
Bay, safe from Winds, (unless a little Swell when Southerly) and draughted
into other smaller and sandy Ones, convenient for raising of Tents,
Watering, and hawling the Seam; the whole protected by a Fort, or rather
Battery, of a dozen Guns on the Larboard-Side. At the Head of the Bay
stands the Town, about a Mile from the anchoring Place, and consists of two
or three regular Streets, of wooden built Houses, where the Governor and
chief Men of the Island reside. Here the Water grows shallow for a
considerable Distance, and the Natives, at every Ebb, (having before
encompassed every convenient Angle with a Rise of Stones, something like
Weirs in _England_) resort for catching of Fish, which, with them, is a
daily Diversion, as well as Subsistance, 500 attending with Sticks and
wicker Baskets; and if they cannot dip them with one Hand, they knock them
down with the other. The Tides rise regularly 6 Foot in the Harbour, and
yet not half that Heighth without the Capes that make the Bay.

Here are constantly two Missionaries, who are sent for six Years to
inculcate the Christian Principles, and more especially attend the
Conversion of the Negroes; the present are _Venetians_, ingenious Men, who
seem to despise the loose Morals and Behaviour of the Seculars, and
complain of them as of the Slaves, _ut Color Mores sunt nigri_. They have a
neat Conventual-House and a Garden appropriated, which, by their own
Industry and Labour, not only thrives with the several Natives of the Soil,
but many Exoticks and Curiosities. A Fruit in particular, larger than a
Chesnut, yellow, containing two Stones, with a Pulp, or clammy Substance
about them, which, when suck'd, exceeds in Sweetness, Sugar or Honey, and
has this Property beyond them, of giving a sweet Taste to every Liquid you
swallow for the whole Evening after. The only Plague infesting the Garden,
is a Vermin called Land-Crabs, in vast Numbers, of a bright red Colour, (in
other Respects like the Sea ones) which burrough in these sandy Soils like
Rabbets, and are as shy.

The Island is a pleasant Intermixture of Hill and Valley; the Hills spread
with Palms, Coco-Nuts, and Cotton-Trees, with Numbers of Monkeys and
Parrots among them; the Valleys with fruitful Plantations of _Yamms,
Kulalu, Papas_, Variety of Sallating, _Ananas_, or Pine-Apples, _Guavas,
Plantanes, Bonanas, Manyocos_, and _Indian_ Corn; with Fowls, _Guinea_
Hens, _Muscovy_ Ducks, Goats, Hogs, Turkies, and wild Beefs, with each a
little Village of Negroes, who, under the Direction of their several
Masters, manage the Cultivation, and exchange or sell them for Money, much
after the same Rates with the People of St. _Thome_.

I shall run a Description of the Vegetables, with their Properties, not
only because they are the Produce of this Island, but most of them of
_Africa_ in general.

The Palm-Trees are numerous on the Shores of _Africa_, and may be reckoned
the first of their natural Curiosities, in that they afford them Meat,
Drink and Cloathing; they grow very straight to 40 and 50 Foot high, and at
the top (only) have 3 or 4 Circles of Branches, that spread and make a
capacious Umbrella. The Trunk is very rough with Knobs, either
Excrescencies, or the Healings of those Branches that were lopped off to
forward the Growth of the Tree, and make it answer better in its Fruit. The
Branches are strongly tied together with a _Cortex_, which may be
unravelled to a considerable Length and Breadth; the inward _Lamella_ of
this _Cortex_, I know are wove like a Cloath at _Benin_, and afterwards
died and worn: Under the Branches, and close to the were satisfied, and generous enough to
deliver him back every Thing he owned to be his: The Parson laid hold of
this favourable Disposition of the Pyrates, and laid Claim to several
Things belonging to others, which were also given up, to his great
Satisfaction; in fine, they kept nothing which belonged to the Church,
except three Prayer-Books, and a Bottle-Screw.

The Pyrates kept the _Onslow_ for their own Use, and gave Captain _Gee_ the
_French_ Ship, and then fell to making such Alterations as might fit her
for a Sea-Rover, pulling down her Bulk-Heads, and making her flush, so that
she became, in all Respects, as compleat a Ship for their Purpose, as any
they could have found; they continued to her the Name of the _Royal
Fortune_, and mounted her with 40 Guns.

She and the _Ranger_ proceeded (as I said before,) to _Jaquin_, and from
thence to _Old Calabar_, where they arrived about _October_, in order to
clean their Ships, a Place the most suitable along the whole Coast, for
there is a Bar with not above 15 Foot Water upon it, and the Channel
intricate, so that had the Men of War been sure of their being harbour'd
here, they might still have bid Defiance to their Strength, for the Depth
of Water at the Bar, as well as the want of a Pilot, was a sufficient
Security to the Rovers, and invincible Impediments to them. Here therefore
they sat easy, and divided the Fruits of their dishonest Instustry, _and
drank and drove Care away._ The Pilot who brought them into this Harbour,
was Captain _L--e_, who for this, and other Services, was extreamly well
paid, according to the Journal of their own Accounts, which do not run in
the ordinary and common way, of _Debtor, contra Creditor_, but much more
concise, lumping it to their Friends, and so carrying the Debt in their
Heads, against the next honest Trader they meet. They took at _Calabar_,
Captain _Loane_, and two or three _Bristol_ Ships, the Particulars of all
which would be an unnecessary Prolixity, therefore I come now to give an
Account of the Usage they received from the Natives of this Place. The
_Calabar_ Negroes did not prove so civil as they expected, for they refused
to have any Commerce or Trade with them, when they understood they were
Pyrates: An Indication that these poor Creatures, in the narrow
Circumstances they were in, and without the Light of the Gospel, or the
Advantage of an Education, have, notwithstanding, such a moral innate
Honesty, as would upbraid and shame the most knowing Christian: But this
did but exasperate these lawless Fellows, and so a Party of 40 Men were
detach'd to force a Correspondence, or drive the Negroes to Extremities;
and they accordingly landed under the Fire of their own Cannon. The Negroes
drew up in a Body of 2000 Men, as if they intended to dispute the Matter
with them, and staid till the Pyrates advanced within Pistol-shot; but
finding the Loss of two or three, made no Impression on the rest, the
Negroes thought fit to retreat, which they did, with some Loss: The Pyrates
set Fire to the Town, and then return'd to their Ships. This terrified the
Natives, and put an entire stop to all the Intercourse between them; so
that they could get no Supplies, which obliged them, as soon as they had
finished the cleaning and triming of their Ships, to lose no Time, but went
for Cape _Lopez_, and watered, and at _Anna-Bona_ took aboard a Stock of
fresh Provisions, and then sailed for the Coast again.

This was their last and fatal Expedition, which we shall be more particular
in, because, it cannot be imagined that they could have had Assurance to
have undertaken it, but upon a Presumption, that the Men of War, (whom they
knew were upon the Coast,) were unable to attack them, or else pursuant to
the Rumour that had indiscretionally obtained at _Sierraleon_, were gone
thither again.

It is impossible at this Time, to think they could know of the weak and
sickly Condition they were in, and therefore founded the Success of this
second Attempt upon the Coast, on the latter Presumption, and this seems to
be confirmed by their falling in with the Coast as low as Cape _Lahou_,
(and even that was higher than they designed,) in the beginning of
_January_, and took the Ship called the _King Solomon_, with 20 Men in
their Boat, and a trading Vessel, both belonging to the Company. The Pyrate
Ship happened to fall about a League to Leeward of the _King Solomon_, at
Cape _Appollonia_, and the Current and Wind opposing their working up with
the Ship, they agreed to send the Long-Boat, with a sufficient Number of
Men to take her: The Pyrates are all Voluntiers on these Occasions, the
Word being always given, _who will go?_ And presently the stanch and firm
Men offer themselves; because, by such Readiness, they recommend their
Courage, and have an Allowance also of a Shift of Cloaths, from Head to
Foot, out of the Prize.

They rowed towards the _King Solomon_ with a great deal of Alacrity, and
being hailed by the Commander of her, answered, _Defiance_; Captain
_Trahern_, before this, observing a great Number of Men in the Boat, began
not to like his Visitors, and prepared to receive them, firing a Musket as
they come under his Stern, which they returned with a Volley, and made
greater Speed to get on Board: Upon this, he applied to his Men, and ask'd
them, whether they would stand by him, to defend the Ship, it being a Shame
they should be taken by half their Number, without any Repulse? But his
Boatswain, _Philips_, took upon him to be the Mouth of the People, and put
an End to the Dispute; he said plainly, he would not, laid down his Arms in
the King's Name, as he was pleased to term it, and called out to the Boat
for Quarters, so that the rest, by his Example, were mislead to the losing
of the Ship.

When they came on Board, they brought her under Sail, by an expeditious
Method, of cutting the Cable; _Walden_, one of the Pyrates, telling the
Master, this _yo hope_ of heaving up the Anchor was a needless trouble,
when they designed to burn the Ship. They brought her under Commadore
_Roberts_'s Stern, and not only rifled her of what Sails, Cordage, _&c._
they wanted for themselves, but wantonly throw'd the Goods of the Company
overboard, like Spend-thrifts, that neither expected or designed any
Account.

On the same Day also, they took the _Flushing_, a _Dutch_ Ship, robbed her
of Masts, Yards and Stores, and then cut down her Fore-Mast; but what sat
as heavily as any thing with the _Skipper_, was, their taking some fine
Sausages he had on Board, of his Wife's making, and stringing them in a
ludicrous Manner, round their Necks, till they had sufficiently shew'd
their Contempt of them, and then threw them into the Sea. Others chopp'd
the Heads of his Fowls off, to be dressed for their Supper, and courteously
invited the Landlord, provided he would find Liquor. It was a melancholly
Request to the Man, but it must be comply'd with, and he was obliged, as
they grew drunk, to sit quietly, and hear them sing _French_ and _Spanish_
Songs out of his _Dutch_ Prayer-Books, with other Prophaness, that he (tho'
a _Dutch_ Man) stood amazed at.

In chasing too near in, they alarmed the Coast, and Expresses were sent to
the _English_ and _Dutch_ Factories, giving an Account of it: They were
sensible of this Error immediately, and because they would make the best of
a bad Market, resolved to keep out of sight of Land, and lose the Prizes
they might expect between that and _Whydah_, to make the more sure of that
Port, where commonly is the best Booty; all Nations trading thither,
especially _Portuguese_, who purchase chiefly with Gold, the Idol their
Hearts were bent upon. And notwithstanding this unlikely Course, they met
and took several Ships between _Axim_ and that Place; the circumstantial
Stories of which, and the pannick Terrors they struck into his Majesty's
Subjects, being tedious and unnecessary to relate, I shall pass by, and
come to their Arrival in that Road.

They came to _Whydah_ with a St. _George_'s Ensign, a black Silk Flag
flying at their Mizen-Peek, and a Jack and Pendant of the same: The Flag
had a Death in it, with an Hour-Glass in one Hand, and cross Bones in the
other, a Dart by it, and underneath a Heart dropping three Drops of
Blood.--The Jack had a Man pourtray'd in it, with a flaming Sword in his
Hand, and standing on two Skulls, subscribed _A B H_ and _A M H i. e._ a
_Barbadian_'s and a _Martinican_'s Head, as has been before taken Notice
of. Here they found eleven Sail in the Road, _English, French_ and
_Portuguese_; the _French_ were three stout Ships of 30 Guns, and upwards
of 100 Men each, yet when _Roberts_ came to Fire, they, with the other
Ships, immediately struck their Colours and surrendred to his Mercy. One
Reason, it must be confess'd, of his easy Victory, was, the Commanders and
a good Part of the Men being ashore, according to the Custom of the Place,
to receive the Cargoes, and return the Slaves, they being obliged to watch
the Seasons for it, which otherwise, in so dangerous a Sea as here, would
be impracticable. These all, except the _Porcupine_, ransomed with him for
eight Pound of Gold-Dust, a Ship, not without the trouble of some Letters
passing and repassing from the Shore, before they could settle it; and
notwithstanding the Agreement and Payment, they took away one of the
_French_ Ships, tho' with a Promise to return her, if they found she did
not sail well, taking with them several of her Men for that End.

Some of the Foreigners, who never had Dealing this Way before, desired for
Satisfaction to their Owners, that they might have Receipts for their
Money, which were accordingly given, a Copy of one of them, I have here
subjoined, _viz._

                                * * *

T_HIS is to certify whom it may or doth concern, that we_ GENTLEMEN
OF FORTUNE, _have received eight Pounds of Gold-Dust, for the Ransom of
the_ Hardey, _Captain_ Dittwitt _Commander, so that we Discharge the said
Ship_,

_Witness our Hands, this_ 13_th of_ Jan. 1721-2.

Batt. Roberts, Harry Glasby.

Others were given to the _Portuguese_ Captains, which were in the same
Form, but being sign'd by two waggish Fellows, _viz. Sutton_, and
_Sympson_, they subscribed by the Names of,

_Aaron Whifflingpin_, _Sim. Tugmutton._

But there was something so singularly cruel and barbarous done here to the
_Porcupine_, Captain _Fletcher_, as must not be passed over without special
Remark.

This Ship lay in the Road, almost slaved, when the Pyrates came in, and the
Commander being on Shore, settling his Accounts, was sent to for the
Ransom, but he excused it, as having no Orders from the Owners; though the
true Reason might be, that he thought it dishonourable to treat with
Robbers; and that the Ship, separate from the Slaves, towards whom he could
mistrust no Cruelty, was not worth the Sum demanded; hereupon, _Roberts_
sends the Boat to transport the Negroes, in order to set her on Fire; but
being in hast, and finding that unshackling them cost much Time and Labour,
they actually set her on Fire, with eighty of those poor Wretches on Board,
chained two and two together, under the miserable Choice of perishing by
Fire or Water: Those who jumped overboard from the Flames, were seized by
Sharks, a voracious Fish, in Plenty in this Road, and, in their Sight, tore
Limb from Limb alive. A Cruelty unparalell'd! And for which had every
Individual been hanged, few I imagine would think that Justice had been
rigorous.

The Pyrates, indeed, were obliged to dispatch their Business here in hast,
because they had intercepted a Letter from General _Phips_ to Mr.
_Baldwin_, the Royal _African_ Company's Agent at _Whydah_, (giving an
Account, that _Roberts_ had been seen to Windward of Cape _Three Points_,)
that he might the better guard against the Damages to the Company's Ships,
if he should arrive at that Road before the _Swallow_ Man of War, which he
assured him, (at the Time of that Letter,) was pursuing them to that Place.
_Roberts_ call'd up his Company, and desired they would hear _Phip_'s
Speech, (for so he was pleased to call the Letter,) and notwithstanding
their vapouring, perswaded them of the Necessity of moving; for, says he,
such brave Fellows cannot be supposed to be frightned at this News, yet
that it were better to avoid dry Blows, which is the best that can be
expected, if overtaken.

This Advice weigh'd with them, and they got under Sail, having stay'd only
from _Thursday_ to _Saturday_ Night, and at Sea voted for the Island of
_Anna Bona_; but the Winds hanging out of the Way, crossed their Purpose,
and brought them to Cape _Lopez_, where I shall leave them for their
approaching Fate, and relate some further Particulars of his Majesty's Ship
the _Swallow, viz._ where it was she had spent her Time, during the
Mischief that was done, and by what Means unable to prevent it; what also
was the Intelligence she received, and the Measures thereon formed, that at
last brought two such Strangers as Mr _Roberts_ and Capt. _Ogle_, to meet
in so remote a Corner of the World.

The _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ left _Sierraleon, May_ 28, where, I have
already taken Notice, _Roberts_ arrived about a Month after, and doubtless
learn'd the Intent of their Voyage, and cleaning on the Coast; which made
him set down with more Security to his Diversion, and furnish him with such
Intimations, as made his first Range down the Coast in _August_ following,
more prosperous; the _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ being then at the Port of
_Princes_ a cleaning.

Their Stay at _Princes_ was from _July_ 28 to _Sept._ 20, 1721, where, by a
Fatality, common to the Irregularities of Seamen, (who cannot in such Cases
be kept under due Restraints,) they buried 100 Men in three Weeks time, and
reduced the Remainder of the Ships Companies into so sickly a State, that
it was with Difficulty they brought them to sail; and this Misfortune was
probably the Ruin of _Roberts_, for it prevented the Men of War's going
back to _Sierraleon_, as it was intended, there being a Necessity of
leaving his Majesty's Ship _Weymouth_ (in much the worse Condition of the
two) under the Guns of Cape _Corso_, to impress Men, being unable at this
Time, either to hand the Sails, or weigh her Anchor; and _Roberts_ being
ignorant of the Occasion or Alteration of the first Design, fell into the
Mouth of Danger, when he thought himself the farthest from it; for the Men
of War not endeavouring to attain further to Windward (when they came from
_Princes_) then to secure Cape _Corso_ Road under their Lee, they luckily
hovered in the Track he had took.

The _Swallow_ and _Weymouth_ fell in with the Continent at Cape
_Appollonia, Octo._ 20th, and there received the ungrateful News from one
Captain _Bird_; a Notice that awaken'd and put them on their Guard; but
they were far from expecting any Temerity should ever bring him a second
Time on the Coast, while they were there; therefore the _Swallow_ having
seen the _Weymouth_ into Cape _Corso_ Road _Nov._ 10th, she ply'd to
Windward as far as _Bassam_, rather as an Airing to recover a sickly Ship's
Company, and shew herself to the Trade, which was found every where
undisturb'd, and were, for that Reason, returning to her Consort, when
accidently meeting a _Portuguese_ Ship, she told her, that the Day before
she saw two Ships Chace into _Junk_, an _English_ Vessel, which she
believed must have fallen into their Hands. On this Story, the _Swallow_
clung her Wind, and endeavoured to gain that Place, but receiving soon
after (_Octo._ the 14th) a contrary Report from Captain _Plummer_, an
intelligent Man, in the _Jason_ of _Bristol_, who had come further to
Windward, and neither saw or heard any Thing of this; she turned her Head
down the second Time, anchored at Cape _Appollonia_ the 23d, at Cape _Tres
Puntas_ the 27th, and in _Corso_ Road _January_ the 7th, 1721-2.

They learned that their Consort the _Weymouth_, was, by the Assistance of
some Soldiers from the Castle, gone to Windward, to demand Restitution of
some Goods or Men belonging to the _African_ Company, that were illegally
detained by the _Dutch_ at _Des Minas_; and while they were regretting so
long a Separation, an Express came to General _Phips_, from _Axim_, the
9th, and followed by another from _Dixcove_, (an _English_ Factory,) with
Information that three Ships had chased and taken a Galley nigh _Axim_
Castle, and a trading Boat belonging to the Company: No doubt was made,
concerning what they were, it being taken for granted they were Pyrates,
and supposed to be the same that had the _August_ before infested the
Coast. The natural Result therefore, from these two Advices, was, to hasten
for _Whydah_; for it was conclued the Prizes they had taken, had informed
them how nigh the _Swallow_ was, and withal, how much better in Health than
she had been for some Months past; so that unless they were very mad
indeed, they would (after being discovered) make the best of their Way for
_Whydah_, and secure the Booty there, without which, their Time and
Industry had been entirely lost; most of the Gold lying in that Corner.

The _Swallow_ weighed from _Cape-Corso, January_ the 10th, but was retarded
by waiting some Hours on the _Margaret_, a Company's Ship, at _Accra_,
again on the _Portugal_, and a whole Day at _Apong_, on a Person they used
to stile _Miss Betty_: A Conduct that Mr. _Phips_ blamed, when he heard the
Pyrates were miss'd at _Whydah_, altho' he had given it as his Opinion,
they could not be passed by, and intimated, that to stay a few Hours would
prove no Prejudice.

This, however, hinder'd the _Swallow_'s catching them at _Whydah_, for the
Pyrates came into that Road, with a fresh Gale of Wind, the same Day the
_Swallow_ was at _Apong_, and sail'd the 13th of _January_ from thence,
that she arrived the 17th. She gained Notice of them by a _French_ Shallop
from _Grand Papa_, the 14th at Night, and from _Little Papa_ next Morning
by a _Dutch_ Ship; so that the Man of War was on all Sides, as she thought,
sure of her Purchase, particularly when she made the Ships, and discovered
three of them to get under Sail immediately at Sight of her, making Signals
to one another, as tho' they designed a Defence; but they were found to be
three _French_ Ships; and those at Anchor, _Portuguese_ and _English_, all
honest Traders, who had been ransack'd and ransom'd.

This Disappointment chagreen'd the Ship's Company, who were very intent
upon their Market; which was reported to be an Arm-Chest full of Gold, and
kept with three Keys; tho' in all liklyhood, had they met with them in that
open Road, one or both would have made their Escapes; or if they had
thought sit to have fought, an Emulation in their Defence would probably
have made it desperate.

While they were contemplating on the Matter, a Letter was received from Mr.
_Baldwin_, (Governor here for the Company,) signifying, that the Pyrates
were at _Jaquin_, seven Leagues lower. The _Swallow_ weighed at two next
Morning, _January_ the 16th, and got to _Jaquin_ by Day-Light, but to no
other End, than frightening the Crews of two _Portuguese_ Ships on Shore,
who took her for the Pyrate that had struck such Terror at _Whydah_: She
returned therefore that Night, and having been strengthened with thirty
Voluntiers, _English_ and _French_, the discarded Crews of the _Porcupine_,
and the _French_ Ship they had carried from hence, she put to Sea again
_January_ the 19th, conjecturing, that either _Calabar, Princes_, the River
_Gabone_, Cape _Lopez_, or _Annabona_, must be touched at for Water and
Refreshment, tho' they should resolve to leave the Coast. As to the former
of those Places, I have before observed, it was hazardous to think of, or
rather impracticable; _Princes_ had been a sower Grape to them, but being
the first in the Way, she came before the Harbour the 29th, where learning
no News, without loosing Time, steered for the River _Gabone_, and anchored
at the Mouth of it _February_ the 1st.

This River is navigable by two Channels, and has an Island about five
Leagues up, called _Popaguays_ or _Parrots_, where the _Dutch_ Cruisers,
for this Coast, generally Clean, and where sometimes Pyrates come in to
look for Prey, or to Refit, it being very convenient, by Reason of a soft
Mud about it, that admits a Ship's lying on Shore, with all her Guns and
Stores in, without Damage. Hither Captain _Ogle_ sent his Boat and a
Lieutenant, who spoke with a _Dutch_ Ship, above the Island, from whom he
had this Account, _viz._ That he had been four Days from Cape _Lopez_, and
had left no Ship there. However, they beat up for the Cape, without regard
to this Story, and on the 5th, at Dawning, was surprized with the Noise of
a Gun, which, as the Day brightened, they found was from Cape _Lopez_ Bay,
where they discovered three Ships at Anchor, the largest with the King's
Colours and Pendant flying, which was soon after concluded to be Mr.
_Roberts_ and his Consorts; but the _Swallow_ being to Windward, and
unexpectedly deep in the Bay, was obliged to Steer off, for avoiding a
Sand, called the _French Man_'s _Bank_, which the Pyrates observed for some
Time, and rashly interpreting it to be Fear in her, righted the _French
Ranger_, which was then on the Heel, and ordered her to chase out in all
hast, bending several of their Sails in the Pursuit. The Man of War finding
they had foolishly mistaken her Design, humoured the Deceit, and kept off
to Sea, as if she had been really afraid, and managed her Steerage so,
under the Direction of Lieutenant _Sun_, an experienced Officer, as to let
the _Ranger_ come up with her, when they thought they had got so far as not
to have their Guns heard by her Consort at the Cape. The Pyrates had such
an Opinion of their own Courage, that they could never dream any Body would
use a Stratagem to speak with them, and so was the more easily drawn into
the Snare.

The Pyrates now drew nigh enough to fire their Chase Guns; they hoisted the
black Flag that was worn in _Whydah_ Road, and got their Spritsail Yard
along-ships, with Intent to board; no one having ever asked, all this
while, what Country Ship they took the Chase to be; they would have her to
be a _Portuguese_, (Sugar being then a Commodity among them,) and were
swearing every Minute at the Wind or Sails to expedite so sweet a Chase;
but, alass, all turned sour in an Instant: It was with the utmost
Consternation they saw her suddenly bring to, and hawl up her lower Ports,
now within Pistol-shot, and struck their black Flag upon it directly. After
the first Surprize was over, they kept firing at a Distance, hoisted it
again, and vapoured with their Cutlashes on the Poop; tho' wisely
endeavouring at the same Time to get away. Being now at their Wits end,
boarding was proposed by the Heads of them, and so to make one desperate
Push; but the Motion not being well seconded, and their Main-Top-Mast
coming down by a Shot, after two Hours firing, it was declin'd; they grew
Sick, struck their Colours, and called out for Quarters; having had 10 Men
killed out right, and 20 wounded, without the loss or hurt of one of the
King's Men. She had 32 Guns, mann'd with 16 _French_ Men, 20 Negroes, and
77 _English._ The Colours were thrown over board, that they might not rise
in Judgment, nor be display'd in Tryumph over them.

While the _Swallow_ was sending their Boat to fetch the Prisoners, a Blast
and Smoak was seen to pour out of the great Cabin, and they thought they
were blowing up; but upon enquiry afterwards, found that half a dozen of
the most Desperate, when they saw all Hopes fled, had drawn themselves
round what Powder they had left in the Steerage, and fired a Pistol into
it, but it was too small a Quantity to effect any Thing more, than burning
them in a frightful Manner.

This Ship was commanded by one _Skyrme_, a _Welch_ Man, who, tho' he had
lost his Leg in the Action, would not suffer himself to be dressed, or
carried off the Deck; but, like _Widrington_, fought upon his Stump. The
rest appeared gay and brisk, most of them with white Shirts, Watches, and a
deal of Silk Vests, but the Gold-Dust belonging to them, was most of it
left in the _Little Ranger_ in the Bay, (this Company's proper Ship,) with
the _Royal Fortune._

I cannot but take Notice of two among the Crowd, of those disfigured from
the Blast of Powder just before mentioned, _viz. William Main_ and _Roger
Ball._ An Officer of the Ship seeing a Silver Call hang at the Wast of the
former, said to him, _I presume you are Boatswain of this Ship. Then you
presume wrong_, answered he, _for I am Boatswain of the_ Royal Fortune,
_Captain_ Roberts _Commander. Then Mr._ Boatswain _you will be hanged I
believe_, replies the Officer. _That is as your Honour pleases_, answered
he again, and was for turning away: But the Officer desired to know of him,
how the Powder, which had made them in that Condition, came to take
Fire.--_By G_-- says he, _they are all mad and bewitch'd, for I have lost a
good Hat by it._ (the Hat and he being both blown out of the Cabin Gallery,
into the Sea.) _But what signifies a Hat Friend_, says the Officer.-_Not
much_ answer'd he, the Men being busy in stripping him of his Shoes and
Stockings.--The Officer then enquired of him, whether _Roberts_'s Company
were as likely Fellows as these.-- _There are_ 120 _of them_, (answered he)
_as clever Fellows as ever trod Shoe Leather: Would I were with them!--No
doubt on't_, says the Officer.--_By G-- it is naked Truth_, answered he,
looking down and seeing himself, by this Time, quite striped.

The Officer then approached _Roger Ball_, who was seated in a private
Corner, with a Look as sullen as Winter, and asked him, how he came blown
up in that frightful Manner.--_Why_, says he, John Morris _fired a Pistol
into the Powder, and if he had not done it, I would_, (bearing his Pain
without the least Complaint.) The Officer gave him to understand he was
Surgeon, and if he desired it, he would dress him; but he swore it should
not be done, and that if any Thing was applied to him, he would tear it
off.--Nevertheless the Surgeon had good Nature enough to dress him, tho'
with much trouble: At Night he was in a kind of _Delirium_, and raved on
the Bravery of _Roberts_, saying, he should shortly be released, as soon as
they should meet him, which procured him a lashing down upon the
Forecastle, which he resisting with all his Force, caused him to be used
with the more Violence, so that he was tied down with so much Severity,
that his Flesh being sore and tender with the blowing up, he died next Day
of a Mortification.

They secured the Prisoners with Pinions, and Shackles, but the Ship was so
much disabled in the Engagement, that they had once Thoughts to set her on
Fire; but this would have given them the Trouble of taking the Pyrates
wounded Men on Board themselves, and that they were certain the _Royal
Fortune_ would wait for their Consort's Return, they lay by her two Days,
repaired her Rigging and other Damages, and sent her into _Princes_, with
the _French_ Men, and four of their own Hands.

On the 9th in the Evening, the _Swallow_ gained the Cape again, and saw the
_Royal Fortune_ standing into the Bay with the _Neptune_, Captain _Hill_,
of _London_: A good Presage of the next Day's Success, for they did not
doubt but the Temptation of Liquor, and Plunder, they might find in this
their new Prize, would make the Pyrates very confused; and so it happened.

On the 10th, in the Morning, the Man of War bore away to round the Cape.
_Roberts_'s Crew discerning their Masts over the Land, went down into the
Cabin, to acquaint him of it, he being then at Breakfast with his new
Guest, Captain _Hill_, on a savory Dish of Solomongundy, and some of his
own Beer. He took no Notice of it, and his Men almost as little, some
saying she was a _Portuguese_ Ship, others a _French_ Slave Ship, but the
major Part swore it was the _French Ranger_ returning, and were merrily
debating for some Time, on the Manner of Reception, whether they should
salute, or not; but as the _Swallow_ approached nigher, Things appeared
plainer, and though they were stigmatiz'd with the Name of Cowards, who
shewed any Apprehension of Danger, yet some of them, now undeceived,
declared it to _Roberts_, especially one _Armstrong_, who had deserted from
that Ship, and knew her well: Those _Roberts_ swore at as Cowards, who
meant to dishearten the Men, asking them if it were so, whether they were
afraid to fight, or no? And hardly refrained from Blows. What his own
Apprehensions were, till she hawled up her Ports, and hoisted their proper
Colours, is uncertain; but then being perfectly convinced, he slipped his
Cable, got under Sail, and ordered his Men to Arms, without any shew of
Timidity, dropping a first Rate Oath, _that it was a Bite_, but, at the
same Time, resolved, like a gallant Rogue, to get clear, or die.

There was one _Armstrong_, as I just mention'd, a Deserter from the
_Swallow_, whom they enquired of concerning the Trim and Sailing of that
Ship; he told them she sail'd best upon a Wind, and therefore, if they
designed to leave her, they should go before it.

The Danger was imminent, and Time very short, to consult of Means to
extricate himself; his Resolution in this Streight, was as follows: To pass
close to the _Swallow_, with all their Sails, and receive her Broadside,
before they returned a Shot; if disabled by this, or that they could not
depend on sailing, then to run on Shore at the Point, (which is steep to)
and every one to shift for himself among the Negroes; or failing in these,
to board, and blow up together, for he saw that the greatest Part of his
Men were drunk, passively Couragious, unfit for Service.

_Roberts_ himself made a gallant Figure, at the Time of the Engagement,
being dressed in a rich crimson Damask Wastcoat and Breeches, a red Feather
in his Hat, a Gold Chain round his Neck, with a Diamond Cross hanging to
it, a Sword in his Hand, and two Pair of Pistols hanging at the End of a
Silk Sling, flung over his Shoulders (according to the Fashion of the
Pyrates;) and is said to have given his Orders with Boldness, and Spirit;
coming, according to what he had purposed, close to the Man of War,
received her Fire, and then hoisted his Black Flag, and returned it,
shooting away from her, with all the Sail he could pack; and had he took
_Armstrong_'s Advice, to have gone before the Wind, he had probably
escaped; but keeping his Tacks down, either by the Winds shifting, or ill
Steerage, or both, he was taken a-back with his Sails, and the _Swallow_
came a second Time very nigh to him: He had now perhaps finished the Fight
very desperately, if Death, who took a swift Passage in a Grape-Shot, had
not interposed, and struck him directly on the Throat. He settled himself
on the Tackles of a Gun, which one _Stephenson_, from the Helm, observing,
ran to his Assistance, and not perceiving him wounded, swore at him, and
bid him stand up, and fight like a Man; but when he found his Mistake, and
that his Captain was certainly dead, he gushed into Tears, and wished the
next Shot might be his Lot. They presently threw him over-board, with his
Arms and Ornaments on, according to the repeated Request he made in his
Life-time.

_Roberts_ was a tall black Man, near forty Years of Age, born at
_Newey-bagh_, nigh _Haverford-West_, in _Pembrokshire_, of good natural
Parts, and personal Bravery, tho' he applied them to such wicked Purposes,
as made them of no Commendation, frequently drinking _D--n to him who ever
lived to wear a Halter._ He was forc'd himself at first among this Company
out of the _Prince_, Captain _Plumb_ at _Anamaboe_, about three Years
before, where he served as second Mate, and shed, as he us'd to tell the
_fresh Men_, as many Crocodile Tears then as they did now, but Time and
good Company had wore it off. He could not plead Want of Employment, nor
Incapacity of getting his Bread in an honest way, to favour so vile a
Change, nor was he so much a Coward as to pretend it; but frankly own'd, it
was to get rid of the disagreeable Superiority of some Masters he was
acquainted with, and the Love of Novelty and Change, Maritime
Peregrinations had accustom'd him to. _In an honest Service_, says he,
_there is thin Commons, low Wages, and hard Labour; in this, Plenty and
Satiety, Pleasure and Ease, Liberty and Power; and who would not ballance
Creditor on this Side, when all the Hazard that is run for it, at worst, is
only a sour Look or two at choaking. No_, A merry Life and a short one,
_shall be my Motto._ Thus he preach'd himself into an Approbation of what
he at first abhorr'd; and being daily regal'd with Musick, Drinking, and
the Gaiety and Diversions of his Companions, these deprav'd Propensities
were quickly edg'd and strengthen'd, to the extinguishing of Fear and
Conscience. Yet among all the vile and ignominious Acts he had perpetrated,
he is said to have had an Aversion towards forcing Men into that Service,
and had procured some their Discharge, notwithstanding so many made it
their Plea.

When _Roberts_ was gone, as tho' he had been the Life and Soul of the Gang,
their Spirits sunk; many deserted their Quarters, and all stupidly
neglected any Means for Defence, or Escape; and their Main-mast soon after
being shot by the Board, they had no Way left, but to surrender and call
for Quarters. The _Swallow_ kept aloof, while her Boat passed, and repassed
for the Prisoners; because they understood they were under an Oath to blow
up; and some of the Desperadoes shewed a Willingness that Way, Matches
being lighted, and Scuffles happening between those who would, and those
who opposed it: But I cannot easily account for this Humour, which can be
term'd no more than a false Courage, since any of them had Power to destroy
his own Life, either by Pistol, or Drowning, without involving others in
the same Fate, who are in no Temper of Mind for it: And at best, it had
been only dying, for fear of Death.

She had 40 Guns, and 157 Men, 45 whereof were Negroes; three only were
killed in the Action, without any Loss to the _Swallow._ There was found
upwards of 2000 _l._ in Gold-Dust in her. The Flag could not be got easily
from under the fallen Mast, and was therefore recover'd by the _Swallow_;
it had the Figure of a Skeleton in it, and a Man pourtray'd with a flaming
Sword in his Hand, intimating a Defyance of Death it self.

The _Swallow_ returned back into Cape _Lopez_ Bay, and found the little
_Ranger_, whom the Pyrates had deserted in hast, for the better Defence of
the Ship: She had been plunder'd, according to what I could learn, of 2000
l. in Gold-Dust, (the Shares of those Pyrates who belonged to her;) and
Captain _Hill_, in the _Neptune_, not unjustly suspected, for he would not
wait the Man of War's returning into the Bay again, but sail'd away
immediately, making no Scruple afterwards to own the Seizure of other Goods
out of her, and surrender'd, as a Confirmation of all, 50 Ounces at
_Barbadoes_, for which, see the Article at the End of this Book.

_All Persons who after the_ 29_th of_ Septem. 1690, &c.

To sum up the whole, if it be considered, first, that the sickly State of
the Men of War, when they sail'd from _Princes_, was the Misfortune that
hindered their being as far as _Sierraleon_, and consequently out of the
Track the Pyrates then took. That those Pyrates, directly contrary to their
Design, in the second Expedition, should get above Cape _Corso_, and that
nigh _Axim_, a Chace should offer, that inevitably must discover them, and
be soon communicated to the Men of War. That the satiating their evil and
malicious Tempers at _Whydah_, in burning the _Porcupine_, and running off
with the _French_ Ship, had strengthened the _Swallow_ with 30 Men. That
the _Swallow_ should miss them in that Road, where probably she had not, or
at least so effectually obtained her End. That they should be so far
infatuated at Cape _Lopez_, as to divide their Strength, which when
collected, might have been so formidable. And lastly, that the Conquest
should be without Bloodshed: I say, considering all these Circumstances, it
shews that the Hand of Providence was concerned in their Destruction. As to
their Behaviour after they were taken, it was found that they had great
Inclinations to rebel, if they could have laid hold of any Opportunity. For
they were very uneasy under Restraint, having been lately all Commanders
themselves; nor could they brook their Diet, or Quarters, without cursing
and swearing, and upbraiding each other, with the Folly that had brought
them to it.

So that to secure themselves against any mad desperate Undertaking of
theirs, they strongly barricado'd the Gun-Room, and made another Prison
before it; an Officer, with Pistols and Cutlashes, doing Duty, Night and
Day, and the Prisoners within, manacled and shackled.

They would yet in these Circumstances be impudently merry, saying, when
they viewed their Nakedness, _that they had not left them a halfpenny, to
give old_ Charon, _to ferry them over_ Stix: And at their thin Commons,
they would observe, that they fell away so fast, that they should not have
Weight left to hang them. _Sutton_ used to be very prophane; he happening
to be in the same Irons with another Prisoner, who was more serious than
ordinary, and read and pray'd often, as became his Condition; this Man
_Sutton_ used to swear at, and ask him, _what he proposed by so much Noise
and Devotion? Heaven_, says the other, _I hope. Heaven, you Fool_, says
_Sutton, did you ever hear of any Pyrates going thither? Give me H--ll,
it's a merrier Place; I'll give_ Roberts _a Salute of_ 13 _Guns at
Entrance._ And when he found such ludicrous Expressions had no Effect on
him, he made a formal Complaint, and requested that the Officer would
either remove this Man, or take his Prayer-Book away, as a common
Disturber.

A Combination and Conspiracy was formed, betwixt _Moody, Ashplant, Magnes,
Mare_, and others, to rise, and kill the Officers, and run away with the
Ship. This they had carried on by Means of a Mulatto Boy, who was allow'd
to attend them, and proved very trusty in his Messages, between the
Principals; but the Evening of that Night they were to have made this
Struggle, two of the Prisoners that sat next to _Ashplant_, heard the Boy
whisper them upon the Project, and naming to him the Hour they should be
ready, presently gave Notice of it to the Captain, which put the Ship in an
Alarm, for a little Time; and, on Examination, several of them had made
shift to break off, or lose, their Shackles, (no doubt for such Purpose;)
but it tended only to procure to themselves worse Usage and Confinement.

In the same Passage to Cape _Corso_, the Prize, _Royal Fortune_, was in the
same Danger. She was left at the Island of St. _Thomas_'s, in the
Possession of an Officer, and a few Men, to take in some fresh Provisions,
(which were scarce at Cape _Corso_) with Orders to follow the Ship. There
were only some of the Pyrates Negroes, three or four wounded Prisoners, and
_Scudamore_, their Surgeon; from whom they seemed to be under no
Apprehension, especially from the last, who might have hoped for Favour, on
Account of his Employ; and had stood so much indebted for his Liberty,
eating and drinking constantly with the Officer; yet this Fellow,
regardless of the Favour, and lost to all Sense of Reformation, endeavoured
to bring over the Negroes to his Design of murdering the People, and
running away with the Ship. He easily prevailed with the Negroes to come
into the Design; but when he came to communicate it to his Fellow
Prisoners, and would have drawn them into the same Measures, by telling
them, he understood Navigation, that the Negroes were stout Fellows, and by
a Smattering he had in the _Angolan_ Language, he had found willing to
undertake such an Enterprize; and that it was better venturing to do this,
run down the Coast, and raise a new Company, than to proceed to Cape
_Corso_, and be hanged like a Dog, and Sun dry'd. One of them abhorring the
Cruelty, or fearing the Success, discovered it to the Officer, who made him
immediately a Prisoner, and brought the Ship safe.

When they came to be lodg'd in Cape _Corso-Castle_, their Hopes of this
kind all cut off, and that they were assured they must there soon receive a
final Sentence; the Note was changed among most of them, and from vain
insolent jesting, they became serious and devout, begging for good Books,
and joyning in publick Prayers, and singing of Psalms, twice at least every
Day.

As to their Tryals, if we should give them at length, it may appear tedious
to the Reader, for which Reason, I have, for the avoiding Tautology and
Repetition, put as many of them together as were try'd for the same Fact,
reserving the Circumstances which are most material, with Observations on
the dying Behaviour of such of them, as came to my Knowledge.

And first, it may be observed from the List, that a great Part of these
Pyrate Ships Crews, were Men entered on the Coast of _Africa_, not many
Months before they were taken; from whence, it may be concluded, that the
pretended Constraint of _Roberts_, on them, was very often a Complotment
between Parties equally willing: And this _Roberts_ several Times openly
declared, particularly to the _Onslow_'s People, whom he called aft, and
ask'd of them, _who was willing to go, for he would force no Body?_ As was
deposed, by some of his best Hands, after Acquittal; nor is it reasonable
to think, he should reject _Irish_ Voluntiers, only from a Pique against
_Kennedy_, and force others, that might hazard, and, in Time, destroy his
Government: But their Behaviour soon put him out of this Fear, and
convinc'd him, that the Plea of Force was only the best Artifice they had
to shelter themselves under, in Case they should be taken; and that they
were less Rogues than others, only in Point of Time.

It may likewise be taken Notice of, that the Country, wherein they happened
to be tried, is among other Happinesses, exempted from Lawyers, and
Law-Books, so that the Office of Register, of necessity fell on one, not
versed in those Affairs, which might justify the Court in want of Form,
more essentially supply'd with Integrity and Impartiality.

But, perhaps, if there was less Law, there might be more Justice, than in
some other Courts; for, if the civil Law be a Law of universal Reason,
judging of the Rectitude, or Obliquity of Mens Actions, every Man of common
Sense is endued with a Portion of it, at least sufficient to make him
distinguish Right from Wrong, or what the Civilians call, _Malum in se._

Therefore, here, if two Persons were equally Guilty of the same Fact, there
was no convicting one, and bringing the other off, by any Quirk, or turn of
Law; for they form'd their Judgments upon the Constraint, or Willingness,
the Aim, and Intention of the Parties, and all other Circumstances, which
make a material Difference. Besides, in Crimes of this Nature, Men bred up
to the Sea, must be more knowing, and much abler, than others more learned
in the Law; for, before a Man can have a right Idea of a Thing, he must
know the Terms standing for that Thing: The Sea-Terms being a Language by
it self, which no Lawyer can be supposed to understand, he must of
Consequence want that discriminating Faculty, which should direct him to
judge right of the Facts meant by those Terms.

The Court well knew, it was not possible to get the Evidence of every
Sufferer by this Crew, and therefore, first of all, considered how that
Deficiency should be supplied; whether, or no, they could pardon one _Jo.
Dennis_, who had early offered himself, as King's Evidence, and was the
best read in their Lives and Conversations: Here indeed, they were at a
Loss for Law, and concluded in the Negative, because it look'd like
compounding with a Man to swear falsly, losing by it, those great Helps he
could have afforded.

Another great Difficulty in their Proceedings, was, how to understand those
Words in the Act of Parliament, of, _particularly specifying in the Charge,
the Circumstances of Time, Place_, &c. _i. e._ so to understand them, as to
be able to hold a Court; for if they had been indicted on particular
Robberies, the Evidence had happened mostly from the Royal _African_
Company's Ships, on which these Gentlemen of _Cape-Corso-Castle_, were not
qualify'd to sit, their Oath running, _That they have no Interest directly,
or indirectly, in the Ship, or Goods, for the Robbery of which, the Party
stands accused_: And this they thought they had, Commissions being paid
them, on such Goods: And on the other Side, if they were incapacitated, no
Court could be formed, the Commission absolutely requiring three of them by
Name.

To reconcile all Things, therefore, the Court resolved, to bottom the whole
of their Proceedings on the _Swallow's_ Depositions, which were clear and
plain, and had the Circumstance of Time when, Place where, Manner how, and
the like, particularly specified according to the Statute in that Case
made, and provided. But this admitted only a general Intimation of Robbery
in the Indictment, therefore _to approve their Clemency_, it looking
Arbitrary on the Lives of Men, to lump them to the Gallows, in such a
summary Way as must have been done, had they solely adhered to the
_Swallow_'s Charge, they resolved to come to particular Tryals.

Secondly, _That the Prisoners might not be ignorant whereon to answer_, and
so have all fair Advantages, to excuse and defend themselves; the Court
farther agreed with Justice and Equanimity, to hear any Evidence that could
be brought, to weaken or corroborate the three Circumstances that compleat
a Pyrate; first, being a Voluntier amongst them at the Beginning; secondly,
being a Voluntier at the taking or robbing of any Ship; or lastly,
voluntarily accepting a Share in the Booty of those that did; for by a
Parity of Reason, where these Actions were of their own disposing, and yet
committed by them, it must be believed their Hearts and Hands joyned
together, in what they acted against his Majesty's Ship the _Swallow._

_The_ TRYALS _of the_ PYRATES,

_Taken by his Majesty's Ship the_ Swallow, _begun at Cape_
Corso-Castle, _on the Coast of_ Africa, March _the_ 28_th_, 1722.

THE Commission impowered any three named therein, to call to their
Assistance, such a Number of qualified Persons as might make the Court
always consist of seven: And accordingly Summons were signed to Lieut. _Jo.
Barnsley_, Lieut. _Ch. Fanshaw_, Capt. _Samuel Hartsease_, and Capt.
_William Menzies, viz._

   BY Virtue of a Power and Authority, to us given, by a
   Commission from the King, under the Seal of Admiralty,
   You are hereby required to attend, and make one of the
   Court, for the trying and adjudging of the Pyrates,
   lately taken on this Coast, by his Majesty's Ship the
   _Swallow._

Given under our Hands this 28th of _March_, 1722, at Cape
_Carso-Castle._

_Mungo Heardman_, _James Phips_, _Henry Dodson_, _Francis Boy_,
_Edward Hide._

The Commissioners being met in the Hall of the Castle, the Commission was
first read, after which, the President, and then the other Members, took
the Oath, prescribed in the Act of Parliament, and having directed the Form
of that for Witnesses, as follows, the Court was opened.

I, A. B. _solemnly promise and swear on the Holy Evangelists, to bear
true and faithful Witness between the King and Prisoner, or Prisoners, in
Relation to the Fact, or Facts, of Pyracy and Robbery, he or they do now
stand accused of._ So help me God.

The Court consisted of Captain _Mungo Heardman_, President. James Phips,
_Esq; General of the Coast_, _Mr._ H. Dodson, _Mer._ _Mr._ F. Boye, _Mer._
_Mr._ Edward Hyde, _Secretary to the Company._ _Lieut._ John Barnsley,
_Lieut._ Ch. Fanshaw.

The following Prisoners, out of the Pyrate Ship _Ranger_, having been
commanded before them, the Charge, or Indictment, was exhibited.

William Church        Gertruych the Air_; the Prince of
Darkness, the Prince of _Devils_, and the like, and his attending
Spirits are call'd _his Angels_: so that however _Satan_ has lost the
glory and rectitude of his Nature, by his apostate state, yet he retains
a greatness and magnificence, which places him above our rank, and
indeed above our conception; for we know not what he is, any more than
we know what the blessed Angels are; of whom we can say no more than
that they are _ministring Spirits_, &c. as the Scripture has describ'd
them.

Two things, however, may give us some insight into the nature of the
Devil, in the present state he is in; and these we have a clear
discovery of in the whole series of his Conduct from the Beginning.

     1. That he is the vanquish'd but implacable enemy of God his
     Creator, who has conquer'd him, and expell'd him from the
     habitations of bliss; on which account he is fill'd with envy,
     rage, malice, and all uncharitableness; would dethrone God and
     overturn the thrones of Heaven, if it was in his power.

     2. That he is man's irreconcilable Enemy; not as he is a man, nor
     on his own account simply, nor for any advantage he (the Devil) can
     make by the ruin and destruction of man; but in meer envy at the
     felicity he is supposed to enjoy as Satan's rival; and as he is
     appointed to succeed Satan and his Angels in the possession of
     those glories from which they are fallen.


And here I must take upon me to say, Mr. _Milton_ makes a wrong judgment
of the reason of _Satan_'s resolution to disturb the felicity of man; He
tells us it was meerly to affront God his Maker, rob him of the glory
design'd in his new work of creations and to disappoint him in his main
design, namely, the creating a new species of creatures in a perfect
rectitude of soul, and after his own image, from whom he might expect a
new Fund of glory should be rais'd, and who was to appear as the triumph
of the Messiah's victory over the Devil. In all which Satan could not be
fool enough not to know that he should be disappointed by the same
Power which had so eminently counter-acted his rage before.

But, I believe, the Devil went upon a much more probable design; and
tho' he may be said to act upon a meaner principle than that of pointing
his rage at the personal glory of his Creator; yet I own, that in my
opinion, it was by much the more rational undertaking, and more likely
to succeed; and that was, that whereas he perceived this new species of
creatures had a sublime as well as a human part, and were made capable
of possessing the mansions of eternal Beatitude, from whence, he
(_Satan_) and his Angels were expell'd and irretrievably banish'd; envy
at such a rival mov'd him by all possible artifice, _for he saw him
deprived of capacity to do it by force_, to render him unworthy like
himself; that bringing him to fall into rebellion and disobedience, he
might see his Rival damn'd with him; and those who were intended to fill
up the empty spaces in Heaven, made so by the absence of so many
millions of fallen Angels, be cast out into the same darkness with them.

How he came to know that this new species of creatures were liable to
such imperfection, is best explain'd by the _Devil_'s prying, vigilant
disposition, judging or leading him to judge by himself; (for he was as
near being infallible as any of God's creatures had been) and then
inclining him to try whether it was so or no.

Modern Naturalists, especially some who have not so large a charity for
the fair sex, as I have, tell us, that as soon as ever Satan saw the
woman, and look'd in her face, he saw evidently that she was the best
form'd creature to make a Tool of, and the best to make a hypocrite of,
that could be made, and therefore the most fitted for his purpose.

1. He saw by some thwart lines in her face, (legible, perhaps, to
himself only) that there was a throne ready prepar'd for the sin of
pride to sit in state upon, especially if it took an early possession:
EVE you may suppose was a perfect Beauty, if ever such a thing may be
supposed in the human frame; her figure being so extraordinary, was the
groundwork of his project; there needed no more than to bring her to be
vain of it, and to conceit that it either was so, or was infinitely more
sublime and beautiful than it really was; and having thus tickl'd her
vanity, to introduce Pride gradually, till at last he might persuade
her, that she was really Angelic, or of heavenly Race, and wanted
nothing but to eat the forbidden fruit, and that would make her
something more excellent still.

2. Looking farther into her Frame, and with a nearer view to her
imperfections, he saw room to conclude that she was of a constitution
easy to be seduc'd, and especially by flattering her; raising a
commotion in her Soul, and a disturbance among her passions; and
accordingly he set himself to work, to disturb her repose, and put
dreams of great things into her head; together with something of a
nameless Kind, which (however, some have been ill-natur'd enough to
suggest) I shall not injure the Devil so much as to mention, without
better evidence.

3. But, besides this, he found, upon the very first survey of her
outside, something so very charming in her mein and behaviour, so
engaging as well as agreeable in the whole texture of her person, and
withal such a sprightly wit, such a vivacity of parts, such a fluency of
tongue, and above all, such a winning prevailing whine in her smiles, or
at least in her tears, that he made no doubt if he could but once delude
her, she would easily be brought to delude _Adam_, whom he found set not
only a great value upon her person, but was perfectly captivated by her
charms; in a word, he saw plainly, that if he could but ruin her, he
should easily make a Devil of her, to ruin her husband, and draw him
into any gulph of mischief, were it ever so black and dreadful, that she
should first fall into herself; how far some may be wicked enough, from
hence, to suggest of the _fair sex_, that they have been Devils to their
husbands ever since, I cannot say; I hope they will not be so unmerciful
to discover truths of such fatal consequence, tho' they should come to
their knowledge.

Thus subtle and penetrating has Satan been from the beginning; and who
can wonder that upon these discoveries made into the woman's inside, he
went immediately to work with her, rather than with _Adam_? not but that
one would think, if _Adam_ was fool enough to be deluded by his wife,
the Devil might have seen so much of it in his countenance, as to have
encourag'd him to make his attack directly upon him, and not go round
about, beating the bush, and ploughing with the Heifer; setting upon the
woman first, and then setting her upon her husband, who might as easily
have been imposed upon as she.

Other Commentators upon this critical Text suggest to us, that _Eve_ was
not so pleased with the hopes of being made a Goddess; That the pride of
a Seraphic Knowledge did not so much work upon her imagination to bring
her to consent, as a certain secret Notion infus'd into her head by the
same wicked instrument, that she should be wiser than _Adam_, and should
by the superiority of her understanding, necessarily have the government
over him; which, at present, she was sensible she had not, he being
master of a particular air of gravity and majesty, as well as of
strength, infinitely superior to her.

This is an ill-natur'd suggestion; but it must be confess'd the
impatient desire of government, which (since that) appears in the
general Behaviour of the sex, and particularly of governing husbands,
leaves too much room to legitimate the supposition.

The Expositors, who are of this opinion, add to it, that this being her
original crime, or the particular temptation to that crime; Heaven
thought fit to shew his justice, in making her more entire subjection to
her husband be a part of the Curse, that she might read her sin in the
punishment, (_viz._) _he shall rule over thee_.

I only give the general hint of these things as they appear recorded in
the annals of _Satan_'s first Tyranny, and at the beginning of his
government in the World; those that would be more particularly inform'd,
may enquire of him _and know farther_.

I cannot however, but observe here _with some regret_, how it appears by
the consequence, that the Devil was not mistaken when he made an early
judgment of Mrs. _Eve_; and how _Satan_ really went the right way to
work, to judge of her; 'tis certain the Devil had nothing to do but to
look in her face, and upon a near steady view he might easily see there,
an instrument for his Turn; nor has he fail'd to make her a Tool ever
since, by the very methods which he at first proposed; to which,
perhaps, he has made some additions in the corrupting her composition,
as well as her understanding; qualifying her to be a compleat snare to
the poor _weaker vessel_ MAN; to wheedle him with her _Syren_'s voice,
abuse him with her smiles, delude him with her crocodile tears, and
sometimes cock her crown at him, and terrify him with the thunder of her
TREBLE; making the effeminated _Male Apple-eater_ tremble at the noise
of that very Tongue, which at first commanded him to Sin. For it is yet
a debate which the Learned have not decided, whether she persuaded and
entreated him, or like a true she-tyrant, exercised her authority and
oblig'd him to eat the forbidden fruit.

And therefore a certain author, whose name, _for fear of the Sex's
resentment_ I conceal, brings her in, calling to _Adam_ at a great
distance, in an imperious haughty manner, beckoning to him with her
hand, thus; _Here_, says she, _you cowardly faint-hearted wretch, take
this branch of heavenly fruit, eat and be a stupid fool no longer; eat
and be wise; eat and be a God; and know, to your eternal shame, that
your wife has been made an enlightn'd Goddess before you_.

He tells you _Adam_ hung back a little at first, and trembl'd, _afraid
to trespass_: _What ails the_ SOT, says the new Termagant? _what are you
afraid of? did God forbid you! yes, and why? that we might not be
knowing and wise like himself! What reason can there be that we, who
have capacious souls, able to receive knowledge, should have it
withheld? take it, you Fool, and eat; don't you see how I am exalted in
soul by it, and am quite another Creature? Take it_, I say, _or, if you
don't, I'll go and cut down the Tree, and you shall never eat any of it
at all, and you shall be still a fool, and be governed by your wife for
ever_.

Thus, if this interpretation of the thing be just, she Scolded him into
it; Rated him, and brought him to it by the terror of her voice; a thing
that has retained a dreadful influence over him ever since; nor have the
greatest of _Adam_'s Successors, how light soever some husbands make of
it in this age, been ever able, since that, to conceal their terror, at
the very Sound; nay, if we may believe history, it prevailed even among
the Gods; not all the noise of _Vulcan_'s hammers could silence the
clamours of that outrageous whore his Goddess; nay, even _Jupiter_
himself led such a life with a termagant wife, that once, they say,
_Juno_ out-scolded the noise of all his Thunders, and was within an ace
of brawling him out of Heaven. But to return to the Devil.

With these views he resolv'd, it seems, to attack the woman; and if you
consider him as a Devil, and what he aim'd at, and consider the fair
prospect he had of success, I must confess, I do not see who can blame
him, or at least, how any thing less could be expected from him; But we
shall meet with it again by and by.




CHAP. V.

_Of the station Satan had in Heaven before he fell; the nature and
     original of his crime, and some of Mr._ Milton_'s mistakes about
     it._


Thus far I have gone upon general observation, in this great affair of
_Satan_ and his Empire in the World; I now come to _my Title_, and shall
enter upon the historical part, as the main work before me.

Besides what has been said Poetically, relating to the fall and
wandering condition of the _Devil_ and his Host, which poetical part I
offer only as an excursion, and desire it should be taken so; I shall
give you what I think is deduc'd from good originals on the part of
_Satan_'s story in a few words.

He was one of the created Angels, form'd by the same omnipotent hand and
glorious power, who created the Heavens and the Earth, and all that is
therein: This innumerable heavenly host, as we have reason to believe,
contain'd Angels of higher and lower stations, of greater and of lesser
degree, express'd in the Scripture by _Thrones_, _Dominions_, and
_Principalities_: This, I think, we have as much reason to believe, as
we have, that there are Stars in the Firmament (or starry Heavens) of
greater and of lesser magnitude.

What particular station among the immortal Choir of Angels, this
Arch-seraph, this Prince of _Devils_, call'd _Satan_, was plac'd in
before his expulsion, that indeed, we cannot come at the knowledge of,
at least, not with such an Authority as may be depended upon; but as
from Scripture authority, he is plac'd at the head of all the Apostate
armies, after he was fallen, we cannot think it in the least assuming to
say, that he might be supposed to be one of the principal Agents in the
_Rebellion_ which happen'd in Heaven, and consequently that he might be
one of the highest in dignity there, before that Rebellion.

The higher his station, the lower, and with the greater precipitation,
was his overthrow; and therefore, those words, tho' taken in another
sense, may very well be apply'd to him: _How art thou fallen_, O
Lucifer! _Son of the Morning!_

Having granted the dignity of his Person, and the high station in which
he was placed among the heavenly Host; it would come then necessarily to
inquire into the nature of his fall, and _above all_, a little into the
reason of it; certain it is, _he did fall_, was guilty of Rebellion and
Disobedience, the just effect of Pride; sins, which, in that holy place,
might well be call'd wonderful.

But what to me is more wonderful, and which, I think, will be very ill
accounted for, is, how came seeds of crime to rise in the Angelic
Nature? created in a state of perfect, unspotted holiness? how was it
first found in a place where no unclean thing can enter? how came
ambition, pride, or envy to generate there? could there be offence where
there was no crime? could untainted purity breed corruption? could that
nature contaminate and infect, which was always Drinking in principles
of perfection?

Happy 'tis to me, _that_ writing the History, _not_ solving the
Difficulties of _Satan_'s Affairs, is my province in this Work; that I
am to relate the Fact, not give reasons for it, or sign causes; if it
was otherwise, I should break off at this difficulty, for I acknowledge
I do not see thro' it; neither do I think that the great _Milton_, after
all his fine Images and lofty Excursions upon the Subject, has left it
one jot clearer than he found it: Some are of opinion, and among them
the great Dr. _B----s_, that crime broke in upon them at some interval,
when they omitted but one moment fixing their eyes and thoughts on the
glories of the divine face, to admire and adore, which is the full
employment of Angels; but even this, tho' it goes as high as imagination
can carry us, does not reach it, nor, to me, make it one jot more
comprehensible than it was before; all I can say to it here, is, that
_so it was_, the fact was upon Record, and the rejected Troop are in
being, whose circumstances confess the Guilt, and still groan under the
Punishment.

If you will bear with a poetic excursion upon the subject, not to solve
but to illustrate the difficulty; take it in a few lines, thus,

  Thou sin of Witchcraft! firstborn child of Crime!
    Produc'd before the bloom of Time;
  Ambition's maiden Sin, in Heaven conceiv'd,
    And who could have believ'd
  Defilement could in purity begin,
  And bright eternal Day be soil'd with Sin?
    Tell us, sly penetrating Crime,
  How cam'st thou there, thou fault sublime?
  How didst thou pass the Adamantine Gate;
    And into Spirit thy self insinuate?
    From what dark state? from what deep place?
    From what strange uncreated race?
  Where was thy ancient habitation found
  Before void Chaos heard the forming sound?
    Wast thou a Substance, or an airy Ghost,
    A Vapour flying in the fluid waste
      Of unconcocted air?
    And how at first didst thou come there?
  Sure there was once a time when thou wert not,
  By whom wast thou created? and for what?
  Art thou a steam from some contagious damp exhal'd?
    How should contagion be intail'd,
    On bright seraphic Spirits, and in a place
  Where all's supreme, and Glory fills the Space?
    No noxious vapour there could rise,
  For there no noxious matter lies;
    Nothing that's evil could appear,
  Sin never could Seraphic Glory bear;
  The brightness of the eternal Face,
  Which fills as well as constitutes the place,
  Would be a fire too hot for crime to bear,
  'Twould calcine Sin, or melt it into air.
    How then did first defilement enter in?
  Ambition, thou first vital seed of Sin!
  Thou Life of Death, how cam'st thou there?
    In what bright form didst thou appear?
    In what Seraphic Orb didst thou arise?
  Surely that place admits of no disguise,
    Eternal Sight must know thee there,
    And being known, thou soon must disappear.
    But since the fatal Truth we know,
    Without the matter whence or manner how:
  Thou high superlative of Sin,
    Tell us thy nature, where thou didst begin?
    The first degree of thy increase,
  Debauch'd the Regions of eternal Peace,
  And fill'd the breasts of loyal Angels there
  With the first Treason and infernal War.

    Thou art the high extreme of pride,
  And dost o'er lesser crimes preside;
  Not for the mean attempt of Vice design'd,
  But to embroil the World, and damn Mankind.
  Transforming mischief, now hast thou procur'd
    That loss that ne'er to be restor'd,
  And made the bright Seraphic Morning-star
    In horrid monstrous shapes appear?
    _Satan_, that while he dwelt in glorious light,
  Was always then as pure as he was bright,
  That in effulgent rays of glory shone,
  Excell'd by eternal Light, by him alone,
  Distorted now, and stript of Innocence,
  And banish'd with thee from the high Pre-eminence,
  How has the splendid Seraph chang'd his face,
  Transform'd by thee, and like thy monstrous race?
  Ugly as is the crime, for which he fell,               }
  Fitted by thee to make a local Hell,                   }
  For such must be the place where either of you dwell.  }


Thus, as I told you, I only moralize upon the subject, but as to the
difficulty, I must leave it as I find it, unless, _as I hinted at
first_, I could prevail with Satan to set pen to paper, and write this
part of his own History: No question, but he could let us into the
secret; but to be plain, I doubt I shall tell so many plain truths of
the _Devil_, in this History, and discover so many of his secrets, which
it is not for his interest to have discover'd, that before I have done,
the _Devil_ and I may not be so good friends as you may suppose we are;
at least, not friends enough to obtain such a favour of him, tho' it be
for public good; so we must be content till we come ont' other side the
_Blue-Blanket_, and then we shall know the whole Story.

But now, tho' as I said, I will not attempt to solve the difficulty, I
may, I hope, venture to tell you, that there is not so much difficulty
in it, as at first sight appears: and especially not so much as some
people would make us believe; let us see how others are mistaken in it,
perhaps, that may help us a little in the enquiry; for to know _what it
is not_, is one help towards knowing _what it is_.

Mr. _Milton_ has indeed told us a great many merry things of the Devil,
in a most formal, solemn manner; till in short he has made a good PLAY
of _Heaven_ and _Hell_; and no doubt if he had liv'd in our times, he
might have had it acted with our _Pluto_ and _Proserpine_. He has made
fine Speeches both for _God_ and the _Devil_, and a little addition
might have turn'd it _a la modern_ into a _Harlequin Dieu & Diable_.

I confess I don't well know how far the dominion of Poetry extends
itself; it seems the Buts and Bounds of _Parnassus_ are not yet
ascertain'd; so that for ought I know, by vertue of their antient
privileges call'd _Licentia Poetarum_, there can be no _Blasphemy_ in
_Verse_; as some of our Divines say there can be no _Treason_ in the
_Pulpit_. But they that will venture to write that way, ought to be
better satisfy'd about that Point than I am.

Upon this foot Mr. _Milton_, to grace his Poem, and give room for his
Towring Fancy, has gone a length beyond all that ever went before him,
since _Ovid_ in his _Metamorphosis_. He has indeed complimented GOD
_Almighty_ with a flux of lofty words, and great sounds; and has made a
very fine Story of the _Devil_, but he has made a meer _je ne scay Quoi_
of _Jesus Christ_. In one line he has him riding on a _Cherub_, and in
another sitting on a Throne, both in the very same moment of action. In
another place he has brought him in making a Speech to his _Saints_,
when 'tis evident he had none there; for we all know _Man was not
created till a long while after_; and no body can be so dull as to say
the _Angels_ may be called _Saints_, without the greatest absurdity in
nature. Besides, he makes CHRIST himself distinguish them, as in two
several Bands, and of differing Persons and Species, as to be sure they
are.

  Stand still in bright array, _ye Saints_------
  ---- ------ -------- -------- Here stand,
  _Ye Angels_. ------

  _Par. Lost. lib._ vi. _fo._ 174.

So that CHRIST here is brought in drawing up his Army before the last
Battle, and making a Speech to them, to tell them they shall only stand
by in warlike order, but that they shall have no occasion to fight, for
he alone will engage the Rebels. Then in embattling his Legions, he
places the Saints here, and the Angels there, as if one were the main
Battle of Infantry, and the other the Wings of Cavalry. But who are
those Saints? they are indeed all of _Milton_'s own making; 'tis certain
there were no Saints at all in _Heaven_ or _Earth_ at that time; GOD and
his _Angels_ fill'd up the place; and till some of the _Angels_ fell,
and Men were created, had liv'd, and were dead, there could have been no
_Saints_ there. Saint _Abel_ was certainly the _Proto-Saint_ of all that
ever were seen in _Heaven_, as well as the Proto-martyr of all that have
been upon _Earth_.

Just such another Mistake, not to call it a Blunder, he makes about
_Hell_; which he not only makes LOCAL, but gives it a being before the
Fall of the _Angels_; and brings it in opening its mouth to receive
them. This is so contrary to the nature of the thing, and so great an
absurdity, that no Poetic License can account for it; for tho' Poesie
may form Stories, as Idea and Fancy may furnish Materials, yet Poesy
must not break in upon Chronology, and make things which in time were to
exist, act before they existed.

Thus a Painter may make a fine piece of Work, the fancy may be good, the
strokes masterly, and the beauty of the Workmanship inimitably curious
and fine, and yet have some unpardonable improprieties which marr the
whole Work. So the famous Painter of _Toledo_ painted the story of the
three Wisemen of the _East_ coming to worship, and bring their presents
to our Lord upon his birth at _Bethlehem_, where he represents them as
three _Arabian_ or _Indian_ Kings; two of them are white, and one black;
But unhappily when he drew the latter part of them kneeling, which to be
sure was done after their faces; their legs being necessarily a little
intermix'd, he made three black feet for the _Negroe_ King, and but
three white feet for the two white Kings, and yet never discover'd the
mistake till the piece was presented to the King, and hung up in the
great Church. As this is an unpardonable error in Sculpture or Limning,
it must be much more so in Poetry, where the Images must have no
improprieties, much less inconsistencies.

In a word, Mr. _Milton_ has indeed made a fine Poem, but it is _the
Devil of a History_. I can easily allow Mr. _Milton_ to make Hills and
Dales, flowry Meadows and Plains (and the like) in Heaven; and places of
Retreat and Contemplation in _Hell_; tho' I must add, that it can be
allowed to no Poet on Earth but Mr. _Milton_. Nay, I will allow Mr.
_Milton_, if you please, to set the _Angels_ a dancing in _Heaven_,
_lib._ v. _fo._ 138. and the _Devils_ a singing in Hell, _lib._ i. _fo._
44. tho' they are in short, especially the last, most horrid
Absurdities. But I cannot allow him to make their Musick in _Hell_ to be
harmonious and charming as he does; such Images being incongruous, and
indeed shocking to Nature. Neither can I think we should allow things to
be plac'd out of time in Poetry, any more than in History; 'tis a
confusion of Images which is allow'd to be disallow'd by all the
Criticks of what tribe or species soever in the world, and is indeed
unpardonable. But we shall find so many more of these things in Mr.
_Milton_, that really taking notice of them all, would carry me quite
out of my way, I being at this time not writing the History of Mr.
_Milton_, but of the _Devil_: besides, Mr. _Milton_ is such a
celebrated Man, that who but he that can write the History of the
_Devil_ dare meddle with him?

But to come back to the business. As I had caution'd you against running
to Scripture for shelter in cases of difficulty, Scripture weighing very
little among the people I am directing my Speech to; so indeed Scripture
gives but very little light into any thing of the _Devil_'s Story before
his Fall, and but _to very little_ of it for some time after.

Nor has Mr. _Milton_ said one word to solve the main difficulty (_viz._)
How the _Devil_ came to fall, and how Sin came into Heaven; how the
spotless Seraphic Nature could receive infection, whence the contagion
proceeded, what noxious matter could emit corruption there, how and
whence any vapour to poison the Angelick Frame could rise up, or how it
increas'd and grew up to crime. But all this he passes over, and
hurrying up that part in two or three words, only tells us,

                 ------ his Pride,
  Had cast him out of Heaven with all his Host
  Of rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring
  He trusted to have equal'd the most High.

  _lib._ i. _fo._ 3.

_His pride!_ but how came _Satan_ while an Arch-angel to be proud? How
did it consist, that Pride and perfect Holiness should meet in the same
Person? Here we must bid Mr. _Milton_ good night; for, in plain terms,
he is in the dark about it, and so we are all; and the most that can be
said, is, that we know the fact is so, but nothing of the nature or
reason of it.

But to come to the History: The Angels fell, they sinn'd (wonderful!) in
Heaven, and God cast them out; what their sin was is not explicit, but
in general 'tis call'd a Rebellion against GOD; all sin must be so.

Mr. _Milton_ here takes upon him to give the History of it, as
particularly as if he had been born there, and came down hither on
purpose to give us an account of it; (I hope he is better inform'd by
this time;) but this he does in such a manner, as jostles with Religion,
and shocks our Faith in so many points necessary to be believ'd, that we
must forbear to give up to Mr. _Milton_, or must set aside part of the
sacred Text, in such a manner, as will assist some people to set it all
aside.

I mean by this, his invented Scheme of the Son's being declared in
Heaven to be begotten then, and then to be declar'd Generalissimo of all
the Armies of Heaven; and of the Father's Summoning all the Angels of
the heavenly Host to submit to him, and pay him homage. The words are
quoted already, page 32.

I must own the Invention, indeed, is very fine; the Images exceeding
magnificent, the Thought rich and bright, and, in some respect, truly
sublime: But the Authorities fail most wretchedly, and the miss-timing
of it, is unsufferably gross, as is noted in the Introduction to this
Work; for Christ is not declar'd the Son of God but on Earth; 'tis true,
'tis spoken from Heaven, but then 'tis spoken as perfected on Earth; if
it was at all to be assign'd to Heaven, it was from Eternity, and there,
indeed, his eternal Generation is allow'd; but to take upon us to say,
that _On a day, a certain day_, for so our Poet assumes, lib. v. fol.
137.

        ------ 'When on a day,
          ------ 'On such a day
  'As Heaven's great Year brings forth, the empyreal Host
  'Of Angels by imperial Summons call'd,
  'Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appear'd.


This is, indeed, too gross; at this meeting he makes God declare the Son
to be _that day begotten_, as before; had he made him not begotten that
day, but declared General that day, it would be reconcileable with
Scripture and with sense; for either the begetting is meant of ordaining
to an office, or else the eternal Generation falls to the ground; and if
it was to the office (Mediator) then Mr. _Milton_ is out in ascribing
another fix'd day to the Work; see lib. x. fo. 194. But then the
declaring him _that day_, is wrong chronology too, for Christ is
declar'd _the Son of God with power_, only _by the Resurrection of the
dead_, and this is both a Declaration in Heaven and in Earth. _Rom._ i.
4. And _Milton_ can have no authority to tell us, there was any
Declaration of it in Heaven before this, except it be that dull
authority call'd _poetic License_, which will not pass in so solemn an
affair as that.

But the thing was necessary to _Milton_, who wanted to assign some cause
or original of the _Devil_'s Rebellion; and so, _as I said above_, the
design is well laid, it only wants two Trifles call'd _Truth_ and
_History_; so I leave it to struggle for itself.

This Ground-plot being laid, he has a fair field for the _Devil_ to play
the Rebel in, for he immediately brings him in, not satisfy'd with the
Exaltation of the Son of God. The case must be thus; _Satan_ being an
eminent _Arch-angel_, and perhaps, the highest of all the Angelic Train,
hearing this Sovereign Declaration, that the _Son of God_ was declar'd
to be Head or Generalissimo of all the heavenly Host, took it ill to see
another put into the high station _over his head_, as the Soldiers call
it; he, perhaps, thinking himself the senior Officer, and disdaining to
submit to any but to his former immediate Sovereign; in short, he threw
up his Commission, and, in order not to be compel'd to obey, revolted
and broke out in open Rebellion.

All this part is a Decoration noble and great, nor is there any
objection to be made against the invention, because a deduction of
probable Events; but the Plot is wrong laid, as is observ'd above,
because contradicted by the Scripture account, according to which Christ
was declared in Heaven, not then, but from Eternity, and not declared
with power, but on Earth, (_viz._) in his victory over Sin and Death, by
the Resurrection from the dead: so that Mr. _Milton_ is not orthodox in
this part, but lays an avow'd foundation for the corrupt Doctrine of
_Arius_, which says, there was a time when Christ _was not_ the Son of
GOD.

But to leave Mr. _Milton_ to his flights, I agree with him in this part,
_viz._ that the wicked or sinning Angels, with the great Arch-angel at
the head of them, revolted from their obedience, even in Heaven it self;
that _Satan_ began the wicked defection, and being a Chief among the
heavenly Host, consequently carry'd over a great party with him, who all
together rebel'd against God; that upon this Rebellion they were
sentenc'd, by the righteous judgment of GOD, to be expel'd the holy
Habitation; this, besides the authority of Scripture, we have visible
testimonies of, from the Devils themselves; their influences and
operations among us every day, of which Mankind are witnesses; in all
the merry things they do in his name, and under his protection, in
almost every scene of life they pass thro', whether we talk of things
done openly or in Masquerade, things done in--or out of it, things done
in earnest or in jest.

But then, what comes of the long and bloody War that Mr. _Milton_ gives
such a full and particular account of, and the terrible Battles in
Heaven between _Michael_ with the royal Army of Angels on one hand, and
_Satan_ with his rebel Host on the other; in which he supposes the
numbers and strength to be pretty near equal? but at length brings in
the _Devil_'s Army, upon doubling their rage and bringing new engines of
war into the field, putting _Michael_ and all the faithful Army to the
worst; and, in a word, defeats them? For tho' they were not put to a
plain flight, in which case he must, at least, have given an account of
two or three thousand millions of Angels cut in pieces and wounded, yet
he allows them to give over the fight, and make a kind of retreat; so
making way for the compleat victory of the Son of GOD: Now this is all
invention, or at least, a borrow'd thought from the old Poets, and the
Fight of the _Giants_ against _Jupiter_, so nobly design'd by _Ovid_,
almost two thousand years ago; and there 'twas well enough; but whether
Poetic Fancy should be allow'd to fable upon _Heaven_, or no, and upon
the King of Heaven too, that I leave to the Sages.

By this expulsion of the _Devils_, it is allow'd by most Authors, they
are, _ipso facto_, stript of the Rectitude and Holiness of their Nature,
which was their Beauty and Perfection; and being ingulph'd in the abyss
of irrecoverable ruin, _'tis no matter where_, from that very time they
lost their Angelic beautiful Form, commenc'd ugly frightful Monsters and
_Devils_, and became evil doers, as well as evil Spirits; fill'd with a
horrid malignity and enmity against their Maker, and arm'd with a
hellish resolution to shew and exert it on all occasions; retaining
however their exalted spirituous Nature, and having a vast extensive
power of Action, all which they can exert in nothing else but doing
evil, for they are entirely divested of either Power or will to do good;
and even in doing evil, they are under restraints and limitations of a
superior Power, which it is their Torment, and, perhaps, a great part of
their Hell that they cannot break thro'.




CHAP. VI.

_What became of the_ Devil _and his Host of fallen Spirits after their
     being expell'd from Heaven, and his wandring condition till the
     Creation; with some more of Mr._ Milton's _absurdities on that
     subject._


Having thus brought the _Devil_ and his innumerable Legions to the edge
of the Bottomless-pit, it remains, before I bring them to action, that
some enquiry should be made into the posture of their affairs
immediately after their precipitate Fall, and into the place of their
immediate Residence; for this will appear to be very necessary to
_Satan_'s History, and indeed, so as that without it, all the farther
account we have to give of him, will be inconsistent and imperfect.

And first, I take upon me to lay down some Fundamentals, which I believe
I shall be able to make out Historically, tho', perhaps, not so
Geographically as some have pretended to do.

     1. That _Satan_ was not immediately, nor is yet lock'd down into
     the Abyss of a _local Hell_, such as is supposed by some, and such
     as he shall be at last; or that,

     2. If he was, he has certain liberties allowed him for excursions
     into the Regions of this Air, and certain spheres of action, in
     which he can, and does move, to do, _like a very Devil as he is_,
     all the mischief he can, and of which we see so many examples both
     about us and in us; in the inquiry after which, I shall take
     occasion to examine whether the Devil is not in most of us,
     sometimes, if not in all of us one time or other.

     3. That _Satan_ has no particular residence in this Globe or Earth
     where we live; that he rambles about among us, and marches over and
     over our whole country, he and his Devils in _Camps volant_; but
     that he pitches his grand Army or chief Encampment in our
     Adjacencies or Frontiers, which the Philosophers call _Atmosphere_;
     and whence he is call'd the Prince of the Power of that Element or
     part of the World we call _Air_; from whence he sends out his
     Spies, his Agents and Emissaries, to get intelligence, and to carry
     his Commissions to his trusty and well beloved Cousins and
     Counsellors on Earth, by which his business is done, and his
     affairs carried on in the World.


Here, again, I meet Mr. _Milton_ full in my face, who will have it, that
_the Devil_, immediately at his expulsion, roll'd down directly into a
Hell proper and local; nay, he measures the very distance, at least
gives the length of the journey by the time they were passing or
falling, which, he says, was _nine days_; a good Poetical flight, but
neither founded on Scripture or Philosophy; he might every jot as well
have brought _Hell_ up to the Walls of _Heaven_, advanc'd to receive
them, or he ought to have consider'd the space which is to be allow'd
to any locality, let him take what part of infinite distance between
_Heaven_ and a created Hell he pleases.

But let that be as Mr. _Milton_'s extraordinary genius pleases to place
it; the passage, it seems, is just _nine days_ betwixt Heaven and Hell;
well might _Dives_ then see father _Abraham_, and talk to him too; but
then the great Gulph which _Abraham_ tells him was fix'd between them,
does not seem to be so large, as according to Sir _Isaac Newton_, Dr.
_Halley_, Mr. _Whiston_, and the rest of our Men of Science, we take it
to be.

But suppose the passage to be nine Days, according to Mr. _Milton_, what
follow'd? why Hell gap'd wide, open'd its frightful mouth, and received
them all at once; millions and thousands of millions as they were, it
received them all at a gulp, _as we call it_, they had no difficulty to
go in, no, none at all.

    _Facilis desensus averni, sed revocare gradum
  Hoc opus hic labor est._----          Virg.


All this, as Poetical, we may receive, but not at all as Historical; for
then come difficulties insuperable in our way, some of which may be as
follow: (1.) Hell is here supposed to be a place; nay a place created
for the punishment of Angels and Men, and likewise created long before
those had fallen, or these had Being; this makes me say, Mr. _Milton_
was a good Poet, but a bad Historian: _Tophet_ was prepar'd of old,
indeed, but it was for the King, that is to say, it was prepar'd for
those whose lot it should be to come there; but this does not at all
suppose it was prepar'd before it was resolv'd whether there should be
subjects for it, or no; else we must suppose both Men and Angels were
made by the glorious and upright Maker of all things, on purpose for
destruction, which would be incongruous and absurd.

But there is worse yet to come; in the next place he adds, that _Hell_
having receiv'd them, clos'd upon them; that is to say, took them in,
clos'd or shut its Mouth; and in a word, they were lock'd in, as it was
said in another place, they were lock'd in, and the Key is carry'd up to
Heaven and kept there; for _we know_ the Angel came down from Heaven,
having the Key of the Bottomless-pit; but first, see Mr. _Milton_.

  'Nine days they fell, confounded chaos roar'd
  'And felt ten-fold confusion in their fall:
                      '----Hell at last
  'Yawning receiv'd them all, and on them clos'd;
  'Down from the verge of Heaven, eternal wrath
  'Burnt after them----
  'Unquenchable.


This Scheme is certainly deficient, if not absurd, and I think is more
so than any other he has laid; 'tis evident, neither _Satan_ or his Host
of _Devils_ are, _no not any of them_, yet, even now, confin'd in the
eternal Prison, where the Scripture says, he shall be _reserved in
chains of darkness_. They must have mean thoughts of _Hell_, as a
Prison, a _local_ Confinement, that can suppose the _Devil_ able to
break Goal, knock off his Fetters, and come abroad, if he had been once
lock'd in there, as Mr. _Milton_ says he was: Now we know that he is
abroad again, he presented himself before _God_, among his neighbours,
when _Job_'s case came to be discours'd of; and more than that, it's
plain he was a prisoner at large, by his answer to God's question, which
was, _whence comest thou?_ to which he answer'd, _from going to and fro
thro' the Earth_, &c. this, I say, is plain, and if it be as certain
that Hell closed upon them, I demand then, how got he out? and why was
there not a Proclamation for apprehending him, as there usually is,
after such Rogues as break prison?

In short, the true Account of the _Devil_'s Circumstances, since his
Fall from _Heaven_, is much more likely to be thus: That he is more of a
Vagrant than a Prisoner, that he is a Wanderer in the wild unbounded
Wast, where he and his Legions, like the Hoords of _Tartary_, who, in
the wild Countries of _Karakathay_, the Desarts of _Barkan_, _Kassan_,
and _Astracan_, live up and down where they find proper; so Satan and
his innumerable Legions rove about _hic & ubique_, pitching their Camps
(being Beasts of prey) where they find the most Spoil; watching over
this World, (and all the other Worlds for ought we know, and if there
are any such,) I say watching, and seeking who they may devour, _that
is_, who they may deceive and delude, and so destroy, for devour they
cannot.

_Satan_ being thus confin'd to a vagabond, wandring, unsettl'd
Condition, is without any certain Abode; For tho' he has, in consequence
of his Angelic Nature, a kind of Empire in the liquid Wast or _Air_;
yet, this is certainly part of his punishment, that he is continually
hovering over this inhabited Globe of Earth; swelling with the Rage of
Envy, at the Felicity of his Rival, Man; and studying all the means
possible to injure and ruin him; but extremely limited in Power, to his
unspeakable Mortification: This is his present State, without any fix'd
Abode, Place, or Space, allow'd him to rest the Sole of his Foot upon.

From his Expulsion, I take his first View of Horror to be that, of
looking back towards the Heaven which he had lost; there to see the
Chasm or Opening made up, out at which, as at a Breach in the Wall of
the holy Place, he was thrust Head-long by the Power which expel'd him;
I say, to see the Breach repair'd, the Mounds built up, the Walls
garison'd with millions of Angels, and arm'd with Thunders; and, above
all, made terrible by that Glory from whose Presence they were expel'd,
as is Poetically hinted at before.

Upon this sight, 'tis no wonder (if there was such a Place) that they
fled till the Darkness might cover them, and that they might be out of
the View of so hated a Sight.

Wherever they found it, you may be sure they pitch'd their first Camp,
and began, after many a sour Reflection upon what was pass'd, to
consider and think a little, upon what was to come.

If I had as much personal Acquaintance with the _Devil_, as would admit
it, and could depend upon the Truth of what Answer he would give me, the
first Question I would ask him, should be, what Measures they resolv'd
on at their first Assembly? and the next should be, how they were
employ'd in all that space of Time, between their so flying the Face of
their almighty Conqueror, and the Creation of Man? as for the Length of
the Time, which, according to the Learn'd, was twenty thousand Years,
and according to the more Learned, not half a Quarter so much, I would
not concern my Curiosity much about it; 'tis most certain, there was a
considerable time between, but of that immediately; first let me enquire
what they were doing all that time.

The Devil and his Host, being thus, I say, cast out of Heaven, and not
yet confin'd strictly to _Hell_, 'tis plain they must be _some where_.
Satan and all his Legions did not lose their Existence, no, nor the
Existence of _Devils_ neither; GOD was so far from annihilating him,
that he still preserv'd his Being; and this not Mr. _Milton_ only, but
GOD himself has made known to us, having left his History so far upon
record; several expressions in Scripture also make it evident, as
particularly the story of _Job_, mentioned before; the like in our
Saviour's time, and several others.

If Hell did not immediately ingulph them, as _Milton_ suggests, 'tis
certain, I say, that they fled Somewhere, from the anger of Heaven, from
the face of the Avenger; and his absence, and their own guilt, _wonder
not at it_, would make Hell enough for them wherever they went.

Nor need we fly to the Dreams of our _Astronomers_, who take a great
deal of pains to fill up the vast Spaces of the starry Heavens with
innumerable habitable Worlds; allowing as many _solar Systems_ as there
are fix'd Stars, and that not only in the known Constellations, but even
in _Gallaxie_ it self; who, to every such System allow a certain number
of Planets, and to every one of those Planets so many _Satellites_ or
_Moons_, and all these Planets and Moons to be Worlds; solid, dark,
opaque Bodies, habitable, and (as they would have us believe) inhabited
by the like Animals and rational Creatures as on this Earth; so that
they may, at this rate, find room enough for the _Devil_ and all his
Angels, without making a Hell on purpose; nay they may, for ought I
know, find a World for every _Devil_ in all the _Devil'_s _Host_, and so
every one may be a Monarch or _Master-Devil_, separately in his own
Sphere or World, and play the _Devil_ there by himself.

And even if this were so, it cannot be denied but that one _Devil_ in a
place would be enough for a whole systemary World, and be able, if not
restrained, to do mischief enough there too, and even to ruin and
overthrow the whole body of People contain'd in it.

But, I say, we need not fly to these shifts, or consult the Astronomers
in the decision of this point; for wherever _Satan_ and his defeated
Host went, at their expulsion from _Heaven_, we think we are certain,
none of all these Beautiful Worlds, or be they Worlds or no, I mean the
fix'd Stars, Planets, _&c._ had then any existence; for the Beginning,
as the Scripture calls it, was not yet Begun.

But to speak a little by the rules of Philosophy, that is to say, so as
to be understood by others, even when we speak of things we cannot fully
understand ourselves: Tho' in the Beginning of Time all this glorious
Creation was form'd, the Earth, the starry Heavens, and all the
Furniture thereof, and there was a Time when they were not; yet we
cannot say so of the Void, or that nameless _no-where_, as I call'd it
before, which now appears to be a _some-where_, in which these glorious
Bodies are plac'd. That immense Space which those take up, and which
they move in at this Time, must be supposed, before they had Being, to
be plac'd there: As God himself was, and existed before all Being, Time,
or Place, so the Heaven of Heavens, or the Place, where the Thrones and
Dominions of his Kingdom then existed, inconceivable and ineffable, had
an existence before the glorious Seraphs, the innumerable company of
Angels which attended about the Throne of God existed; these all had a
Being long before, as the Eternal Creator of them all had before them.

Into this void or abyss of Nothing, however unmeasurable, infinite, and
even to those Spirits, themselves Inconceivable, they certainly launch'd
from the bright Precipice which they fell from, and here they shifted as
well as they could.

Here expanding those Wings which Fear, and Horror at their Defeat
furnish'd them, as I hinted before, they hurried away to the utmost
Distance possible, from the Face of GOD their Conqueror, and then most
dreaded Enemy; formerly their Joy and Glory.

Be this utmost remov'd Distance _where it will_, Here, certainly,
_Satan_ and all his _Gang of Devils_, his numberless, tho' routed Armies
retired. Here _Milton_ might, with some good Ground, have form'd his
_Pandemonium_, and have brought them in, consulting what was next to be
done, and whether there was any room left to renew the War, or to carry
on the Rebellion; but had they been cast immediately into _Hell_, closed
up there, the Bottomless pit lock'd upon them, and the Key carried up to
_Heaven_ to be kept there, as Mr. _Milton_ himself in part confesses,
and the Scripture affirms; I say, had this been so, the _Devil_ himself
could not have been so ignorant as to think of any future Steps to be
taken, to retrieve his Affairs, and therefore a _Pandemonium_ or Divan
in Hell, to consult of it, was ridiculous.

All Mr. _Milton_'s Scheme of _Satan_'s future Conduct, and all the
Scripture Expressions about _the Devil_ and his numerous Attendants, and
of his actings since that time, make it not reasonable to suggest that
the _Devils_ were confin'd to their eternal Prison, at their Expulsion
out of _Heaven_; But that they were in a State of Liberty to act, tho'
limited in acting, of which I shall also speak in its place.




CHAP. VII.

_Of the Number of Satan's Host; how they came first to know of the new
     created Worlds, now in being, and their Measures with Mankind upon
     the Discovery._


Several things have been suggested to set us a calculating the number of
this frightful throng of _Devils_, who with Satan, the _Master-Devil_,
was thus cast out of _Heaven_; I cannot say, I am so much Master of
Political Arithmetick as to cast up the Number of the Beast, no, nor the
Number of the Beasts _or Devils_, who make up this Throng. St.
_Francis_, they tell us, or some other Saint, they do not say who, ask'd
the _Devil_ once, how strong he was? for St. _Francis_, you must know,
was very familiar with him; _The Devil_, it seems, did not ttriumph'd openly, and
having set up a Murtherer upon the temporal Throne, and a Church Emperor
upon the Ecclesiastic Throne, and both of his own choosing, the _Devil_
may be said to begin his new Kingdom from this Epocha, and call it the
_Restoration_.

Since this time indeed the Devil's Affairs went very merrily on, and the
Clergy brought so many Gewgaws into their Worship, and such devilish
Principles were mixt with that which we call'd the Christian Faith, that
in a Word, from this Time the Bishop of _Rome_ commenc'd _Whore of
Babylon_, in all the most express Terms that could be imagin'd: Tyranny
of the worst sort crept into the Pontificate, Errors of all sorts into
the Profession, and they proceeded from one thing to another, till the
very Popes, for so the Bishop of _Rome_ was now called, by way of
Distinction; I say, the Popes themselves, their spiritual Guides,
profess'd openly to confederate with the _Devil_, and to carry on a
personal and private Correspondence with him at the same time, taking
upon them the Title of Christ's Vicar, and the infallible Guide of the
Consciences of Christians.

This we have sundry Instances of in some merry Popes, who, _if Fame lies
not_, were Sorcerers, Magicians, had familiar Spirits, and immediate
Conversation with the Devil, as well visibly as invisibly, and by this
means became what we call _Devils incarnate_: Upon this account it is
that I have left the Conversation that passes between _Devils and Men_
to this Place, as well because I believe it differs much now in his
modern State, from what it was in his ancient State, and therefore that
which most concerns us belongs rather to this part of his History; as
also because, as I am now writing to the present Age, I choose to bring
the most significant Parts of his History, especially as they relate to
our selves, into that Part of Time that we are most concern'd in.

The _Devil_ had once, as I observ'd before, the universal Monarchy or
Government of Mankind in himself, and I doubt not but in that
flourishing State of his Affairs, he governed them like what he is
(_viz._) an absolute Tyrant; during this _Theocracy_ of his, _for_ Satan
_is call'd the God of this World_, he did not familiarize himself to
Mankind so much, as he finds Occasion to do now, there was not then so
much need of it; he governed then with an absolute Sway; he had his
Oracles, where he gave Audience to his Votaries like a Deity, and he had
his Sub-Gods, who under his several Dispositions receiv'd the Homage of
Mankind in their Names; such were all the Rabble of the Heathen Deities,
from _Jupiter_ the Supreme, to the _Lares_ or Houshold Gods of every
Family; these, I say, like Residents, received the Prostrations, but the
Homage was all Satan's; the Devil had the Substance of it all, which was
the Idolatry.

During this Administration of _Hell_, there was less Witchcraft, less
true literal Magick than there has been since; there was indeed no need
of it, the DEVIL did not stoop to the Mechanism of his more modern
Operations, but rul'd as a Deity, and receiv'd the Vows and the Bows of
his Subjects in more State, and with more Solemnity; whereas since that,
he is content to employ more Agents and take more Pains himself too; now
he runs up and down Hackney in the World, more like a Drudge than a
Prince, and much more than he did then.

Hence all those Things we call Apparitions and Visions of Ghosts,
Familiar-Spirits and Dealings with the Devil, of which there is so great
a Variety in the World at this Time, were not so much known among the
People, in those first Ages of the Devil's Kingdom; _in a Word_, the
Devil seems to be put to his Shifts, and to fly to Art and Stratagem for
the carrying on his Affairs, much more now than he did then.

One Reason for this may be, that he has been more discover'd and expos'd
in these Ages, than he was before; then he could appear in the World in
his own proper Shapes, and yet not be known; when the Sons of GOD
appear'd at the divine Summons, Satan came along with them; but now he
has plaid so many scurvy Tricks upon Men, and they know him so well,
that he is oblig'd to play quite out of sight and act in disguise;
Mankind will allow nothing of his doing, and hear nothing of his saying,
in his own Name; and if you propose any Thing to be done, and it be but
said the _Devil_ is to help in the doing it, or if you say of any Man he
deals with the _Devil_, or the _Devil_ has a Hand in it, every Body
flies him and shuns him, as the most frightful Thing in the World.

Nay, if any Thing strange and improbable be done or related to be done,
we presently say the _Devil_ was at the doing it: Thus the great Ditch
at _Newmarket Heath_, is call'd the _Devil_'s _Ditch_; so the _Devil_
built _Crowland_ Abby, and the Whispering-Place in _Gloucester_
Cathedral; nay, the Cave at _Castleton_, only because there's no getting
to the farther End of it, is call'd the _Devil_'s A---- and the like:
The poor People of _Wiltshire_, when you ask them how the great Stones
at _Stonehenge_ were brought thither? they'll all tell you the _Devil_
brought them: If any Mischief extraordinary befalls us, we presently say
the _Devil_ was in it, and the _Devil_ would have it so; in a Word, the
_Devil_ has got an ill Name among us, and so he is fain to act more _in
Tenebris_, more _incog._ than he used to do, play out of sight himself,
and work by the Sap, as the Engineers call it, and not openly and
avowedly in his own Name and Person, as formerly, tho' perhaps not with
less Success than he did before; and this leads me to enquire more
narrowly into the manner of the _Devil_'s Management of his Affairs
since the Christian Religion began to spread in the World, which
manifestly differs from his Conduct in more antient Times; in which if
we discover some of the most consummate Fool's Policy, the most profound
simple Craft, and the most subtle shallow Management of Things that can
by our weak Understandings be conceiv'd, we must only resolve it into
this, that in short it is the DEVIL.




CHAP. II.

_Of Hell as it is represented to us, and how the_ Devil _is to be
     understood, as being personally in Hell, when at the same Time we
     find him at Liberty ranging over the World._


It is true, as that learn'd and pleasant Author, the inimitable Dr.
_Brown_ says, the _Devil_ is his own Hell; one of the most constituting
Parts of his Infelicity is, that he cannot act upon Mankind _brevi
Manu_, by his own inherent Power, as well as Rage; that he cannot
unhinge this Creation, which, _as I have observ'd in its Place_, he had
the utmost Aversion to from its Beginning, as it was a stated Design in
the Creator to supply his Place in Heaven with a new Species of _Beings_
call'd _Man_, and fill the Vacancies occasion'd by his Degeneracy and
Rebellion.

This fill'd him with Rage inexpressible, and horrible Resolutions of
Revenge, and the Impossibility of executing those Resolutions torments
him with Despair; this added to what he was before, makes him a compleat
_Devil_, with a Hell in his own Breast, and a Fire unquenchable burning
about his Heart.

I might enlarge here, and very much to the Purpose, in describing
spherically and mathematically that exquisite Quality call'd _a devilish
Spirit_, in which it would naturally occur to give you a whole Chapter
upon the glorious Articles of _Malice_ and _Envy_, and especially upon
that luscious, delightful, triumphant Passion call'd REVENGE; how
natural to Man, nay even to both Sexes; how pleasant in the very
Contemplation, tho' there be not just at that Time a Power of
Execution; how palatable it is in it self, and how well it relishes when
dish'd up with its proper Sauces, such as Plot, Contrivance, Scheme, and
Confederacy, all leading on to Execution: How it possesses a human Soul
in all the most sensible Parts; how it empowers Mankind to sin in
Imagination, as effectually to all future Intents and Purposes
(Damnation) as if he had sinned actually: How safe a Practice it is too,
as to Punishment in this Life, namely, that it empowers us to cut
Throats clear of the Gallows, to slander Virtue, reproach Innocence,
wound Honour and stab Reputation; and in a Word, to do all the wicked
Things in the World, out of the Reach of the Law.

It would also require some few Words to describe the secret Operations
of those nice Qualities when they reach the human Soul; how effectually
they form a Hell within us, and how imperceptibly they assimilate and
transform us into _Devils_, meer human Devils, as really _Devils_ as
Satan himself, or any of his Angels; and that therefore 'tis not so much
out of the Way, as some imagine, to say, such a Man is an _incarnate_
Devil; for as Crime made Satan a _Devil_, who was before a bright
immortal Seraph, or Angel of Light; how much more easily may the same
Crime make _the same_ DEVIL, tho' every Way meaner and more
contemptible, _of a Man or_ a Woman either? But this is too grave a
Subject for me at this Time.

The _Devil_ being thus, I say, fir'd with Rage and Envy, in consequence
of his Jealousy upon the Creation of Man, his Torment is encreased to
the highest by the Limitation of his Power, and his being forbid to act
against Mankind by Force of Arms; this is, I say, part of his _Hell_,
which, as above, is within him, and which he carries with him wherever
he goes; nor is it so difficult to conceive of _Hell_, or of the
_Devil_, either under this just Description, as it is by all the usual
Notions that we are taught to entertain of them, by (the old Women) our
Instructors; for every Man may, by taking but a common View of himself,
and making a just Scrutiny into his own Passions, on some of their
particular Excursions, see a _Hell_ within himself, and himself a meer
_Devil_ as long as the Inflammation lasts; and that as really, and to
all Intents and Purposes, as if he had the Angel (_Satan_) before his
Face, in his Locality and Personality; that is to say, all Devil and
Monster in his Person, and an immaterial but intense Fire flaming about
and from within him, at all the Pores of his Body.

The Notions we receive of the Devil, _as a Person_ being in Hell _as a
Place_, are infinitely absurd and ridiculous; the first we are certain
is not true in Fact, because he has a certain Liberty, (_however
limited_ that is not to the Purpose) is daily visible, and to be trac'd
in his several Attacks upon Mankind, and has been so ever since his
first Appearance in _Paradise_; as to his corporal Visibility that is
not the present Question neither; 'tis enough that we can hunt him by
the Foot, that we can follow him as Hounds do a Fox upon a hot Scent: We
can see him as plainly by the Effect, by the Mischief he does, and more
by the Mischief he puts us upon doing, _I say_, as plainly, as if we saw
him by the Eye.

It is not to be doubted but the _Devil_ can see us when and where we
cannot see him: and as he has a Personality, tho' it be spirituous, he
and his Angels too may be reasonably supposed to inhabit the World of
Spirits, and to have free Access from thence to the Regions of Life, and
to pass and repass in the Air, as really, tho' not perceptible to us,
as the Spirits of Men do after their release from the Body, pass to the
Place (wherever that is) which is appointed for them.

If the _Devil_ was confin'd to a Place (_Hell_) as a Prison, he could
then have no Business here; and if we pretend to describe _Hell_, as not
a Prison, but that the Devil has Liberty to be there, or not be there as
he pleased, then he would certainly never be there, or _Hell_ is not
such a Place as we are taught to understand it to be.

Indeed according to some, _Hell_ should be a Place of Fire and Torment
to the Souls that are cast into it, but not to the _Devils_ themselves;
who we make little more or less than keepers and Turnkeys to Hell, as a
Goal; that they are sent about to bring Souls thither, lock them in when
they come, and then away upon the Scent to fetch more: That one Sort of
_Devils_ are made to live in the World among Men, and to be busy
continually debauching and deluding Mankind bringing them as it were to
the Gates of _Hell_; and then another Sort are Porters and Carriers to
fetch them in.

This is, _in short_, little more or less than the old Story of _Pluto_,
of _Cerberus_, and of _Charon_; only that our Tale is not half so well
told, nor the Parts of the Fable so well laid together.

In all these Notions of _Hell_ and _Devil_, the Torments of the first,
and the Agency of the last Tormenting, we meet with not one Word of the
main and perhaps only Accent of Horror, which belongs to us to judge of
about Hell, I mean the Absence of Heaven; Expulsion, and Exclusion from
the Presence and Face of the chief Ultimate, the only eternal and
sufficient Good; and this loss sustain'd by a sordid Neglect of our
Concern in that excellent Part, in exchange for the most contemptible
and justly condemn'd Trifles, and all this eternal and irrecoverable:
These People tell us nothing of the eternal Reproaches of Conscience,
the Horror of Desperation, and the Anguish of a Mind hopeless of ever
seeing the Glory, which alone constitutes Heaven, and which makes all
other Places dreadful, and even Darkness it self.

And this brings me directly to the Point in Hand, (_viz._) the State of
that Hell which we ought to have in view when we speak of the _Devil_ as
_in Hell_: This is the very Hell, which is the Torment of the _Devil_;
in short, the _Devil_ is in HELL, and HELL is in the _Devil_; he is
fill'd with this unquenchable Fire, he is expel'd the Place of Glory,
banish'd from the Regions of Light, Absence from the Life of all
Beatitude is his Curse, Despair is the reigning Passion in his Mind, and
all the little Constituent Parts of his Torment, such as Rage, Envy,
Malice, and Jealousy are consolidated in this, to make his Misery
compleat, (_viz._) the Duration of it all, the Eternity of his
Condition; that he is without Hope, without Redemption, without
Recovery.

If any thing can inflame this _Hell_ and make it hotter, 'tis this only,
and this does add an inexpressible Horror to the Devil himself;
_namely_, the seeing Man (the only Creature he hates) placed in a State
of Recovery, a glorious Establishment of Redemption form'd for him in
Heaven, and the Scheme of it perfected on Earth; by which _this Man_,
tho' even the _Devil_ by his Art may have deluded him, and drawn him
into Crime, is yet in a State of Recovery, which the Devil is not; and
that it is not in his (_Satan_'s) Power to prevent it: Now take the
Devil as he is in his own Nature Angelic, a bright immortal Seraph,
Heaven-born, and having tasted the eternal Beatitude, which these are
appointed to enjoy; the Loss of that State to himself, the Possession
of it granted to his Rival tho' wicked like and as himself; I say, take
the Devil as he is, having a quick Sense of his own Perdition, and a
stinging Sight of his Rival's Felicity, 'tis _Hell enough_, and more
than enough, even for an Angel to support; nothing we can conceive can
be worse.

As to any other Fire than this, such and so immaterially intense as to
Torment a Spirit, which is it self Fire also; I will not say it cannot
be, because to Infinite every Thing is possible, but I must say, I
cannot conceive rightly of it.

I will not enter here into the Wisdom or Reasonableness of representing
the Torments of Hell to be Fire, and that Fire to be a Commixture of
_Flame_ and _Sulphur_; it has pleased God to let the Horror of those
eternal Agonies about _a lost Heaven_, be laid before us by those
Similitudes or Allegories, which are most moving to our Senses and to
our Understandings; nor will I dispute the Possibility; much less will I
doubt but that there is to be a Consummation of Misery to all the
Objects of Misery when the _Devil_'s Kingdom in this World ending with
the World it self, that Liberty he has now may be farther abridg'd; when
he may be return'd to the same State he was in between the Time of his
Fall and the Creation of the World; with perhaps some additional
Vengeance on him, such as at present we cannot describe, for all that
Treason and those high Crimes and Misdemeanours which he has been guilty
of here, in his Conversation with Mankind.

As his Infelicity will be then consummated and compleated, so the
Infelicity of that Part of Mankind, who are condemn'd with him, may
receive a considerable Addition from those Words in their Sentence, to
be tormented _with the Devil and his Angels_; for as the Absence of the
Supreme Good is a compleat Hell, so the hated Company of the Deceiver,
who was the great Cause of his Ruine, must be a Subject of additional
Horror, and he will be always saying, as a _Scots_ Gentleman, who died
of his Excesses, said to the famous Dr. _P----_, who came to see him on
his Death-bed, but had been too much his Companion in his Life,

  _O tu fundamenta jecisti------_


I would not treat the very Subject it self with any Indecency, nor do I
think my Opinion of that _Hell_, which I say consists in the Absence of
him, in whom is Heaven, one Jot less Solemn than theirs who believe it
all _Fire_ and _Brimstone_; but I must own, that to me nothing can be
more ridiculous than the Notions that we entertain and fill our Heads
with about _Hell_, and about the _Devil_'s being there tormenting of
Souls, broiling them upon Gridirons, hanging them up upon Hooks,
carrying them upon their Backs, and the like, with the several Pictures
of _Hell_, represented by a great Mouth with horrible Teeth, gaping like
a Cave on the Sides of a Mountain; suppose that appropriated to _Satan_
in the _Peak_, which indeed is not much unlike it, with a Stream of Fire
coming out of it, as there is of Water, and smaller Devils going and
coming continually in and out, to fetch and carry Souls the Lord knows
whither, and for the Lord knows what.

These Things, however intended for Terror, are indeed so ridiculous,
that the _Devil_ himself, to be sure, mocks at them, and a Man of Sense
can hardly refrain doing the like, only I avoid it, because I would not
give offence to weaker Heads.

However, I must not Compliment the Brains of other Men, at the Expence
of my own, or talk Nonsense because they can understand no other; I
think all these Notions and Representations of _Hell_ and of the
_Devil_, to be as prophane as they are ridiculous, and I ought no more
to talk prophanely than merrily of them.

Let us learn to talk of these Things then, as we should do; and as we
really cannot describe them to our Reason and Understanding, why should
we describe them to our Senses; we had, I think, much better not
describe them at all, that is to say, not attempt it: The blessed
Apostle St. _Paul_ was, as he said himself, carried up, or caught up
into the _third Heaven_, yet when he came down again, he could neither
tell what he heard or describe what he saw; all he could say of it was,
that what he heard was _inutterable_, and what he saw was
_inconceivable_.

It is the same thing as to the State of the _Devil_ in those Regions
which he now possesses, and where he now more particularly inhabits; my
present Business then is not to enter into those grave Things so as to
make them ridiculous, as I think most People do that talk of them; but
as the _Devil_, let his Residence be where it will, has evidently free
Leave to come and go, not into this World only; (_I mean, the Region of
our Atmosphere_,) but for ought we know, to all the other inhabited
Worlds which God has made, where-ever they are, and by whatsoever Names
they are or may be known or distinguished; for if he is not confined in
one Place, we have no Reason to believe he is excluded from any Place,
Heaven only excepted, from whence he was expell'd for his Treason and
Rebellion.

His Liberty then being thus ascertain'd, three Things seem to be
material for us to give an Account of, in order to form this Part of
his History.

     1. What his Business is on this Globe of Earth which we vulgarly
     call the World, how he acts among us, what Affairs Mankind and he
     have together, and how far his Conduct here relates to Us, and Ours
     is, or may be influenc'd by him.

     2. Where his Principal Residence is, and whether he has not a
     particular Empire of his own, to which he retreats upon proper
     Occasions; where he entertains his Friends when they come under his
     particular Administration; and where, when he gets any Victory over
     his Enemies, he carries his Prisoners of War.

     3. What may probably be the great Business this black Emperor has
     at present upon his Hands, either in this World or out of it, and
     by what Agents he works.


As these Things may perhaps run promiscuously thro' the Course of this
whole Work, and frequently be touch'd at under other Branches of the
_Devil_'s History, so I do not propose them as Heads of Chapters or
Particular Sections, for the Order of Discourse to be handled apart; for
(by the way) as Satan's Actings have not been the most regular Things in
the World, so in our Discourse about him, it must not be expected that
we can always tie our selves down to Order and Regularity, either as to
Time, or Place, or Persons; for Satan being _hic & ubique_, a loose
ungovern'd Fellow, we must be content to trace him where we can find
him.

It is true, in the foregoing Chapter, I shew'd you the DEVIL entred into
the Herd Ecclesiastick, and gave you some Account of the first
successful Step he took with Mankind since the Christian Epocha; how
having secretly managed both Temporal and Spiritual Power apart, and by
themselves, he now united them in Point of Management, and brought the
Church Usurpation and the Army's Usurpation together; the Pope to bless
the General in deposing and murthering his Master the Emperor; and the
General to recognise the Pope in dethroning his Master Christ Jesus.

From this time forward you are to allow the _Devil_ a mystical Empire in
this World; not an Action of Moment done without him, not a Treason but
he has a Hand in it, not a Tyrant but he prompts him, not a Government
but he has a ---- in it; not a Fool but he tickles him, not a Knave but
he guides him; he has a Finger in every Fraud, a Key to every Cabinet,
from the _Divan_ at _Constantinople_, to the _Mississipi_ in _France_,
and to the _South-Sea_ Cheats at ------; from the first Attack upon the
Christian World, in the Person of the _Romish_ Antichrist, down to the
Bull _Unigenitus_; and from the Mixture of St. _Peter_ and _Confucius_
in _China_, to the Holy Office in _Spain_; and down to the _Emlins_ and
_Dodwells_ of the current Age.

How he has managed, and does manage, and how in all Probability he will
manage till his Kingdom shall come to a Period, and how at last he will
probably be managed himself, _Enquire within, and you shall know
farther_.




CHAP. III.

_Of the Manner of_ Satan_'s acting and carrying on his Affairs in this
     World, and particularly of his ordinary Workings in the dark, by_
     Possession _and_ Agitation.


The Devil being thus reduc'd to act upon Mankind by Stratagem only, it
remains to enquire how he performs, and which way he directs his
Attacks; the Faculties of Man are a kind of a Garrison in a strong
Castle, which as they defend it on the one hand under the Command of the
reasoning Power of Man's Soul, so they are prescribed on the other hand,
and can't sally out without Leave; for the Governor of a Fort does not
permit his Soldiers to hold any Correspondence with the Enemy, without
special Order and Direction. Now the great Enquiry before us is, How
comes the DEVIL to a Parley with us? how does he converse with our
Senses, and with the Understanding? How does he reach us, which way does
he come at the Affections, and which way does he move the Passions? 'Tis
a little difficult to discover this treasonable Correspondence, and that
Difficulty is indeed the _Devil_'s Advantage, and, for ought I see, the
chief Advantage he has over Mankind.

It is also a great Enquiry here, whether the _Devil_ knows our Thoughts
or no? If I may give my Opinion, I am with the negative; I deny that he
knows any thing of our Thoughts, except of those Thoughts which he puts
us upon thinking, for I will not doubt but he has the Art to inject
Thoughts, and to revive dormant Thoughts in us: It is not so wild a
Scheme as some take it to be, that Mr. _Milton_ lays down, to represent
the _Devil_ injecting corrupt Desires and wandring Thoughts into the
Head of _Eve_, by Dreams, and that he brought her to Dream whatever he
put into her Thoughts, by whispering to her vocally when she was asleep;
and to this End, he imagines the DEVIL laying himself close to her Ear,
in the Shape of a Toad, when she was fall asleep; I say, this is not so
wild a Scheme, seeing even now, if you can whisper any thing close to
the Ear of a Person in a deep Sleep, so as to speak distinctly to the
Person, and yet not awaken him, as has been frequently tried, the Person
sleeping shall dream distinctly of what you say to him; nay, shall dream
the very Words you say.

We have then no more to ask, but how the DEVIL can convey himself to the
Ear of a sleeping Person, and it is granted then that he may have Power
to make us dream what he pleases: But this is not all, for if he can so
forcibly, by his invisible Application, cause us to dream, what he
pleases, why can he not with the same Facility prompt our Thoughts,
whether sleeping or waking? To dream, is nothing else but to think
sleeping; and we have abundance of deep-headed Gentlemen among us, who
give us ample Testimony that they dream waking.

But if the DEVIL can prompt us to dream, that is to say, to think, yet
if he does not know our Thoughts, how then can he tell whether the
Whisper had its Effect? The answer is plain, the DEVIL, like the Angler,
baits the Hook, if the Fish bite he lies ready to take the Advantage, he
whispers to the Imagination, and then waits to see how it works; as
_Naomi_ said to _Ruth_, Chap. iii. 5, 18. _Sit still, my Daughter, until
thou know how the Matter will fall, for the Man will not be at rest
until he have finished the thing._ Thus when the DEVIL had whisper'd to
_Eve_ in her Sleep, _according to Milton_, and suggested Mischief to her
Imagination, he only sat still to see how the Matter would work, for he
knew if it took with her, he should hear more of it; and then by finding
her alone the next Day, without her ordinary Guard her Husband, he
presently concluded she had swallowed the Bait, and so attack'd her
afresh.

A small deal of Craft, and less by far than we have reason to believe
the _Devil_ is Master of, will serve to discover whether such and such
Thoughts as he knows he has suggested, have taken Place or no; the
Action of the Person presently discovers it, at least to him that lies
always upon the Watch, and has every Word, every Gesture, every Step we
take subsequent to his Operation, open to him; it may therefore, for
ought we know, be a great Mistake, and what most of us are guilty of, to
tell our Dreams to one another in the Morning, after we have been
disturb'd with them in the Night; for if the _Devil_ converses with us
so insensibly as some are of the Opinion he does, _that is to say_, if
he can hear as far as we can see, we may be telling our Story to him
indeed, when we think we are only talking to one another.

This brings me most naturally to the important Enquiry, whether the
_Devil_ can walk about the World invisibly or no? The Truth is, this is
no question to me; for as I have taken away his Visibility already, and
have denied him all Prescience of Futurity too, and have prov'd he
cannot know our Thoughts, nor put any Force upon Persons or Actions, if
we should take away his Invisibility too, we should _undevil_ him quite,
to all Intents and Purposes, as to any Mischief he could do; nay, it
would banish him the World, and he might e'en go and seek his Fortune
some where else; for if he could neither be visible or invisible,
neither act in publick or in private, he could neither have Business or
Being in this Sphere, nor could we be any way concern'd with him.

The _Devil_ therefore most certainly has a Power and Liberty of moving
about in this World, after _some manner or another_; this is verify'd as
well by way of Allegory, as by way of History, in the Scripture it self;
and as the first strongly suggests and supposes it to be so, the last
positively asserts it; and, not to croud this Work with Quotations from
a Book which we have not much to do with in the _Devil_'s Story, at
least not much to his Satisfaction, I only hint his personal Appearance
to our Saviour in the Wilderness, where it is said, _the Devil taketh
him up to an exceeding high Mountain_; and in another Place, _the Devil
departed from him_. What Shape or Figure he appear'd in, we do not find
mentioned, but I cannot doubt his appearing to him there, any more than
I can his talking to our Saviour in the Mouths, and with the Voices of
the several Persons who were under the terrible Affliction of an actual
Possession.

These Things leave us no room to doubt of what is advanced above,
namely, that he, (the _Devil_) has a certain Residence, or Liberty of
residing in, and moving about upon the Surface of this Earth, as well as
in the Compass of the Atmosphere, vulgarly call'd the Air, in some
manner or other: That is the general.

It remains to enquire into the manner, which I resolve into two Kinds;

     1. _Ordinary_, which I suppose to be his invisible Motions as a
     Spirit; under which Consideration I suppose him to have an
     unconfin'd, unlimited, unrestrain'd Liberty, as to the manner of
     acting; and this either in Persons, by Possession; or in Things, by
     Agitation.

     2. _Extraordinary_; which I understand to be his Appearances in
     borrowed Shapes and Bodies, or Shadows rather of Bodies; assuming
     Speech, Figure, Posture, and Several Powers, of which we can give
     little or no Account; in which extraordinary manner of Appearances,
     he is either limited by a Superior Power, or limits himself
     politically, as being not the Way most for his Interest or Purpose,
     to act in his Business, which is more effectually done in his State
     of Obscurity.


Hence we must suppose the _Devil_ has it very much in his own Choice,
whether to act in one Capacity, or in the other, or in both; that is to
say, of appearing, and not appearing, as he finds for his Purpose: In
this State of Invisibility, and under the Operation of these Powers and
Liberties, he performs all his Functions and Offices, as _Devil_, as
Prince of Darkness, as God of this World, as Tempter, Accuser, Deceiver,
and all whatsoever other Names of Office, or Titles of Honour he is
known by.

Now taking him in this large unlimited, or little limited State of
Action, he is well call'd, _the God of this World_, for he has very much
of the Attribute of Omnipresence, and may be said, _either by himself or
his Agents_, to be every where, and see every thing; that is to say,
every thing that is visible; for I cannot allow him any Share of
_Omniscience_ at all.

That he ranges about every where, is _with us_, and sometimes _in us_,
sees when he is not seen, hears when he is not heard, comes in without
Leave, and goes out without Noise, is neither to be shut in or shut out,
that when he runs _from us_ we can't catch him, and when he runs _after
us_ we can't escape him, is seen when he is not known, and is known when
he is not seen; all these things, and more, we have Knowledge enough
about to convince us of the Truth of them; so that, as I have said
above, he is certainly walking to and fro thro' the Earth, _&c._ after
_some manner or other_, and in some Figure or other, visible or
invisible, as he finds Occasion. Now in order to make our History of him
complete, the next Question before us is, how, and in what manner he
acts with Mankind? how his Kingdom is carried on, and by what Methods he
does his Business, for he certainly has a great deal of Business to do;
he is not an idle Spectator, nor is he walking about _incognito_, and
cloth'd in Mist and Darkness, purely in Kindness to us, that we should
not be frighted at him; but 'tis in Policy, that he may act
undiscover'd, that he may see and not be seen, may play his Game in the
dark, and not be detected in his Roguery; that he may prompt Mischief,
raise Tempests, blow up Coals, kindle Strife, embroil Nations, use
Instruments, and not be known to have his Hand in any thing, when at the
same time he really has a Hand in every thing.

Some are of Opinion, _and I among the rest_, that if the _Devil_ was
personally and visibly present among us, and we conversed with him Face
to Face, we should be so familiar with him in a little time, that his
ugly Figure would not affect us at all, that his Terrors would not
fright us, or that we should any more trouble our selves about him,
than we did with the last great Comet in 1678, which appear'd so long
and so constantly without any particular known Event, that at last we
took no more Notice of it than of the other ordinary Stars which had
appear'd before we or our Ancestors were born.

Nor indeed should we have much Reason to be frighted at him, or at least
none of those silly Things could be said of him which we now amuse our
selves about, and by which we set him up like a Scare-Crow to fright
Children and old Women, to fill up old Stories, make Songs and Ballads,
and in a Word, carry on the low priz'd Buffoonery of the common People;
we should either see him in his Angelic Form, as he was from the
Original, or if he has any Deformities entail'd upon him by the supreme
Sentence, and in Justice to the Deformity of his Crime, they would be of
a superior Nature, and fitted more for our Contempt as well as Horror,
than those weak fancied Trifles contrived by our antient Devil-raisers
and Devil-makers, to feed the wayward Fancies of old Witches and
Sorcerers, who cheated the ignorant World with a _Devil_ of their own
making, set forth, _in terrorem_, with Bat's Wings, Horns, cloven Foot,
long Tail, fork'd Tongue, and the like.

In the next Place, be his frightful Figure what it would, and his
Legions as numerous as the Host of Heaven, we should see him still, as
the Prince of _Devils_, tho' monstrous as a Dragon, flaming as a Comet,
tall as a Mountain, yet dragging his Chain after him equal to the utmost
of his supposed Strength; always in Custody of his _Jailors_ the Angels,
his Power over-power'd, his Rage cow'd and abated, or at least aw'd and
under Correction, limited and restrain'd; in a Word, we should see him a
vanquish'd Slave, his Spirit broken, his Malice, tho' not abated, yet
Hand-cuff'd and overpower'd, and he not able to work any Thing against
us by Force; so that he would be to us but like the Lions in the Tower,
encag'd and lock'd up, unable to do the Hurt he wishes to do, and that
we fear, or indeed any hurt at all.

From hence 'tis evident, that 'tis not his Business to be public, or to
walk up and down in the World visibly, and in his own Shape; his Affairs
require a quite different Management, as might be made apparent from the
Nature of Things, and the Manner of our Actings, as Men, either with our
selves or to one another.

Nor could he be serviceable in his Generation, as a public Person as now
he is, or answer the End of his Party who employ him, and who, if he was
to do their Business in public, as he does in private, would not be able
to employ him at all.

As in our modern Meetings for the Propagation of Impudence and other
Virtues, there would be no Entertainment and no Improvement for the Good
of the Age, if the People did not all appear in Masque, and conceal'd
from the common Observation; so neither could _Satan_ (from whose
Management those more happy Assemblies are taken as Copies of a glorious
Original) perform the usual and necessary Business of his Profession, if
he did not appear wholly in Covert and under needful Disguises; how, but
for the Convenience of his Habit, could he call himself into so many
Shapes, act on so many different Scenes, and turn so many Wheels of
State in the World, as he has done? as a meer profess'd _Devil_ he could
do nothing.

Had he been oblig'd always to act the meer Devil in his own Clothes, and
with his own Shape, appearing uppermost in all Cafes and Places, he
could never have preach'd in so many Pulpits, presided in so many
Councils, voted in so many Committees, sat in so many Courts, and
influenc'd so many Parties and Factions in Church and State, as we have
Reason to believe he has done in our Nation, and in our Memories too, as
well as in other Nations and in more antient Times. The Share Satan has
had in all the weighty Confusions of the Times, ever since the first
Ages of Christianity in the World, has been carried on with so much
Secresy, and so much with an Air of Cabal and Intrigue, that nothing can
have been manag'd more subtilly and closely, and in the same Manner has
he acted in our Times, in order to conceal his Interest, and conceal the
Influence he has had in the Councils of the World.

Had it been possible for him to have raised the Flames of Rebellion and
War so often in this Nation, as he certainly has done? Could he have
agitated the Parties on both Sides, and inflam'd the Spirits of three
Nations, if he had appears in his own Dress, a meer naked DEVIL? It is
not the Devil as a _Devil_ that does the Mischief, but the _Devil_ in
Masquerade, _Satan_ in full Disguise, and acting at the Head of civil
Confusion and Distraction.

If History may be credited, the _French_ Court at the Time of our old
Confusions was made the Scene of Satan's Politicks, and prompted both
Parties in _England_ and in _Scotland_ also to quarrel, and how was it
done? Will any Man offer to scandalize the _Devil_ so much as to say, or
so much as to suggest that _Satan_ had no Hand in it all? Did not the
_Devil_, by the Agency of Cardinal _Richlieu_, send 400000 Crowns at one
Time, and 600000 at another, to the _Scots_, to raise an Army and march
boldly into _England?_ and did not the same _Devil_ at the same time, by
other Agents, remit 800000 Crowns to the other Party, in order to raise
an Army to fall upon the _Scots_? nay, did not the _Devil_ with the
same Subtilty send down the Archbishop's Order to impose the
Service-Book upon the People in _Scotland_, and at the same Time raise a
Mob against it, in the great Church (at St. _Giles_'s)? Nay, did not he
actually, in the Person of an old Woman (his favourite Instrument) throw
the three-leg'd Stool at the Service-Book, and animate the zealous
People to take up Arms for Religion, and turn Rebels for God Sake?

All these happy and successful Undertakings, tho' 'tis no more to be
doubted they were done by the Agency of _Satan_, and in a very
surprizing Manner too, yet were all done in secret, by what I call
Possession and Injection, and by the Agency and Contrivance of such
Instruments, or by the _Devil_ in the Disguise of such Servants as he
found out fitted to be employ'd in his Work, and who he took a more
effectual Care in concealing of.

But we shall have Occasion to touch all this Part over again, when we
come to discourse of the particular Habits and Disguises which the
_Devil_ has made use of, all along in the World, the better to cover his
Actions, and to conceal his being concern'd in them.

In the mean Time the Cunning or Artifice the _Devil_ makes use of in all
these Things is in it self very considerable; 'tis an old Practice of
his using, and he has gone on in diverse Measures, for the better
concealing himself in it; which Measures, tho' he varies sometimes, as
his extraordinary Affairs require, yet they are in all Ages much the
same, and have the same Tendency; namely, that he may get all his
Business carried on by the Instrumentality of Fools; that he may make
Mankind Agents in their own Destruction, and that he may have all his
Work done in such a Manner as that he may seem to have no Hand in it;
nay he contrives so well, that the very Name _Devil_ is put upon his
opposite Party, and the Scandal of the black Agent lies all upon them.

In order then to look a little into his Conduct, let us enquire into the
common Mistakes about him, see what Use is made of them to his
Advantage, and how far Mankind is imposed upon in those Particulars, and
to what Purpose.




CHAP. IV.

_Of Satan's Agents or Missionaries, and their Actings upon and in the
     Minds of Men in his Name._


Infinite Advantages attend the _Devil_ in his retired Government, as
they respect the Management of his Interests, and the carrying on his
absolute Monarchy in the World; particularly as it gives him room to act
by the Agency of his inferior Ministers and Messengers, call'd on many
Occasions _his Angels_, of whom he has an innumerable _Multitude_, at
his Command, enough, for ought we know, to spare one to attend every Man
and Woman now alive in the World; and of whom, if we may believe our
second sight Christians, the Air is always as full, as a Beam of the
Evening Sun is of Insects, where they are ever ready for Business, and
to go and come as their great Governor issues out Orders for their
Directions.

These, as they are all of the same spirituous Quality with himself, and
consequently invisible like him, _except as above_, are ready upon all
Occasions to be sent to _and into_ any such Person, and for such
Purposes, _superior Limitations only excepted_, as the grand Director of
_Devils_, (The _Devil_ properly so call'd guides them;) and be the
Subject or the Object what it will, _that is to say_, be the Person they
are sent to, _or into, as above_, who it will, and the Business the
Messenger is to do what it will, they are sufficiently qualified; for
this is a Particular to Satan's Messengers or Agents, that they are not
like us humane _Devils_ here in the World, some bred up one Way, some
another, some of one Trade, some of another, and consequently some fit
for some Business, some for another, some good for something, and some
good for nothing, but his People are every one fit for every Thing, can
find their Way every where, and are a Match for every Body they are sent
to; in a Word, there are no _foolish Devils_, they are all fully
qualified for their Employment, fit for any thing he sets them about,
and very seldom mistake their Errand or fail in the Business they are
sent to do.

Nor is it strange at all, that the _Devil_ should have such a numberless
Train of Deputy _Devils_ to act under him; for it must be acknowledged
he has a great deal of Business upon his Hands, a vast deal of Work to
do, abundance of public Affairs under his Direction, and an infinite
Variety of particular Cases always before him; _for Example_.

How many Governments in the World are wholly in his Administration? how
many Divans and great Councils under his Direction? nay, I believe,
'twould be hard to prove that there is or has been one Council of State
in the World for many hundred Years past, down to the Year 1713, (we
don't pretend to come nearer home) where the _Devil_ by himself, or his
Agents in one Shape or another, has not sat as a Member, if not taken
the Chair.

And tho' some learn'd Authors may dispute this Point with me, by giving
some Examples where the Councils of Princes have been acted by a better
Hand, and where Things have been carried against _Satan_'s Interest, and
even to his great Mortification, it amounts to no more than this;
namely, that in such Cases the _Devil_ has been out-voted; but it does
not argue but he might have been present there, and have push'd his
Interest as far as he could, only that he had not the Success he
expected; for I don't pretend to say that he has never been
disappointed; but those Examples are so rare, and of so small
Signification, that when I come to the Particulars, as I shall do in the
Sequel of this History, you will find them hardly worth naming; and
that, take it one Time with another, the _Devil_ has met with such a
Series of Success in all his Affairs, and has so seldom been baulk'd;
and where he has met with a little Check in his Politicks, has
notwithstanding, so soon and so easily recover'd himself, regain'd his
lost Ground, or replac'd himself in another Country when he has been
supplanted in one, that his Empire is far from being lessen'd in the
World, for the last thousand Years of the Christian Establishment.

Suppose we take an Observation from the Beginning of _Luther_, or from
the Year 1420, and call the Reformation a Blow to the _Devil_'s Kingdom,
which before that was come to such a Height in Christendom, that 'tis a
Question not yet thorowly decided, whether that Medley of Superstition
and horrible Heresies, that Mass of Enthusiam and Idols call'd the
Catholick Hierarchy, was a Church of God or a Church of the _Devil_;
whether it was an Assembly of Saints or a Synagogue of Satan: I say,
take that Time to be the _Epocha_ of Satan's Declension and of
Lucifer's falling from Heaven, that is, from the Top of his terrestrial
Glory, yet whether he did not gain in the Defection of the _Greek_
Church about that Time and since, as much as he lost in the Reformation
of the _Roman_, is what Authors are not yet agreed about, not reckoning
what he has regain'd since of the Ground which he had lost even by the
Reformation, (_viz._) the Countries of the Duke of _Savoy_'s Dominion,
where the Reformation is almost eaten out by Persecution; the whole
_Valtoline_ and some adjacent Countries; the whole Kingdom of _Poland_
and almost all _Hungary_; for since the last War the Reformation, as it
were, lies gasping for Breath, and expiring in that Country, also
several large Provinces in _Germany_, as _Austria_, _Carinthia_, and the
whole Kingdom of _Bohemia_, where the Reformation once powerfully
planted, receiv'd its Death's Wound at the Battle of _Prague_, _Ann._
1627, and languish'd but a very little while, died and was buried, and
good King POPERY reign'd in its stead.

To these Countries thus regain'd to Satan's infernal Empire, let us add
his modern Conquests and the Encroachments he has made upon the
Reformation in the present Age, which are, _however light we make of
them_, very considerable (_viz._) the Electorate of the _Rhine_ and the
_Palatinate_, the one fallen to the House of _Bavaria_, and the other to
that of _Neuburgh_, both Popish; the Dutchy of _Deux Ponts_ fallen just
now to a popish Branch, the whole Electorate of _Saxony_ fallen under
the Power of popish Government by the Apostacy of their Princes, and
more likely to follow the Fate of _Bohemia_, whenever the diligent
_Devil_ can bring his new Project in _Poland_ to bear, as 'tis more than
probable he will do so some time or other, by the growing Zeal as well
as Power of (that House of Bigots) the House of _A----_.

But to sum up the dull Story; we must add in the Roll of the _Devil_'s
Conquests, the whole Kingdom of _France_, where we have in one Year
seen, to the immortal Glory of the _Devil_'s Politicks, that his
Measures have prevailed to the total Extirpation of the Protestant
Churches without a War; and that Interest which for 200 Years had
supported it self in spight of Persecutions, Massacres, five civil Wars
and innumerable Battles and Slaughters, at last receiv'd its mortal
Wound from its own Champion _Henry_ IV. and sunk into utter Oblivion, by
_Satan_'s most exquisite Management under the Agency of his two prime
Ministers Cardinal _Richlieu_ and _Lewis_ the XIV, whom he entirely
possess'd.

Thus far we have a melancholy View of the _Devil_'s new Conquests, and
the Ground he has regain'd upon the Reformation, in which his secret
Management has been so exquisite, and his Politicks so good, that could
he bring but one Thing to pass, which by his own former Mistake, (for
the _Devil_ is not infallible) he has rendred impossible, he would bring
the Protestant Interest so near its Ruin, that Heaven would be, _as it
were_, put to the Necessity of working by Miracle to prevent it; _the
Case is thus_.

Antient Historians tell us, and from good Authority, that the DEVIL
finding it for his Interest to bring his favourite _Mahomet_ upon the
Stage, and spread the victorious Half-Moon upon the Ruin of the Cross,
having with great Success, rais'd first the _Saracen_ Empire, and then
the _Turkish_ to such a Height, as that the Name of Christian seemed to
be extirpated in those two Quarters of the World, which were then not
the greatest only, but by far the most powerful, I mean _Asia_ and
_Africa_; having totally laid wast all those antient and flourishing
Churches of _Africa_, the Labours of St. _Cyprian_, _Tertullian_, St.
_Augustine_, and 670 Christian Bishops and Fathers, who govern'd there
at once, also all the Churches of _Smyrna_, _Philadelphia_, _Ephesus_,
_Sardis_, _Antioch_, _Laodicea_, and innumerable others in _Pontus_,
_Bithynia_, and the Provinces of the lesser _Asia_.

The _Devil_ having, I say, finish'd these Conquests so much to his
Satisfaction, began to turn his Eyes Northward, and tho' he had a
considerable Interest in the _Whore of Babylon_, and had brought his
Power by the Subjection of the _Roman_ Hierarchy to a great Height, yet
finding the Interest of _Mahomet_ most suitable to his _devilish_
Purposes, as most adapted to the Destruction of Mankind, and laying
waste the World, he resolv'd to espouse the growing Power of the _Turk_,
and bring him in upon _Europe_ like a Deluge.

In order to this, and to make Way for an easy Conquest, like a true
_Devil_ he work'd under Ground, and sap'd the Foundation of the
Christian Power, by sowing Discord among the reigning Princes of
_Europe_; that so envying one another they might be content to stand
still and look on while the _Turk_ devoured them one by one, and at last
might swallow them up all.

This _devilish_ Policy took to his Heart's Content; the Christian
Pn their Aspect to qualify them
for their Employment; whence it is become proverbial, when our Looks are
very dismal and frightful, to say, I look like a Witch, or in other
Cases to say, as ugly as a Witch; in another Case to look as envious as
a Witch; now whether there is any Thing particularly requir'd in the
Looks of the DEVIL's modern Agents, which is assisting in the Discharge
of their Offices, and which make their Answers appear more solemn, this
the _Devil_ has not yet reveal'd, at least not to me; and therefore why
it is that he singles out such Creatures as are fit only to fright the
People that come to them with their Enquiries, I do not take upon me to
determine.

Perhaps it is necessary they should be thus extraordinary in their
Aspect, that they might strike an Awe into the Minds of their Votaries,
as if they were Satan's true and real Representatives; and that the said
Votaries may think when they speak to the Witches they are really
talking to the _Devil_; or perhaps 'tis necessary to the Witches
themselves, that they should be so exquisitely ugly, that they might not
be surpriz'd at whatever Figure the Devil makes when he first appears to
them, being certain they can see nothing uglier than themselves.

Some are of the Opinion that the Communication with the _Devil_, or
between the Devil and those Creatures his Agents, has something
assimulating in it, and that if they were tolerable before, they are,
_ipso facto_, turn'd into DEVILS by talking with him; I will not say but
that a Tremor in the Limbs, a Horror in the Aspect, and a surprizing
Stare in the Eyes may seize upon some of them when they really see the
DEVIL, and that the frequent Repetition may make those Distortions,
which we so constantly see in their Faces becomes natural to them; by
which if it does not continue always upon the Countenance, they can at
least, _like the Posture-Masters_, cast themselves into such Figures and
frightful Dislocations of the Lines and Features in their Faces, and so
assume a Devil's Face suitable to the Occasion, or as may serve the turn
for which they take it up, and as often as they have any use for it.

But be it which of these the Enquirer pleases, 'tis all one to the Case
in Hand; this is certain, that such deform'd _Devil-like_ Creatures,
most of those we call _Hags_ and _Witches_, are in their Shapes and
Aspects, and that they give out their Sentences and frightful Messages
with an Air of Revenge for some Injury receiv'd; for Witches are fam'd
chiefly for doing Mischief.

It seems the _Devil_ has always pick'd out the most ugly and frightful
old Women to do his Business; _Mother Shipton_, our famous _English_
Witch or Prophetess, is very much wrong'd in her Picture, if she was not
of the most terrible Aspect imaginable; and if it be true that _Merlin_,
the famous _Welch_ Fortune-Teller, was a frightful Figure, it will seem
the more rational to believe, if we credit another Story, (_viz._) that
he was begotten by the Devil himself, of which I shall speak by it self:
But to go back to the Devil's Instruments being so ugly; it may be
observed, I say, that the Devil has always dealt in such sort of Cattle;
the _Sybils_, of whom so many strange prophetic Things are recorded,
whether true or no is not to the Question, are (if the _Italian_
Painters may have any Credit given them) all represented as very old
Women; and as if Ugliness were a Beauty to old Age, they seem to paint
them out as ugly and frightful as (not they, the Painters) but even as
the Devil himself could make them; not that I believe there are any
original Pictures of them really extant; but it is not unlikely that the
_Italians_ might have some traditional Knowledge of them, or some
remaining Notions of them, or particularly that antient _Sybil_ named
_Anus_, who sold the fatal Book to _Tarquin_; 'tis said of her that
_Tarquin_ supposed she doated with Age.

I had Thoughts indeed here to have entred into a learned Disquisition of
the Excellency of old Women in all diabolical Operations, and
particularly of the Necessity of having recourse to them for _Satan_'s
more exquisite Administration, which also may serve to solve the great
Difficulty in the natural Philosophy of Hell; namely, why it comes to
pass that the Devil is oblig'd for want of old Women, properly so
call'd, to turn so many antient Fathers, grave Counsellors both of Law
and State, and especially Civilians or Doctors of the Law into old
Women, and how the extraordinary Operation is perform'd; but this, as a
Thing of great Consequence in Satan's Management of humane Affairs, and
particularly as it may lead us into the necessary History, as well as
Characters of some of the most eminent of these Sects among us, I have
purposely reserv'd for a Work by it self, to be published, if _Satan
hinders not_, in fifteen Volumes in Folio, wherein I shall in the first
Place define in the most exact Manner possible, what is to be understood
by a _Male old Woman_, of what heterogeneous Kind they are produced,
give you the monstrous Anatomy of the Parts, and especially those of the
Head, which being fill'd with innumerable Globules of a sublime Nature,
and which being of a fine Contexture without, but particularly hollow in
the Cavity, defines most philosophically that antient paradoxical
Saying, (_viz._) _being full of Emptiness_, and makes it very consistent
with Nature and common Sense.

I shall likewise spend some Time, _and it must be Labour too, I assure
you, when 'tis done_, in determining whether this new Species of
Wonderfuls are not deriv'd from that famous _old Woman Merlin_, which I
prove to be very reasonable for us to suppose, because of the many
several judicious Authors, who affirm the said _Merlin_, as I hinted
before, to have been begotten by the _Devil_.

As to the deriving his Gift of Prophesy from the Devil, by that
pretended Generation, I shall omit that Part, because, as I have all
along insisted upon it, that Satan himself has no prophetic or
predicting Powers of his own, it is not very clear to me that he could
convey it to his Posterity, _nil dat quod not habet_.

However, in deriving this so much magnified Prophet in a right Line from
the _Devil_, much may be said in favour of his ugly Face, in which it
was said he was very remarkable, for it is no new Thing for a Child to
be like the Father; but all these weighty Things I adjourn for the
present, and proceed to the Affair in Hand, namely, the several Branches
of the _Devil_'s Management since his quitting his Temples and Oracles.




CHAP. VI.

_Of the extraordinary Appearance of the_ Devil, _and particularly of the
     Cloven-Foot._


Some People would fain have us treat this Tale of the _Devil_'s
appearing with a Cloven-Foot with more Solemnity than I believe the
_Devil_ himself does; for Satan, who knows how much of a Cheat it is,
must certainly ridicule it, in his own Thoughts, to the last Degree; but
as he is glad of any Way to hoodwink the Understandings, and bubble the
weak Part of the World; so if he sees Men willing to take every
Scarecrow for a Devil, it is not his Business to undeceive them; on the
other Hand, he finds it his Interest to foster the Cheat, and serve
himself of the Consequence: Nor could I doubt but the Devil, if any
Mirth be allow'd him, often laughs at the many frightful Shapes and
Figures we dress him up in, and especially to see how willing we are
first to paint him as black, and make him appear as ugly as we can, and
then stare and start at the Spectrum of our own making.

The Truth is, that among all the Horribles that we dress up Satan in, I
cannot but think we shew the least of Invention in this of a Goat, or a
Thing with a Goat's Foot, of all the rest; for tho' a Goat is a Creature
made use of by our Saviour in the Allegory of the Day of Judgment, and
is said there to represent the wicked rejected Party, yet it seems to be
only on Account of their Similitude to the Sheep, and so to represent
the just Fate of Hypocrisy and Hypocrites, and in particular to form the
necessary Antithesis in the Story; for else, _our whimsical Fancies
excepted_, a Sheep or a Lamb has a Cloven-Foot as well as a Goat; nay,
if the Scripture be of any Value in the Case, 'tis to the _Devil_'s
Advantage, for the dividing the Hoof was the distinguishing Character or
Mark of a clean Beast, and how the Devil can be brought into that Number
is pretty hard to say.

One would have thought if we had intended to have given a just Figure of
the _Devil_, it would have been more apposite to have rank'd him among
the Cat-kind, and given him a Foot (if he is to be known by his Foot)
like a Lion, or like a _red Dragon_, being the same Creatures which he
is represented by in the Text, and so his Claws would have had some
Terror in them as well as his Teeth.

But neither is the _Goat_ a true Representative of the Devil at all, for
we do not rank the Goats among the Subtle or cunning Part of the Brutes;
he is counted a fierce Creature indeed of his Kind, tho' nothing like
those other abovemention'd; and he is emblematically used to represent a
lustful Temper, but even that Part does not fully serve to describe the
Devil, whose Operation lies principally another Way.

Besides it is not the _Goat_ himself that is made use of, 'tis the
Cloven-Hoof only, and that so particularly, that the _Cloven Foot_ of a
Ram or a Swine, or any other Creature, may serve as well as that of a
_Goat_, only that History gives us some Cause to call it the _Goat_'s
_Foot_.

In the next Place 'tis understood by us not as a bare Token to know
_Satan_ by, but as if it were a Brand upon him, and that like the Mark
God put upon _Cain_, it was given him for a Punishment, so that he
cannot get leave to appear without it, nay cannot conceal it whatever
other Dress or Disguise he may put on; and as if it was to make him as
ridiculous as possible, they will have it be, that whenever _Satan_ has
Occasion to dress himself in any humane Shape, be it of what Degree
soever, from the King to the Beggar, be it of a fine Lady or of an _old
Woman_, (the Latter it seems he oftenest assumes) yet still he not only
must have this _Cloven-Foot_ about him, but he is oblig'd to shew it
too; nay, they will not allow him any Dress, whether it be a Prince's
Robes, a Lord Cha---r's Gown, or a Lady's Hoop and long Petticoats, but
the Cloven-Foot must be shew'd from under them; they will not so much as
allow him an artificial _Shoe_ or a _Jack-Boot_, as we often see
contriv'd to conceal a _Club-Foot_ or a _Wooden-Leg_; but that the
_Devil_ may be known wherever he goes, he is bound to shew his Foot;
they might as well oblige him to set a Bill upon his Cap, as Folks do
upon a House to be let, and have it written in capital Letters, _I am
the_ DEVIL.

It must be confess'd this is very particular, and would be very hard
upon the _Devil_, if it had not another Article in it, which is some
Advantage to him, and that is, that _the Fact is not true_; but the
Belief of this is so universal, that all the World runs away with it; by
which Mistake the good People miss the _Devil_ many times where they
look for him, and meet him as often where they did not expect him, and
when for want of this Cloven-Foot they do not know him.

Upon this very Account I have sometimes thought, not that this has been
put upon him by meer Fancy, and the Cheat of a heavy Imagination,
propagated by Fable and Chymny-Corner Divinity, but that it has been a
Contrivance of his own; and that, in short, the Devil rais'd this
Scandal upon himself, that he might keep his Disguise the better, and
might go a Visiting among his Friends without being known; for were it
really so, that he could go no where without this particular Brand of
Infamy, he could not come into Company, could not dine with my Lord
Mayor, nor drink Tea with the Ladies, could not go to the Drawing-R----
at ------, could not have gone to _Fountainbleau_ to the King of
_France_'s Wedding, or to the Diet of _Poland_, to prevent the Grandees
there coming to an Agreement; nay, _which would be still worse than
all_, he could not go to the Masquerade, nor to any of our Balls; the
Reason is plain, he would be always discover'd, expos'd and forc'd to
leave the good Company, or which would be as bad, the Company would all
cry out the _Devil_ and run out of the Room as if they were frighted;
nor could all the Help of Invention do him any Service, no Dress he
could put on would cover him; not all our Friends at _Tavistock Corner_
could furnish him with a Habit that would disguise or conceal him, this
unhappy Foot would spoil it all: Now this would be a great a Loss to
him, that I question whether he could carry on any of his most important
Affairs in the World without it; for tho' he has access to Mankind in
his compleat Disguise, I mean that of his Invisibility, yet the Learned
very much agree in this, that his corporal Presence in the World is
absolutely necessary upon many Occasions, to support his Interest and
keep up his Correspondences, and particularly to encourage his Friends
when Numbers are requisite to carry on his Affairs; but this Part I
shall have Occasion to speak of again, when I come to consider him as a
Gentleman of Business in his Locality, and under the Head of visible
Apparition; but I return to the _Foot_.

As I have thus suggested that the Devil himself has politically spread
about this Notion concerning his appearing with _a Cloven-Foot_, so I
doubt not that he has thought it for his Purpose to paint this
_Cloven-Foot_ so lively in the Imaginations of many of our People, and
especially of those clear sighted Folks who see the _Devil_ when he is
not to be seen, that they would make no Scruple to say, nay and to make
Affidavit too, even before _Satan_ himself, whenever he sat upon the
Bench, that they had seen his Worship's Foot at such and such a Time;
this I advance the rather because 'tis very much for his Interest to do
this, for if we had not many Witnesses, _viva voce_, to testify it, we
should have had some obstinate Fellows always among us, who would have
denied the Fact, or at least have spoken doubtfully of it, and so have
rais'd Disputes and Objections against it, as impossible, or at least as
improbable; buzzing one ridiculous Notion or other into our Ears, as if
the Devil was not so black as he was painted, that he had no more a
_Cloven-Foot_ than a Pope, whose Apostolical Toes have so often been
reverentially kiss'd by Kings and Emperors: but now alas this Part is
out of the Question, not the Man in the Moon, not the Groaning-Board,
not the speaking of Fryar _Bacon_'s Brazen-Head, not the Inspiration of
_Mother Shipton_, or the Miracles of Dr. _Faustus_, Things as certain as
Death and Taxes, can be more firmly believ'd: The Devil not have a
Cloven-Foot! I doubt not but I could, in a short Time, bring you a
thousand old Women together, that would as soon believe there was no
Devil at all; nay, they will tell you, he could not be a Devil without
it, any more than he could come into the Room, and the Candles not burn
blue, or go out and not leave a smell of Brimstone behind him.

Since then the Certainty of the Thing is so well establish'd, and there
are so many good and substantial Witnesses ready to testify that he has
a Cloven-Foot, and that they have seen it too; nay, and that we have
Antiquity on our Side, for we have this Truth confirm'd by the Testimony
of many Ages; why should we doubt it any longer? we can prove that many
of our Ancestors have been of this Opinion, and divers learn'd Authors
have left it upon Record, as particularly that learned Familiarist
Mother _Hazel_, whose Writings are to be found in MS. in the famous
Library at _Pye-Corner_; also the admir'd _Joan_ of _Amesbury_, the
History of the _Lancashire_ Witches, and the Reverend Exorcist of the
_Devil_'s of _London_, whose History is extant among us to this Day; all
these and many more may be quoted, and their Writings referr'd to for
the Confirmation of the Antiquity of this Truth; but there seems to be
no Occasion for farther Evidence, 'tis enough, _Satan_ himself, if he
did not raise the Report, yet tacitly owns the Fact, at least he appears
willing to have it believ'd, and be receiv'd as a general Truth for the
Reasons above.

But besides all this, and as much a Jest as some unbelieving People
would have this Story pass for, who knows but that if _Satan_ is
empower'd to assume any Shape or Body, and to appear to us visibly, as
if really so shap'd; I say, who knows but he may, by the same Authority,
be allow'd to assume the Addition of the Cloven-Foot, or two or four
Cloven-Feet, if he pleased? and why not a _Cloven-Foot_ as well as any
other Foot, if he thinks fit? For if the _Devil_ can assume a Shape, and
can appear to Mankind in a visible Form, it may, I doubt not, with as
good Authority be advanc'd that he is left at Liberty to assume what
Shape he pleases, and to choose _what Case of Flesh and Blood he'll
please to wear_, whether real or imaginary; and if this Liberty be
allow'd him, it is an admirable Disguise for him to come generally with
his _Cloven-Foot_, that when he finds it for his Purpose, on special
Occasions to come without it, as I said above, he may not be suspected;
_but take this with you as you go_, that all this is upon a Supposition
that the _Devil_ can assume a visible Shape, and make a real Appearance,
which however I do not yet think fit to grant or deny.

Certain it is, the first People who bestow'd a _Cloven-Foot_ upon the
Devil, were not so despicable as you may imagine, but were real
Favourites of Heaven; for did not _Aaron_ set up the _Devil_ of a Calf
in the Congregation, and set the People a dancing about it for a God?
Upon which Occasion, Expositors tell us, that particular Command was
given, _Levit._ xvii. 7. _They shall no more offer their Sacrifices
unto_ Devils, _after whom they have gone a Whoring_; likewise King
_Jeroboam_ set up the two Calves, one at _Dan_ and the other at
_Bethel_, and we find them charg'd afterwards with setting up the
Worship of _Devils_ instead of the Worship of _God_.

After this we find some Nations actually sacrificed to the _Devil_ in
the Form of a Ram, and others of a Goat; from which, and that above of
the Calves at _Horeb_, I doubt not the Story of the _Cloven-Foot_ first
derived; and it is plain that the Worship of that Calf at _Horeb_ is
meant in the Scripture quoted above, _Levit._ xvii. 7. _Thou shalt no
more offer Sacrifices unto Devils_: The Original is _Seghnirim_; that
is, rough and hairy _Goats_ or _Calves_; and some think also in this
Shape the _Devil_ most ordinarily appeared to the _Egyptians_ and
_Arabians_, from whence it was derived.

Also in the old Writings of the _Egyptians_, I mean their hieroglyphick
Writing, before the Use of Letters was known, we are told this was the
Mark that he was known by; and the Figure of a _Goat_ was the
_Hieroglyphick_ of the _Devil_; some will affirm that the _Devil_ was
particularly pleased to be so represented; how they came by their
Information, and whether they had it from his own Mouth or not, Authors
have not yet determined.

But be this as it will, I do not see that _Satan_ could have been at a
Loss for some extraordinary Figure to have banter'd Mankind with, tho'
this had not been thought of; but thinking of the _Cloven-Foot_ first,
and the Matter being indifferent, this took place, and easily rooted it
self in the bewildred Fancy of the People, and now 'tis riveted too fast
for the _Devil_ himself to remove it if he was disposed to try; but as I
said above, 'tis none of his Business to solve Doubts or remove
Difficulties out of our Heads, but to perplex us with more, as much as
he can.

Some People carry this Matter a great deal higher still, and will have
the _Cloven-Foot_ be like the great Stone which the _Brasilian
Conjurers_ used to solve all difficult Questions upon, after having used
a great many monstrous and barbarous Gestures and Distortions of their
Bodies, and cut certain Marks or magical Figures upon the Stone; so, _I
say_, they will have this Cloven-Foot be a kind of a Conjuring-Stone,
and tell us, that in former Times, when _Satan_ drove a greater Trade
with Mankind in publick, than he has done of late, he gave this
_Cloven-Foot_ as a Token to his particular Favourites to work Wonders
with, and to conjure by, and that Witches, Fairies, Hobgoblins, and such
Things, of which the Antients had several Kinds, at least in their
Imagination, had all a _Goat's Leg_ with a _Cloven-Foot_ to put on upon
extraordinary Occasions; it seems this Method is of late grown out of
Practice, and so like the melting of Marble and the painting of Glass,
'tis laid aside among the various useful Arts which History tells us are
lost to the World; what may be practised in the Fairy World, if such a
Place there be, we can give no particular Account at present.

But neither is this all, for other wou'd-be-wise People take upon them
to make farther and more considerable Improvements upon this Doctrine of
the _Cloven-Foot_, and treat it as a most significant Instrument of
Satan's private Operation, and that as _Joseph_ is said to _Divine_,
that is to say, to _conjure_ by his Golden Cup which was put into
_Benjamin_'s Sack, so the _Devil_ has managed several of his secret
Operations, and Possessions, and other hellish Mechanisms upon the
Spirits as well as Bodies of Men, by the Medium or Instrumentality of
the _Cloven-Foot_; accordingly it had a Kind of an hellish Inspiration
in it, and a separate and magical Power by which he wrought his infernal
Miracles; that the Cloven-Foot had a superior Signification, and was not
only emblematic and significative of the Conduct of Men, but really
guided their Conduct in the most important Affairs of Life; and that the
Agents the Devil employ'd to influence Mankind, and to delude them and
draw them into all the Snares and Traps that he lays continually for
their Destruction, were equipp'd with this Foot in Aid of their other
Powers for Mischief.

Here they read us learn'd Lectures upon the sovereign Operations which
the Devil is at present Master of, in the Government of human Affairs;
and how the Cloven-Foot is an Emblem of the true _double Entendre_ or
divided Aspect, which the great Men of the World generally act with, and
by which all their Affairs are directed; from whence it comes to pass
that there is no such Thing as a single hearted Integrity, or an
upright Meaning to be found in the World; that Mankind, worse than the
ravenous Brutes, preys upon his own Kind, and devours them by all the
laudable Methods of Flattery, Whyne, Cheat and Treachery; _Crocodile
like_, weeping over those it will devour, destroying those it smiles
upon, and, in a Word, devours its own Kind, which the very Beasts
refuse, and that by all the Ways of Fraud and Allurement that _Hell_ can
invent; holding out a cloven divided Hoof, or Hand, pretending to save,
when the very Pretence is made use of to ensnare and destroy.

Thus the divided Hoof is the Representative of a divided double Tongue,
and Heart, an Emblem of the most exquisite Hypocrisy, the most fawning
and fatally deceiving Flattery; and here they give us very diverting
Histories, tho' tragical in themselves, of the manner which some of the
_Devil_'s inspired Agents have manag'd themselves under the especial
Influence of the _Cloven-Foot_; how they have made War under the
Pretence of Peace, murther'd Garrisons under the most sacred
Capitulations, massacred innocent Multitudes after Surrenders to Mercy.

Again, they tell us the _Cloven-Foot_ has been made use of in all
Treasons, Plots, Assassinations, and secret as well as open Murthers and
Rebellions. Thus _Joab_ under the Treason of an Embrace, shew'd how
dexterously he could manage the _Cloven-Foot_, and struck _Abner_ under
the fifth Rib: Thus _David_ play'd the Cloven-Foot upon poor _Uriah_,
when he had a Mind to lie with his Wife: Thus _Brutus_ play'd it upon
_Cæsar_; and to come nearer home, we have had a great many retrograde
Motions in this Country by this magical Implement the _Foot_; Such as
that of the Earl of _Essex_'s Fate, beheading the Queen of _Scots_, and
diverse others in Queen _Elizabeth_'s Time: That of the Earl of
_Shrewsbury_ and Sir _Thomas Overbury_, _Gondamor_ and Sir _Walter
Raleigh_, and many others in King _James_ the I.'s Time; in all which,
if the Cloven-Foot had not been dexterously manag'd, those Murthers had
not been so dexterously manag'd, or the Murtherers have so well been
skreen'd from Justice; for which and the imprecated Justice of Heaven
unappeased, some have thought the innocent Branches of the Royal House
of _Stuart_ did not fare the better in the Ages which follow'd.

It must be confess'd, the Cloven-Foot was in its full Exercise in the
next Reign, and the Generation that rose up immediately after them,
arrived to the most exquisite Skill for Management of it; here they
fasted and pray'd, there they plunder'd and murther'd; here they rais'd
War for the King, and there they fought against him, cutting Throats for
_God's Sake_, and deposing both King and kingly Government according to
Law.

Nor was the _Cloven-Foot_ unemployed on all Sides, for 'tis the main
Excellency of this Instrument of Hell, that it acts on every Side, it is
its denominating Quality, and is for that Reason call'd a cloven or
divided Hoof.

This mutilated Apparition has been so publick in other Countries too,
that it seems to convince us the Devil is not confin'd to _England_
only, but that as his Empire extended to all the sublunary World, so he
gives them all Room to see he is qualified to manage them his own Way.

What abundant Use did that Prince of Dissemblers, _Charles_ V. make of
this Foot? 'twas by the Help of this Apparition of the Foot that he
baited his Hook with the City of _Milan_, and tickled _Francis_ I. of
_France_ so well with it, that when he pass'd thro' _France_, and was in
that King's Power, he let him go, and never get the Bait off of the Hook
neither; it Seems the _Foot_ was not on King _Francis_'s Side at that
Time.

How cruelly did _Philip_ II. of _Spain_ manage this Foot in the Murther
of the Nobility of the _Spanish Netherlands_, the Assassination of the
Prince of _Orange_, and at last: in that of his own Son _Don Carlos_
Infant of _Spain_? and yet such was the _Devil_'s Craft, and so nicely
did he bestir his _Cloven-Hoof_, that this Monarch died consolated (tho'
impenitent) in the Arms of the Church, and with the Benediction of the
Clergy too, _those second best Managers of the said Hoof in the World_.

I must acknowledge, I agree with this Opinion thus far; namely, that the
Devil acting by this Cloven-Foot, as a Machine, has done great Things in
the World for the propagating his dark Empire among us; and History is
full of Examples, besides the little low priz'd Things done among us;
for we are come to such a Kind of Degeneracy in Folly, that we have even
dishonour'd the _Devil_, and put this glorious Engine the Cloven-Foot to
such mean Uses, that the _Devil_ himself seems to be asham'd of us.

But to return a little to foreign History, besides what has been
mention'd above, we find flaming Examples of most glorious Mischief done
by this Weapon, when put into the Hands of Kings and Men of Fame in the
World: How many Games have the Kings of _France_ play'd with this
_Cloven-Foot_, and that within a few Years of one another? First,
_Charles_ IX. play'd the _Cloven-Foot_ upon _Gaspar Coligni_ Admiral of
_France_, when he caress'd him, complimented him, invited him to
_Paris_, to the Wedding of the King of _Navarre_, call'd him Father,
kiss'd him, and when he was wounded sent his own Surgeons to take Care
of him, and yet three Days after order'd him to be assassinated and
murther'd, used with a thousand Indignities, and at last thrown out of
the Window into the Street to be insulted by the Rabble?

Did not _Henry_ III. in the same Country, play the Cloven-Foot upon the
Duke of _Guise_, when he call'd him to his Council, and caus'd him to be
murther'd as he went in at the Door? The _Guises_ again plaid the same
Game back upon the King, when they sent out a _Jacobin_ Friar to
assassinate him in his Tent as he lay at the Siege of _Paris_.

In a Word, this Opera of the _Cloven-Foot_ has been acted all over the
Christian World, ever since _Judas_ betray'd the Son of God with a Kiss;
nay, our Saviour says expresly of him, _One of you is a Devil_; and the
sacred Text says in another Place, _The Devil enter'd into Judas_.

It would take up a great deal of Time and Paper too, to give you a full
Account of the Travels of this _Cloven-Foot_; its Progress into all the
Courts of _Europe_, and with what most accurate Hypocrisy _Satan_ has
made use of it upon many Occasions, and with what Success; but as in the
elaborate Work of which I just now gave you a Specimen I design one
whole Volume upon this Subject, and which I shall call, _The compleat
History_ of the _Cloven-Foot_; I say, for that Reason, and diverse
others, I shall say but very little more to it in this Place.

It remains to tell you, that this merry Story of the _Cloven-Foot_ is
very essential to the History which I am now writing, as it has been all
along the great Emblem of the _Devil_'s Government in the World, and by
which all his most considerable Engagements have been answer'd and
executed; for as he is said not to be able to conceal this Foot, but
that he carries it always with him, it imports most plainly, that the
_Devil_ would be no _Devil_ if he was not a Dissembler, a Deceiver, and
carried a _double Entendre_ in all he does or says; that he cannot but
say one Thing and mean another, promise one Thing and do another, engage
and not perform, declare and not intend, and act like a true _Devil_ as
he is, with a Countenance that is no Index of his Heart.

I might indeed go back to Originals, and derive this _Cloven-Foot_ from
Satan's primitive State as a Cherubim or a celestial Being, which
Cherubims, as _Moses_ is said to have seen them about the Throne of God
in Mount _Sinai_, and as the same _Moses_, from the Original represented
them afterwards covering the Ark, had the Head and Face of a Man, Wings
of an Eagle, Body of a Lion, and Legs and Feet of a Calf; but this is
not so much to our present Purpose, for as we are to allow that whatever
_Satan_ had of heavenly Beauty before the Fall, he lost it all when he
commenc'd _Devil_, so to fetch his Original so far up would be only to
say, that he retain'd nothing but the _Cloven-Foot_, and that all the
rest of him was alter'd and deform'd, become frightful and horrible as
the DEVIL; but his Cloven-Foot, as we now understand it, is rather
mystical and emblematick, and describes him only as the Fountain of
Mischief and Treason, and the Prince of Hypocrites, and as such we are
now to speak of him.

'Tis from this Original all the hypocritic World copy, he wears the Foot
on their Account, and from this Model they act: This made our blessed
Lord tell them, _the Works of your Father ye will do_, meaning the
_Devil_, as he had express'd it just before.

Nor does he deny the Use of the _Foot_ to the meaner Class of his
Disciples in the World, but decently equips them all upon every
Occasion with a needful Proportion of Hypocrisy and Deceit; that they
may hand on the Power of promiscuous Fraud thro' all his temporal
Dominions, and wear _the Foot_ always about them as a Badge of their
profess'd Share in whatever is done by that Means.

Thus every Dissembler, every false Friend, every secret Cheat, every
Bearskin-Jobber has a _Cloven-Foot_, and so far hands on the Devil's
Interest by the same powerful Agency of Art, as the _Devil_ himself uses
to act when he appears in Person, or would act if he was just now upon
the Spot; for this _Foot_ is a Machine which is to be wound up and wound
down, as the Cause it appears for requires; and there are Agents and
Engineers to act in it by Directions of _Satan_ (the grand Engineer) who
lies still in his Retirement, only issuing out his Orders as he sees
convenient.

Again, every Class, every Trade, every Shopkeeper, every Pedlar, nay,
that meanest of Tradesmen, that Church Pedlar the Pope, has a
Cloven-Foot, with which he _Paw wa's_ upon the World, wishes them all
well, and at the same time cheats them; wishes them all fed, and at the
same time starves them; wishes them all in Heaven, and at the same time
marches before them directly to the Devil, _alamode de Cloven-Foot_.

Nay, the very Bench, the everliving Foundation of Justice in the World;
how often has it been made the Tool of Violence, the Refuge of
Oppression, the Seat of Bribery and Corruption, by this Monster in
Masquerade, and that every where (our own Country always excepted)? They
had much better wipe out the Picture of justice blinded, and having the
Sword and Scales in her Hand, which in foreign Countries is generally
painted over the Seat of those who sit to do Justice, and place instead
thereof a naked unarm'd Cloven-Hoof, a proper Emblem of that Spirit that
Influences the World, and of the Justice we often see administred among
them; human Imagination cannot form an Idea more suitable, nor the
_Devil_ propose an Engine more or better qualified for an Operation of
Justice, by the Influence of Bribery and Corruption; it is this
magnipotent Instrument in the Hands of the Devil, which under the
closest Disguise agitates every Passion, bribes every Affection,
blackens every Virtue, gives a double Face to Words and Actions, and to
all Persons who have any Concern in them, and in a Word, makes us all
Devils to one another.

Indeed the Devil has taken but a dark Emblem to be distinguish'd by, for
this of a Goat was said to be a Creature hated by Mankind from the
beginning, and that there is a natural Antipathy in Mankind against
them: Hence the Scape Goat was to bear the Sins of the People, and to go
into the Wilderness with all that Burthen upon him.

But we have a Saying among us, in Defence of which we must enquire into
the proper Sphere of Action which may be assigned to this Cloven-Foot,
as hitherto described: The Proverb is this; _Every_ Devil _has not a
Cloven-Foot_. This Proverb, instead of giving us some more favourable
Thoughts of the _Devil_, confirms what I have said already, that the
_Devil_ rais'd this Scandal upon himself; I mean, the Report that he
cannot conceal or disguise his Devil's Foot, or Hoof, but that it must
appear, under whatever Habit he shews himself; and the Reason I gave
holds good still, _namely_, that he may be more effectually conceal'd
when he goes abroad without it: For if the People were fully persuaded
that the _Devil_ could not appear without this Badge of his Honour, or
Mark of his Infamy, _take it as you will_; and that he was bound also to
shew it upon all Occasions, it would be natural to conclude, that
whatever frightful Appearances might be seen in the World, if the
Cloven-Foot did not also appear, we had no Occasion to look for the
_Devil_, or so much as to think of him, much less to apprehend he was
near us; and as this might be a Mistake, and that the _Devil_ might be
there while we thought our selves so secure, it might on many Occasions
be a Mistake of very ill Consequence, and in particular, as it would
give the _Devil_ room to act in the Dark, and not be discover'd, where
it might be most needful to know him.

From this short Hint, thus repeated, I draw a new Thesis, namely, That
_Devil_ is most dangerous that has no Cloven-Foot; or, if you will have
it in Words more to the common Understanding, the _Devil_ seems to be
most dangerous when he goes without his Cloven-Foot.

And here a learned Speculation offers it self to our Debate, and which
indeed I ought to call a Council of Casuists, and Men learned in the
_Devil_'s Politicks, to determine:

Whether is most hurtful to the World, the _Devil_ walking about without
his Cloven-Foot, or the Cloven-Foot walking about without the _Devil_?

It is indeed a nice and difficult Question, and merits to be well
enquir'd into; for which Reason, and diverse others, I have referr'd it
to be treated with some Decency, and as a Dispute of Dignity sufficient
to take up a Chapter by itself.




CHAP. VII.

_Whether is most hurtful to the World, the_ Devil _walking about without
     his Cloven-Foot, or the Cloven-Foot walking about without the_ Devil?


In discussing this most critical Distinction of Satan's private Motions,
I must, as the Pulpit Gentlemen direct us, explain the Text, and let you
know what I mean by several dark Expressions in it, that I may not be
understood to talk (as the _Devil_ walks) in the dark.

     1. As to the Devil's walking about.

     2. His walking without his Cloven-Foot.

     3. The Cloven-Foot walking about without the _Devil_.


Now as I study Brevity, and yet would be understood too, you may please
to understand me as I understand my self, thus.

     1. That I must be allow'd to suppose the _Devil_ really has a full
     Intercourse in, and through, and about this Globe, with Egress and
     Regress, for the carrying on his special Affairs, when, how, and
     where, to his Majesty, in his great Wisdom, it shall seem meet;
     that sometimes he appears and becomes visible, and that, like a
     Mastiff without his Clog, he does not always carry his Cloven-Foot
     with him. This will necessarily bring me to some Debate upon the
     most important Question of Apparitions, Hauntings, Walkings, _&c._
     whether of _Satan_ in human Shape, or of human Creatures in the
     _Devil_'s Shape, or in any other manner whatsoever.

     2. I must also be allow'd to tell you that Satan has a great deal
     of Wrong done him by the general embracing vulgar Errors, and that
     there is a Cloven-Foot oftentimes without a _Devil_; or, in short,
     that Satan is not guilty of all the simple Things, no, or of all
     the wicked Things we charge him with.


These two Heads well settled will fully explain the Title of this
Chapter, answer the Query mentioned in it, and at the same time
correspond very well with, and give us a farther Prospect into the main
and original Design of this Work, _namely, The History of the Devil_. We
are so fond of, and pleased with the general Notion of seeing the
_Devil_, that I am loth to disoblige my Readers so much as calling in
question his Visibility would do. Nor is it my Business, any more than
it is his, to undeceive them, where the Belief is so agreeable to them;
especially since upon the whole 'tis not one Farthing matter, either on
one Side or on the other, whether it be so or no, or whether the Truth
of Fact be ever discovered or not.

Certain it is, whether we see him or no, here he is, and I make no doubt
but he is looking on while I am writing this Part of his Story, whether
behind me, or at my Elbow, or over my Shoulder, is not material to me,
nor have I once turned my Head about to see whether he is there or no;
for if he be not in the Inside, I have so mean an Opinion of all his
extravasated Powers, that it seems of very little Consequence to me what
Shape he takes up, or in what Posture he appears; nor indeed can I find
in all my Enquiry that ever the _Devil_ appear'd (_Qua Devil_) in any
of the most dangerous or important of his Designs in the World; the most
of his Projects, especially of the significant Part of them, having been
carried on another way.

However, as I am satisfied no Body will be pleas'd if I should dispute
the Reality of his Appearance, and the World runs away with it as a
receiv'd Point, and that admits no Dispute, I shall most readily grant
the General, and give you some Account of the Particulars.

History is fruitful of Particulars, whether Invention has supply'd them
or not, I will not say, where the _Devil_ is brought upon the Stage in
plain and undeniable Apparition: The Story of _Samuel_ being rais'd by
the Witch of _Endor_, I shall leave quite out of my List, because there
are so many Scruples and Objections against that Story; and as I shall
not dispute with the Scripture, so on the other hand, I have so much
Deference for the Dignity of the _Devil_, as not to determine rashly how
far it may be in the Power of every old (_Witch_) Woman, to call him up
whenever she pleases, and that he must come, whatever the Pretence is,
or whatever Business of Consequence he may be engaged in, as often as
'tis needful for her to _Pa wa_ for half a Crown, or perhaps less than
half the Money.

Nor will I undertake to tell you, till I have talk'd farther with him
about it, how far the _Devil_ is concern'd to discover Frauds, detect
Murthers, reveal Secrets, and especially to tell where any Money is hid,
and shew Folks where to find it; 'tis an odd thing that Satan should
think it of Consequence to come and tell us where such a Miser hid a
Strong Box, or where such an old Woman buried her _Chamber Pot_ full of
Money, the Value of all which is perhaps but a Trifle, when at the same
time he lets so many Veins of Gold, so many unexhausted Mines, nay,
Mountains of Silver, as, we may depend upon it, are hid in the Bowels of
the Earth, and which it would be so much to the Good of whole Nations to
discover, lie still there, and never say one Word of them to any Body.
Besides, how does the _Devil_'s doing Things so foreign to himself, and
so out of his way, agree with the rest of his Character; namely, shewing
a kind of a friendly Disposition to Mankind, or doing beneficent Things?
This is so beneath _Satan_'s Quality, and looks so little, that I scarce
know what to say to it; but that which is still more pungent in the Case
is, these Things are so out of his Road, and so foreign to his Calling,
that it shocks our Faith in them, and seems to clash with all the just
Notions we have of him, and of his Business in the World. The like is to
be said of those little merry Turns we bring him in acting with us, and
upon us, upon trifling and simple Occasions, such as tumbling Chairs and
Stools about House, setting Pots and Vessels Bottom upward, tossing the
Glass and Crokery Ware about without breaking; and such like mean
foolish Things, beneath the Dignity of the _Devil_, who, in my Opinion,
is rather employ'd in setting the World with the Bottom upward, tumbling
Kings and Crowns about, and dashing the Nations one against another;
raising Tempests and Storms, whether at Sea, or on Shore; and, in a
word, doing capital Mischiefs suitable to his Nature, and agreeable to
his Name, _Devil_; and suited to that Circumstance of his Condition,
which I have fully represented in the primitive Part of his exil'd
State.

But to bring in the _Devil_ playing at Push-pin with the World, or like
_Domitian_ catching Flies, that is to say, doing nothing to the
purpose; this is not only deluding our selves, but putting a Slur upon
the _Devil_ himself; and, I say, I shall not dishonour Satan so much as
to suppose any thing in it: However, as I must have a care too how I
take away the proper Materials of Winter Evening Frippery, and leave the
good Wives nothing of the Devil to fright the Children with, I shall
carry the weighty Point no farther. No doubt the _Devil_ and Dr.
_Faustus_ were very intimate; I should rob you of a very significant [6]
Proverb, if I should so much as doubt it; no doubt the _Devil_ shew'd
himself in the Glass to that fair Lady who look'd in it to see where to
place her Patches; but then it should follow too that the _Devil_ is an
Enemy to the Ladies wearing Patches, and that has some Difficulties in
it which we cannot so easily reconcile; but we must tell the Story, and
leave out the Consequences.

But to come to more remarkable Things, and in which the _Devil_ has
thought fit to act in a Figure more suitable to his Dignity, and on
Occasions consistent with himself; take the Story of the Appearance of
_Julius Cæsar_, or the _Devil_ assuming that murthered _Emperor_, to the
great _Marcus Brutus_, who notwithstanding all the good Things said to
justify it, was no less than a King-killer and an Assassinator, which we
in our Language call by a very good Name, and peculiar to the _English_
Tongue, a _Ruffian_.

The Spectre had certainly the Appearance of _Cæsar_, with his Wounds
bleeding fresh, as if he had just receiv'd the fatal Blow; he had
reproach'd him with his Ingratitude, with a _Tu Brute! tu quoque, mi
fili_: "What Thou _Brutus_! Thou, my adopted Son!" Now History seems
to agree universally, not only in the Story itself, but in the
Circumstances of it; we have only to observe that the _Devil_ had
certainly Power to assume, not a human Shape only, but the Shape of
_Julius Cæsar_ in particular.

Had _Brutus_ been a timorous _Conscience-harry'd_, weak-headed Wretch,
had he been under the Horror of the Guilt, and terrify'd with the
Dangers that were before him at that time, we might suggest that he was
over-run with the Vapours, that the Terrors which were upon his Mind
disorder'd him, that his Head was delirious and prepossess'd, and that
his Fancy only plac'd _Cæsar_ so continually in his Eye, that it
realiz'd him to his Imagination, and he believ'd he saw him; with many
other suggested Difficulties to invalidate the Story, and render the
Reality of it doubtful.

But the contrary, to an Extreme, was the Case of _Brutus_; his known
Character plac'd him above the Power of all Hypocondriacks, or fanciful
Delusions; _Brutus_ was of a true _Roman_ Spirit, a bold Hero, of an
intrepid Courage; one that scorn'd to fear even the _Devil_, as the
Story allows: Besides, he glory'd in the Action; there cou'd be no
Terror of Mind upon him; he valued himself upon it, as done in the
Service of Liberty, and the Cause of his Country; and was so far from
being frighted at the _Devil_ in the worst Shape, that he spoke first to
him, and ask'd him, _What art thou?_ and when he was cited to see him
again at _Philippi_, answer'd, with a Gallantry that knew no Fear, _well
I will see thee there_. Whatever the _Devil_'s Business was with
_Brutus_, this is certain, according to all the Historians who give us
the Account of it, that _Brutus_ discover'd no Fear; he did not, _like
Saul at Endor_, fall to the Ground in a Swoon, 1 _Sam._ xxviii. 20.
_Then Saul fell all along upon the Earth, and there was no Strength in
him, and was sore afraid._ In a word, I see no room to charge _Brutus_
with being over-run with the _Hyppo_, or with Vapours, or with Fright
and Terror of Mind; but he saw the _Devil_, that's certain, and with
Eyes open, his Courage not at all daunted, his Mind resolute, and with
the utmost Composure spoke to him, reply'd to his Answer, and defy'd his
Summons to Death, which indeed he fear'd not, as appear'd afterward.

I come next to an Instance as eminent in History as the other; this was
in _Char._ VI. of _France_, sirnamed, _The Beloved_; who riding over the
Forest near _Mans_, a ghastly frightful Fellow (that is to say, the
_Devil_ so clothed in human Vizor) came up to his Horse, and taking hold
of his Bridle, stop'd him, with the Addition of these Words, _Stop King,
whither go you? You are betray'd!_ and immediately disappear'd. It is
true, the King had been distemper'd in his Head before, and so he might
have been deceived, and we might have charg'd it to the Account of a
whimsical Brain, or the Power of his Imagination; but this was in the
Face of his Attendants, several of his great Officers, Courtiers, and
Princes of the Blood being with him, who all saw the Man, heard the
Words, and immediately, to their Astonishment, lost Sight of the
Spectre, who vanish'd from them all.

Two Witnesses will convict a Murtherer, why not a Traitor? This must be
the _Old Gentleman_, emblematically so called, or who must it be? nay,
who else could it be? His Ugliness is not the Case, tho' _ugly as the
Devil_, is a Proverb in his Favour; but vanishing out of sight is an
Essential to a Spirit, and to an evil Spirit in our Times especially.

These are some of the _Devil_'s Extraordinaries, and it must be
confess'd they are not the most agreeable to Mankind, for sometimes he
takes upon him to disorder his Friends very much on these Occasions, as
in the above Case of _Cha._ VI. of _France_; the King, they say, was
really demented ever after; that is, as we vulgarly, but not always
improperly, express it, he was really _frighted out of his Wits_.
Whether the malicious _Devil_ intended it so, or not, is not certain,
tho' it was not so foreign to his particular Disposition if he did.

But where he is more intimate, we are told he appears in a manner less
disagreeable, and there he is more properly _a familiar Spirit_; that
is, in short, a _Devil_ of their Acquaintance: It is true, the Antients
understand the Word, _a familiar Spirit_, to be one of the kinds of
Possession; but if it serves our turn as well under the Denomination of
an intimate _Devil_, or a _Devil_ visitant, it must be acknowledg'd to
be as near in the literal Sense and Acceptation of the Word, as the
other; nay, it must be allow'd 'tis a very great Piece of Familiarity in
the _Devil_ to make Visits, and shew none of his Disagreeables, not
appear formidable, or in the Shape of what he is, respectfully
withholding his dismal Part, in Compassion to the Infirmities of his
Friends.

It is true, _Satan_ may be oblig'd to make different Appearances, as the
several Circumstances of Things call for it; in some Cases he makes his
publick Entry, and then he must shew himself in his Habit of Ceremony;
in other Cases he comes upon private Business, and then he appears in
Disguise; in some publick Cases he may thing fit to be _incog._ and then
he appears dress'd _a la Masque_; so they say he appear'd at the famous
St. _Bartholomew_ Wedding at _Paris_, where, he came in dress'd up like
a Trumpeter, danc'd in his Habit, sounded a _Levet_, and then went out
and rung the Alarm-Bell (which was the Signal to begin the Massacreof all the Kinds of People, Male or Female, who set up for
_Devils_ in the World: This would be a Task for the _Devil_ indeed, and
fit only for him to undertake, for their Number is and has been
prodigious great, and may, with his other Legions be rank'd among the
Innumerable.

What a World do we inhabit! where there is not only with us a great
_Roaring-Lyon-Devil_ daily seeking whom of us he may devour, and
innumerable Millions of lesser Devils hovering in the whole Atmosphere
over us, nay, and for ought we know, other Millions always invisibly
moving about us, and perhaps in us, or at least in many of us; but that
have, besides all these, a vast many counterfeit _Hocus Pocus Devils_;
human _Devils_, who are visible among us, of our own Species and
Fraternity, conversing with us upon all Occasions; who like Mountebanks
set up their Stages in every Town, chat with us at every Tea-Table,
converse with us in every Coffee-House, and impudently tell us to our
Faces that they are Devils, boast of it, and use a thousand Tricks and
Arts to make us believe it too, and that too often with Success.

It must be confess'd there is a strong Propensity in Man's Nature,
especially the more ignorant part of Mankind, to resolve every strange
Thing, or whether really strange or no, if it be but strange to us, into
Devilism, and to say every Thing is the Devil, that they can give no
Account of.

Thus the famous Doctors of the Faculty at _Paris_, when _John Faustus_
brought the first printed Books that had then been seen in the World, or
at least seen there, into the City, and sold them for Manuscripts: They
were surpriz'd at the Performance, and question'd _Faustus_ about it;
but he affirming they were Manuscripts, and that he kept a great many
Clarks employ'd to write them, they were satisfied for a while.

But looking farther into the Work, they observ'd the exact Agreement of
every Book, one with another, that every Line stood in the same Place,
every Page a like Number of Lines, every Line a like Number of Words; if
a Word was mis-spelt in one, it was mis-spelt also in all, nay, that if
there was a Blot in one, it was alike in all; they began again to muse,
how this should be? in a Word, the learned Divines not being able to
comprehend the Thing (and that was always sufficient) concluded it must
be the _Devil_, that it was done by Magick and Witchcraft, and that in
short, poor _Faustus_ (who was indeed nothing but a meer Printer) dealt
with the _Devil_.

     N. B. _John Faustus_ was Servant, or Journeyman, or Compositor, or
        what you please to call it, to _Koster_ of _Harlem_, the first
        inventor of Printing; and having printed the Psalter, sold them at
        _Paris_ as Manuscripts; because as such they yielded a better
        Price.


But the learned Doctors not being able to understand how the Work was
perform'd, concluded as above, it was all _the Devil_, and that the Man
was a _Witch_; accordingly they took him up for a _Magician_ and a
_Conjurer_, and one that work'd by the _Black Art_, that is to say, by
the help of the _Devil_; and in a Word, they threaten'd to hang him for
a Witch, and in order to it, commenc'd a Process against him in their
criminal Courts, which made such a Noise in the World as rais'd the Fame
of poor _John Faustus_ to a frightful Height, till at last he was
oblig'd, for fear of the Gallows, to discover the whole Secret to them.

     N. B. This is the true original of the famous Dr. _Faustus_ or
        _Foster_, of whom we have believ'd such strange Things, as that it
        is become a Proverb, _as great as the_ Devil _and Dr._ Foster:
        Whereas poor _Faustus_ was no Doctor, and knew no more of the
        _Devil_ than another Body.


Thus the Magistrates of _Bern_ and _Switzerland_, finding a Gang of
_French_ Actors of Puppet-shew open'd their Stage in the Town, upon
hearing the surprizing Accounts which the People gave of their wonderful
Puppets, how they made them speak, answer Questions, and discourse,
appear and disappear in a Moment, pop up here, as if they rise out of
the Earth, and down there, as if they vanish'd, and Abundance more Feats
of Art, censur'd them as Demons; and if they had not pack'd up their
Trinkets, and disappeared almost as dextrously as their Puppets, they
had certainly condemn'd the poor Puppets to the Flames for _Devils_, and
censur'd, if not otherwise punished their Masters. See _the Count de
Rochfort's Memoirs_, p. 179.

Wonderful Operations astonish the Mind, especially where the Head is not
over-burthen'd with Brains; and Custom has made it so natural to give
the _Devil_ either the Honour or Scandal of every Thing, that we cannot
otherwise Account for, that it is not possible to put the People out of
the Road of it.

The _Magicians_ were, in the _Chaldean_ Monarchy, call'd the Wisemen;
and tho' they are joined with the Sorcerers and Astrologers in the same
Place, _Dan._ ii. 4. yet they were generally so understood among those
People; but in our Language we understand them to be People that have an
Art to reveal Secrets, interpret Dreams, foretel Events, _&c._ and that
use Enchantments and Sorceries, by all which we understand the same
Thing; which now in a more vulgar Way we express by one general coarse
Expression, _Dealing with the_ DEVIL.

The Scripture speaks of a Spirit of _Divination_, _Acts_ xvi. 16. and a
Wench that was possess'd by this Spirit _brought her Master much Gain by
Southsaying_, that is to say, according to the Learned, by _Oracling_ or
answering Questions; whence you will see in the Margin, that this
southsaying _Devil_ is there call'd _Python_, that is, _Apollo_, who is
often call'd _Python_, and who at the Oracle of _Delphos_ gave out such
Answers and _double Entendres_, as this Wench possibly did; and hence
all those Spirits which were call'd Spirits of Divination, were in
another Sense call'd _Pythons_.

Now when the Apostle St. _Paul_ came to see this Creature, this Spirit
takes upon it to declare that _those Men_, meaning St. _Paul_ and
_Timotheus_, _were the Servants of the most high God, which shew'd unto
them the Way of Salvation_; this was a good turn of the _Devil_, to
preserve his Authority in the possess'd Girl; she brought them Gain by
Southsaying, that is to say, resolving difficult Questions, answering
Doubts, interpreting Dreams, _&c._ Among these Doubts, he makes her give
Testimony to _Paul_ and _Timotheus_, to wheedle in with the new
Christians, and perhaps (tho' very ignorantly) even with _Paul_ and
_Timotheus_ themselves, so to give a Kind of Credit and Respect to her
for speaking.

But the _Devil_, who never speaks Truth, but with some sinister End, was
discover'd here and detected; his flattering Recognition not accepted,
and he himself unkennel'd as he deserv'd; there the _Devil_ was
over-shot in his own Bow again.

Here now was a real Possession, and the evil Spirits who possess'd her,
did stoop to sundry little Acts of Servitude, that we could give little
or no Reason for, only that the Girl's Master might get Money by her;
but perhaps this was a particular Case, and, prepar'd to honour the
Authority and Power the Apostles had over evil Spirits.

But we find these Things carried a great Way farther in many Cases, that
is to say, where the Parties are thus really possess'd; namely, the
_Devil_ makes Agents of the possess'd Parties to do many Things for the
propagating his Interest and Kingdom, and particularly for the carrying
on his Dominion in the World: But I am for the present not so much upon
the real Possession as the pretended, and particularly we have had many
that have believed themselves possess'd, when the _Devil_ never believed
it of them, and perhaps knew them better; some of these are really poor
_Devils_ to be pitied, and are what I call _Diables Imaginaire_; these
have notwithstanding done the _Devil_ good Service, and brought their
Masters good Gain by Southsaying.

We find Possessions acknowledg'd in Scripture to be really and
personally the _Devil_, or according to the Text, Legions of _Devils_ in
the Plural. The _Devil_ or _Devils_ rather, which possessed the Man
among the Tombs, is positively affirm'd to be the _Devil_ in the
Scripture; all the Evangelists agree in calling him so, and his very
Works shew it; namely, the Mischief he did, as well to the poor Creature
among the Tombs, who was made so fierce, that he was the Terror of all
the Country, as to the Herd of Swine and to the Country in the Loss of
them.

I might preach you a Lecture here of the _Devil_'s Terror upon the
Approach of our Saviour, the Dread of his Government, and how he
acknowledg'd that there was a Time for his Torment, which was not yet
come: _Art thou come to torment us before our Time?_ It is evident the
Devil apprehended that Christ would chain them up before the Day of
Judgment; and therefore some think the Devil here, being, as it were,
caught out of his due Bounds, possessing the poor Man in such a furious
manner, was afraid, and petition'd Christ not to chain him up for it,
and as the Text says, _They besought him to suffer them to go away_, &c.
that is to say, when they say, art thou come to torment us before the
Time? the Meaning is, they begg'd he would not cast them into Torment
before the Time, which was already fix'd; but that if he would cast them
out of the Man, he would let them go away, _&c._

The Evangelist St. _Luke_ says, the _Devil besought him that he would
not command them to go out into the Deep_: Our learned Annotators think
that part is not rightly render'd; adding, that they do not believe the
_Devil_ fears drowning; but with Submission, I believe the meaning is,
that they would not be confin'd to the vast Ocean, where no Inhabitants
being to be seen, they would be effectually imprison'd and tied down
from doing Mischief, which would be a Hell to them; as to their going
into the Swine, that might afford us some Allegory; but I am not
disposed to jest with the Scripture, no nor with the _Devil_ neither,
farther than needs must.

It is evident the _Devil_ makes Use of very mean Instruments sometimes,
such as the Damsel possess'd with a Spirit of Divination, and several
others.

I remember a Story, how true I know not, of a weak Creature next Door to
an Ideot, who was establish'd in the Country for an Oracle, and would
tell People strange Things that should be, long before they came to
pass; when People were sick, would tell them whether they should live or
die; if People were married, tell how many Children they should have;
and a hundred such Things as fill'd the People with Admiration, and they
were the easier brought to believe that the Girl was possess'd; but then
they were divided about her too, and that was the finest spun Thread
the Devil could work, for he carried a great Point in it; some said she
had a good Spirit, and some a bad, some said she was a Prophetess, and
some that she was the _Devil_.

Now had I been there to decide the Question, I should certainly have
given it for the latter; if it were only upon this Account, namely, that
the Devil has often found Fools very necessary Agents for the
propagating his Interest and Kingdom, but we never knew the good Spirits
do so; on the other Hand, it does not seem likely that Heaven should
deprive a poor Creature of its Senses, and as it were take her Soul from
her, and then make her an Instrument of Instruction to others, and an
Oracle to declare his Decrees by; this does not seem to be rational.

But as far as this kind of Divination is in Use in our Days, yet I do
not find room to charge the Devil with making any great Use of Fools,
unless it be such as he has particularly qualified for his Work, for as
to _Ideots_ and _Naturals_, they are perfectly useless to him; but a
sort of Fools call'd the Magi, indeed, we have some Reason to think he
often works with.

We are not arriv'd to a certainty yet, in the settling this great Point,
namely, what Magick is? whether a diabolical Art or a Branch of the
Mathematicks? Our most learned _Lexicon Technicum_ is of the latter
Opinion, and gives the _Magic Square_ and the _Magic Lantern_, two Terms
of Art.

The _Magic Square_ is when Numbers in _Arithmetical Proportion_ are
dispos'd into such Parallels or equal Ranks, as that the Sums of each
Row as well _Diagonally_ as _Laterally_ shall be all equal; for Example,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Place these Nine in a Square of three, they
will _directly_ and _diagonally_ make 18. Thus,

  +------------+
  | 5 | 10 | 3 |
  -------------|
  | 4 |  6 | 8 |
  -------------|
  | 9 |  2 | 7 |
  +------------+

This he calls the _Magic Square_, but gives no Reason for the Term, nor
any Account of what infernal Operations are wrought by this Concurrence
of the Numbers; neither do I see that there can be any such Use made of
it.

The _Magic Lantern_ is an optic Machine, by the Means of which are
represented, on a Wall in the Dark, many Phantasms and terrible
Appearances, _but no_ Devil _in all this_, only that they are taken for
the Effects of Magic, by those that are not acquainted with the Secret.

All this is done by the help of several little painted Pieces of Glass,
only so and so situated, plac'd in certain Oppositions to one another,
and painted with different Figures, the most formidable being plac'd
foremost, and such as are most capable of terrifying the Spectators; and
by this all the Figures may be represented upon the opposite Wall, in
the largest Size.

I cannot but take Notice, that this very Piece of optic Delusion seems
too much akin to the mock Possessions and infernal Accomplishments,
which most of the Possessionists of this Age pretend to, so that they
are most of them meer Phantasms and Appearances, and no more; Nor is the
Spirit of Divination, the Magic, the Necromancing, and other Arts which
were call'd Diabolical, found to be of any Use in modern Practice, at
least, in these Parts of the World; but the Devil seems to do most of
his Work himself, and by shorter Methods; for he has so compleat an
Influence among those that he now Lists in his Service, that he brings
all the common Affairs of Mankind into a narrower Compass in his
Management, with a Dexterity particular to himself, and by which he
carries on his Interest silently and surely, much more to the Detriment
of Virtue and good Government, and consequently much more to his
Satisfaction, than ever he did before.

There is a Kind of _Magic_ or _Sorcery_, or what else you may please to
call it, which, tho' unknown to us, is yet, it seems, still very much
encourag'd by the _Devil_; but this is a great Way off, and in Countries
where the politer Instruments, which he finds here, are not to be had;
namely, among the _Indians_ of _North-America_; This is call'd
_Pawawing_, and they have their Divines, which they call _Pawaws_ or
Witches, who use strange Gestures, Distortions, horrid Smokes, Burnings,
and Scents, and several such Things which the Sorcerers and Witches in
ancient Times are said to use in casting Nativities, in Philtres, and in
determining, or as they pretended, directing the Fate of Persons; by
burning such and such Herbs and Roots, such as _Helebore_, _Wormwood_,
_Storax_, _Devilwort_, _Mandrake_, _Nightshade_, and Abundance more
such, which are call'd noxious Plants, or the Product of noxious Plants;
also melting such and such Minerals, Gums, and poisonous Things, and by
several hellish Mutterings and Markings over them, the like do these
_Pawaws_; and the _Devil_ is pleased, it seems, (or is permitted) to
fall in with these Things, and as some People think, appears often to
them for their Assistance upon those Occasions.

But be that as it will, he is eas'd of all that Trouble here; he can
_Pawaw_ here himself, without their aid, and having laid them all aside,
he negotiates much of his Business without Ambassadors; he is his own
Plenipotentiary, for he finds Man so easy to come at, and so easy when
he is come at, that he stands in no need of secret Emissaries, or at
least not so much as he used to do.

Upon the whole, as the World, within the Compass of a few pass'd Years
is advanc'd in all Kinds of Knowledge and Arts, and every useful Branch
of what they knew before improv'd, and innumerable useful Parts of
Knowledge, which were conceal'd before are discover'd; why should we
think the _Devil_ alone should stand at a stay, has taken no Steps to
his farther Accomplishment, and made no useful Discoveries in his Way?
That he alone should stand at a Stay, and be just the same unimprov'd
Devil that he was before? No, no, as the World is improv'd every Day,
and every Age is grown wiser and wiser than their Fathers; so, no doubt,
he has bestirr'd himself too, in order to an encrease of Knowledge and
Discovery, and that he finds every Day a nearer Way to go to work with
Mankind than he had before.

Besides, as Men in general seem to have alter'd their manner, and that
they move in a higher and more exalted Sphere, especially as to Vice and
Virtue; so the _Devil_ may have been obliged to change his Measures, and
alter his Way of working; particularly, those Things which would take in
former Times, and which a stupid Age would come easily into, won't go
down with us now: As the taste of Vice and Virtue alters, the _Devil_ is
forc'd to bait his Hook with new Compositions; the very Thing call'd
Temptation is alter'd in its Nature, and that which serv'd to delude our
Ancestors, whose gross Conceptions of Things caused them to be
manageable with less Art, will not do now; the Case is quite alter'd; in
some Things, perhaps, as I hinted above, we come into Crime with ease,
and may be led by a Finger; but when we come to a more refin'd Way of
sinning, which our Ancestors never understood, other and more refin'd
Politics must be made Use of, and the _Devil_ has been put upon many
useful Projects and Inventions, to make many new Discoveries and
Experiments to carry on his Affairs; and to speak impartially, he is
strangely improv'd either in Knowledge or Experiment, within these few
Years; he has found out a great many new Inventions to shorten his own
Labour, and carry on his Business in the World currently, which he never
was master of before, or at least we never knew he was.

No wonder then that he has chang'd Hands too, and that he has left of
pawawing in these Parts of the World; that we don't find our Houses
disturb'd as they used to be, and the Stools and Chairs walking about
out of one Room into another, as formerly; that Children don't vomit
crooked Pins and rusty stub Nails, as of old, the Air is not full of
Noises, nor the Church-Yard full of Hobgoblins; Ghosts don't walk about
in Winding-Sheets, and the good old scolding Wives visit and plague
their Husbands after they are dead, as they did when they were alive.

The Age is grown too wise to be agitated by these dull scare-crow Things
which their Fore-Fathers were tickled with; _Satan_ has been obliged to
lay by his Puppet-shews and his Tumblers, those things are grown stale;
his morrice-dancing Devils, his mountebanking and quacking won't do now;
those Things, as they may be supposed to be very troublesome to him,
(and but that he has Servants enough would be chargeable too) are now of
no great Use in the new Management of his Affairs.

_In a Word_, Men are too much Devils themselves, in the Sense that I
have call'd them so, to be frighted with such little low priz'd
Appearances as these; they are better acquainted with the old
Arch-Angel than so, and they seem to tell him they must be treated after
another manner, and that then, as they are good-natur'd and tractable,
he may deal with them upon better Terms.

Hence the _Devil_ goes to work with Mankind a much shorter Way; for
instead of the Art of Wheedling and Whining, together with the laborious
Part of Tricking and Sharping, Hurrying and Driving, Frighting and
Terrifying, all which the _Devil_ was put to the Trouble of before; in
short, he acts the GRAND MANNER as the Architects call it (I don't know
whether our Free-Masons may understand the Word) and therefore I may
hereafter explain it, as it is to be Diabolically as well as
mathematically understood.

At present my meaning is, he acts with them immediately and personally
by a magnificent Transformation, making them meer _Devils_ to
themselves, upon all needful Occasions, and _Devils_ to one another too,
whenever he (Satan), has Need of their Service.

This Way of embarking Mankind in the _Devil_'s particular Engagement, is
really very modern; and tho' the Devil himself may have been long
acquainted with the Method, and as I have heard, began to practise it
towards the Close of the _Roman_ Empire, when Men began to act upon very
polite Principles, and were capable of the most refin'd Wickedness, and
afterwards with some Popes, who likewise were a kind of Church Devils,
such as Satan himself could hardly expect to find in the World; yet I do
not find that he was ever able to bring it into Practice, at least, not
so universally as he does now: But now the Case is alter'd, and Men
being generally more expert in Wickedness than they were formerly; they
suffer the smaller Alteration of the Species, in being transmigrated;
in a Word, they turn into _Devils_, with no trouble at all hardly,
either to the _Devil_ or to themselves.

This Particular would want much the less Explanation, could I obtain a
License from Sir _Hellebore Wormwood_, Bart. or from my Lord
_Thwartover_, Baron of _Scoundrel Hall_ in the Kingdom of _Ireland_, to
write the true History of their own Conduct; and how early, and above
all, how easily they commenc'd _Devils_, without the least Impeachment
of their Characters, as wise Men, and without any Diminution of that
Part of their Denomination which establish'd them for Fools.

How many mad Fellows appear among us every Day in the critical Juncture
of their Transmigration, just when they have so much of the Man left as
to be known by their Names, and enough of the _Devil_ taken up to settle
their Characters? This Easiness of the _Devil_'s access to these People,
and the great Convenience it is to him in his general Business, is a
Proof to me that he has no more Occasion of Diviners, Magicians,
Sorcerers, and whatever else we please to call those People who were
formerly so great with him; for what Occasion has he to employ _Devils_
and Wizards to confound Mankind, when he is arriv'd to such a Perfection
of Art as to bring Men, at least in these Parts of the World, to do it
all themselves; upon this Account we do not find any of the old
Sorcerers and Diviners, Magicians or Witches appear among us; not that
the _Devil_ might not be as well able to employ such People as formerly,
and qualify them for the Employment too, but that really there is no
need of them hereabout, the _Devil_ having a shorter Way, and Mankind
being much more easily possess'd; not the old _Herd of Swine_ were
sooner agitated, tho' there was full 2000 of them together; Nature has
open'd the Door, and the _Devil_ has egress and regress at Pleasure, so
that Witches and Diviners are quite out of the Question.

Nor let any Man be alarm'd at this Alteration, in the Case as it stands
between Mankind and the _Devil_, and think the _Devil_ having gain'd so
much Ground, may in time, by Encroachment, come to a general Possession
of the whole Race, and so we should all come to be _Devils_ incarnate; I
say, let us not be alarm'd, for Satan does not get these Advantages by
Encroachment, and by his infernal Power or Art, no not at all; but 'tis
the Man himself does it by his Indolence and Negligence on one Hand, and
his Complaisance to the _Devil_ on the other; and both Ways he, as it
were, opens the Door to him, beckons him with his very Hand to come in,
and the Devil has nothing to do but enter and take Possession: Now if it
be so, and Man is so frank to him; you know the _Devil_ is no Fool not
to take the Advantage when 'tis offer'd him, and therefore 'tis no
wonder if the Consequences which I have been just now naming follow.

But let no Man be discourag'd by this, from reaffirming his natural and
religious Powers, and venturing to shut the _Devil_ out; for the Case is
plain he may be shut out; the Soul is a strong Castle, and has a good
Garrison plac'd within to defend it; if the Garrison behave well, and do
their Duty, it is impregnable, and the cowardly _Devil_ must raise his
Siege and be gone; nay, he must fly, or, as we call it, make his Escape,
lest he be laid by the Heels, that is, lest his Weakness be exposed, and
all his Lurking, lying in Wait, ambuscade-Tricks; this Part would bear a
great Enlargement, but I have not room to be witty upon him, so you must
take it in the Gross, the DEVIL lies at _Blye Bush_, as our Country
People call it, to watch your coming out of your Hold; and if you happen
to go abroad unarm'd he seizes upon and masters you with ease.

Unarm'd, you'll say, what Arms should I take? what Fence against a
Flail? What Weapons can a Man take to fight the _Devil_? I could tell
you what to fight him with, and what you might fright him with, for the
_Devil_ is to be frighted with several Things besides _Holy Water_; but
'tis too serious for you, and you'll tell me I am a preaching and a
canting, and the like; so I must let the _Devil_ manage you rather than
displease you with talking Scripture and Religion.

Well, but may not the _Devil_ be fought with some of his own Weapons? Is
there no dealing with him in a Way of human Nature? This would require a
long answer, and some Philosophy might be acted, or at least imitated,
and some Magic, perhaps; for they tells us there are Spells to draw away
even the Devil himself; as in some Places they nail Horse-Shoes upon the
Threshold of the Door, to keep him out; in other Places old pieces of
Flint, with so many Holes and so many Corners, and the like: But I must
answer in the Negative, I don't know what _Satan_ might be scar'd at in
those Days, but he is either grown cunninger since or bolder, for he
values none of those Things now; I question much whether he would value
St. _Dunstan_ and his red hot Tongs, if he was to meet him now, or St.
_Francis_ or any of the Saints, no not the Host itself in full
Procession; and therefore, tho' you don't care I should preach, yet in
short, if you are afraid he should charge upon you and attack you, if
you won't make Use of those Scripture Weapons I should have mention'd,
and which you may hear of, if you enquire at _Eph._ vi. 16. you must
look for better where you think you can find them.

But to go on with my Work, the Devil, I say, is not to be fear'd with
Maukins, nor does he employ his old Instruments, but does much of his
Work himself without Instruments.

And yet I must enter a Caveat here too, against being misunderstood in
my saying the Devil stands in no need of Agents; for when I speak so, I
am to be taken in a limited Sense; I don't say he needs them no where,
but only that he does not need them in those polite Parts of the World
which I have been speaking of, and perhaps not much here; but in many
remote Countries 'tis otherwise still; the _Indians_ of _America_ are
particularly said to have Witches among them, as well in those Countries
where the _Spaniards_ and the _English_ and other Nations have planted
themselves, as amongst those where the _European_ Nations seldom come:
_for Example_, the People of _Canada_, that is, of the Countries under
the _French_ Government of _Quebeck_, the Equimeaux, and other Northern
Climates, have Magicians, Wizards and Witches, who they call _Pilloatas_
or _Pillotoas_; these pretend they speak intimately and familiarly with
the Devil, and receive from him the Knowledge of Things to come; all
which, by the Way, I take to be little more than this; that these
Fellows being a little more cunning than the rest, think, that by
pretending to something more than human, they shall make the stronger
Impressions on the ignorant People; as _Mahomet_ amus'd the World with
his Pigeon, using it to pick Peas out of his Ear, and persuaded the
People it brought him superior Revelations and Inspirations from
Paradise.

Thus these _Pillotoas_ gaining an Opinion among the People, behave like
so many Mountebanks of Hell, pretending to understand dark Things, cure
Diseases, practise Surgery, Physick and Necromancy altogether; I will
not say, but _Satan_ may pick out such Tools to work with, and I believe
does in those Parts, but I think he has found a nearer Way to the Wood
with us, and that is sufficient to my present Purpose.

Some would persuade me the _Devil_ had a great Hand in the late
religious Breaches in _France_, among the Clergy, (_viz._) about the
Pope's Constitution _Unigenitus_, and that he made a fair Attempt to set
the Pope and the _Gallican_ Church together by the Ears, for they were
all just upon the Point or breaking out into a Church War, that for
ought we knew might have gone farther than the _Devil_ himself car'd it
should; now I am of the quite contrary Opinion, I believe the _Devil_
really did not make the Breach, but rather heal'd it, for fear it should
have gone so far among them as to have set them all in a Flame, and have
open'd the Door to the Return of the _Hugonots_ again, which it was in a
fair Way to have done.

But be it one Way or t'other, the historical Part seems to be a little
against me; for 'tis certain, the _Devil_ both wanted and made Use of
Legions of Agents, as well human as infernal, visible and invisible in
that great and important Affair, and we cannot doubt but he has
innumerable Instruments still at work about it.

Like as in _Poland_, I make no Question but the _Devil_ has thousands of
his Banditti at work at this Time, and in another Country not far from
it, perhaps, preparing Matters for the next General Diet, taking care to
prevent giving any Relaxation to the Protestants, and to justify the
moderate Executions at _Thorn_, to excite a Nation to quarrel with every
Body who are able to fight with no body; to erect the Apostate Race of
_S----y_ upon a Throne which they have no Title to, and turn an elective
Throne into an hereditary, in favour of Popery.

I might anticipate all your Objections, by granting the busy _Devil_ at
this Time employing all his Agents and Instruments (for I never told you
they were idle and useless) in striving to enflame the Christian World,
and bring a new War to overspread _Europe_; I might, perhaps, point out
to you some of the Measures he takes, the Provocatives which his State
Physicians administer to the Courts and Counsellors of Princes, to
foment and ferment the Spirits, and Members of Nations, Kingdoms,
Empires and States in the World, in order to bring these glorious Ends
of Blood and War to pass; for you cannot think but he that knows so much
of the _Devil_'s Affairs, as to write his History, must know something
of all these Matters more than those that do not know so much as he.

But all this is remote to the present Case, for this is no Impeachment
of Satan's new Methods with Mankind, in this Part of the World, and in
his private and separate Capacity; all this only signifies that in his
more general and national Affairs, the _Devil_ acts still by his old
Methods; and when he is to seduce or embroil Nations, he, like other
Conquerors, subdues them by Armies, employs mighty Squadrons of
_Devils_, and sends out strong Detachments, with Generals and
Generalissimos to lead them, some to one Part of the World, some to
another; some to influence one Nation, some to manage and direct
another, according as Business presents, and his Occasions require, that
his Affairs may be carried on currently, and to his Satisfaction.

If it were not thus, but that the _Devil_ by his new and exquisite
Management, of which I have said so much, had brought Mankind in general
to be the Agents of their own Mischiefs, and that the World were so at
his Beck, that he need but command them to go and fight, declare War,
raise Armies, destroy Cities, Kingdoms, Countries and People; the World
would be a Field of Blood indeed, and all Things would run into
Confusion presently.

But this is not the Case at all, Heaven has not let go the Government of
the Creation to his subdu'd Enemy, the Devil; that would overturn the
whole System of God, and give Satan more Power, than ever he was or will
be vested with; when, therefore, I speak of a few forward Wretches in
our Day, who are so warm in their Wickedness, that they anticipate the
Devil, save him the Trouble to tempt, turn Devils to themselves, and
gallop Hellward faster than he drives; I speak of them as single
Persons, and acting in their own personal and private Capacity, but when
I speak of Nations and Kingdoms, there the Devil is oblig'd to go on in
the old Road, and act by Stratagem, by his proper Machinery, and to make
use of all his Arts, and all his Agents, just as he has done in all
Ages, from the beginning of his politic Government to this Day.

And if it was not thus too, what would become of all his numberless
Legions, of which all Ages have heard so much, and all Parts of the
World have had so much fatal Experience? They would seem to be quite out
of Employment, and be render'd useless in the World of Spirits, where it
is to be supposed they reside; not the Devil himself could find any
Business for them, which by the Way, to busy and mischievous Spirits, as
they are, would be a Hell to them, even before their Time; they would
be, as it were, doom'd to a State of Inactivity, which we may suppose
was one Part of their Expulsion from Blessedness and the Creation of
Man; or as they were for the surprising Interval between the Destruction
of Mankind by the Deluge and _Noah_'s coming out of the Ark, when
indeed they might be said to have nothing at all to do.

But this is not Satan's Case, and therefore let me tell you too, that
you may not think I treat the Case with more Levity than I really do,
and than I am sure I intend to do; tho' it is too true that our modern
and modish Sinners have arrived to more exquisite Ways of being wicked,
than their Fathers, and really seem, as I have said, to need no Devil to
tempt them; nay, that they do Satan's Work for him as to others also,
and make themselves Devils to their Neighbours, tempting others to crime
even faster than the Devil desires them, running before they are sent,
and going of the _Devil_'s Errands _gratis_; by which Means Satan's Work
is, as to them, done to his Hand, and they may be said to save him a
great deal of Trouble; yet after all, the Devil has still a great deal
of Business upon his Hands, and as well himself as all his Legions, find
themselves a full Employment in disturbing the World, and opposing the
Glory and Kingdom of their great Superior, whose Kingdom it is their
whole Business, however vain in its End, to overthrow and destroy, if
they were able, or at least to endeavour it.

This being the Case, it follows of course that the general Mischiefs of
Mankind, as well national and public, as family Mischiefs, and even
personal, (except as before excepted) lie all still at the _Devil_'s
Door, as much as ever, let his Advocates bring him off of it if they
can; and this brings us back again to the manner of the Devil's
Management, and the Way of his working by human Agents, or if you will,
the Way of human Devils, working in Affairs of low Life, such as we call
Divination, Sorcery, Black-Art, Necromancy, and the like; all which I
take to consist of two material Parts, and both very necessary for us to
be rightly inform'd of.

     1. The Part which Satan by himself or his inferior _Devils_
     empowers such People to do, as he is in Confederacy with here on
     Earth; to whom he may be said, like the Master of an Opera or
     Comedy, to give their Parts to act, and to qualify them to act it;
     whether he obliges them to a Rehearsal in his Presence, to try
     their Talents, and see that they are capable of performing, that
     indeed I have not enquir'd into.

     2. That Part which these empower'd People do voluntier or beyond
     their Commission, to shew their Diligence in the Service of their
     new Master, and either (1.) to bring Grist to their own Mill, and
     make their Market of their Employment in the best manner they can;
     or (2.) to gain Applause, be admir'd, wonder'd at, and applauded,
     as if they were ten Times more _Devils_ than really they are.


In a Word, the Matter consists of what the _Devil_ does by the Help of
these People, and what they do in his Name without him; the Devil is
sometimes cheated in his own Business; there are Pretenders to
Witchcraft and Black-Art, who Satan never made any Bargain with, but who
he connives at, because at least they do his Cause no harm, tho' their
Business is rather to get Money, than to render him any Service, of
which I gave you a remarkable Instance before.

But to go back to his real Agents, of which I reckon two.

     1. Those who act by Direction and Confederacy, as I have said
     already many do.

     2. Those whom he acts in and by, and they (perhaps) know it not, of
     which Sort History gives us plenty of Examples, from _Machiavel_'s
     first Disciple ---- to the famous Cardinal _Alberoni_, and even to
     some more modern than his Eminence, of whom I can say no more till
     farther Occasion offers.


1. Those who act by immediate Direction of the Devil, and in Confederacy
with him; these are such as I mention'd in the beginning of this
Chapter, whose Arts are truly black, because really infernal; it will be
very hard to decide the Dispute between those who really act thus in
Confederacy with the _Devil_, and those who only pretend to it; so I
shall leave that Dispute where I find it; but that there are, or at
least have been, a Set of People in the World, who really are of his
Acquaintance, and very intimate with him; and tho', as I have said, he
has much alter'd his Schemes and chang'd Hands of late; yet that there
are such People, perhaps of all Sorts; and that the Devil keeps up his
Correspondence with them; I must not venture to deny that Part, lest I
bring upon me the whole Posse of the conjuring and bewitching Crew, Male
and Female, and they should mob me for pretending to deny them the
Honour of dealing with the _Devil_, which they are so exceeding willing
to have the Fame of.

Not that I am hereby oblig'd to believe all the strange Things the
Witches and Wizards, who have been allow'd to be such, nay, who have
been hang'd for it, have said of themselves; nay, that they have
confess'd of themselves, even at the Gallows; and if I come to have an
Occasion to speak freely of the Matter, I may perhaps convince you that
the Devil's possessing Power is much lessen'd of late, and that he
either is limited, and his Fetter shortened more than it has been, or
that he does not find the old Way (as I said before) so fit for his
Purpose as he did formerly, and therefore takes other Measures, but I
must adjourn that to a Time and Place by itself: But we are told that
there are another Sort of People, and, perhaps, a great many of them
too, in whom and by whom the Devil really acts, and they know it not.

It would take up a great deal of Time and Room, too much for this Place,
so near the Close of this Work, to describe and mark out the involuntary
_Devils_ which there are in the World; of whom it may be truly said,
that really the _Devil_ is in them, and they know it not: Now, tho' the
_Devil_ is cunning and managing, and can be very silent where he finds
it for his Interest not to be known; yet it is very hard for him to
conceal himself, and to give so little Disturbance in the House, as that
the Family should not know who lodged in it; yet, I say, the Devil is so
subtle and so mischievous an Agent, that he uses all manner of Methods
and Craft to reside in such People as he finds for his Purpose, whether
they will or no, and which is more, whether they know it or no.

And let none of my Readers be angry or think themselves ill used, when I
tell them the Devil may be in them, and may act them, and by them, and
they not know it; for I must add, it may, perhaps, be one of the
greatest Pieces of human Wisdom in the World, for a Man to know when the
Devil is in him, and when not; when he is a Tool and Agent of Hell, and
when he is not; in a Word, when he is doing the Devil's Work, and under
his Direction, and when not.

It is true, this is a very weighty Point, and might deserve to be
handled in a more serious Way than I seem to be talking in all this
Book; but give me leave to talk of Things my own way, and withall, to
tell you, that there is no Part of this Work so seemingly ludicrous, but
a grave and well weigh'd Mind may make a serious and solid Application
of it, if they please; nor is there any Part of this Work, in which a
clear Sight and a good Sense may not see that the Author's Design is,
that they should do so; and as I am now so near the End of my Book, I
thought it was meet to tell you so, and lead you to it as far as I can.

I say, 'tis a great Part of human Wisdom to know when the _Devil_ is
acting in us and by us, and when not; the next and still greatest Part
would be to prevent him, put a Stop to his Progress, bid him go about
his Business, and let him know he should carry on his Designs no farther
in that manner; that we will be his Tools no longer; in short, to turn
him out of Doors, and bring a stronger Power to take Possession; but
this, indeed, is too solid a Subject, and too great to begin with here.

But now, as to the bare knowing when he is at work with us, I say this,
tho' it is considerable, may be done, nor is it so very difficult; _for
Example_, you have no more to do but look a little into the Microcosm of
the Soul, and see there how the Passions which are the Blood, and the
Affections which are the Spirit, move in their particular Vessels; how
they circulate, and in what Temper the Pulse beats there, and you may
easily see who turns the Wheel; if a perfect Calm possesses the Soul; if
Peace and Temper prevail, and the Mind feels no Tempests rising; if the
Affections are regular and exalted to vertuous and sublime Objects, the
Spirits cool, and the Mind sedate, the Man is in a general Rectitude of
Mind, he may be truly said to be _his own Man_; Heaven shines upon his
Soul with its benign Influences, and he is out of the Reach of the evil
Spirit; for the divine Spirit is an Influence of Peace, all calm and
bright, happy and sweet like it self, and tending to every Thing that is
good both present and future.

But on the other Hand, if at any Time the Mind is ruffled, if Vapours
rise, Clouds gather, if Passions swell the Breast, if Anger, Envy,
Revenge, Hatred, Wrath, Strife; if these, or any of these hover over
you, much more if you feel them within you; if the Affections are
possess'd, and the Soul hurried down the Stream to embrace low and base
Objects; if those Spirits, which are the Life and enlivening Powers of
the Soul, are drawn off to Parties, and to be engag'd in a vicious and
corrupt manner, shooting out wild and wicked Desires, and running the
Man headlong into Crime, the Case is easily resolv'd, the Man is
possess'd, the _Devil_ is in him; and having taken the Fort, or at least
the Counterscarp and Out-Works, is making his Lodgment to cover and
secure himself in his Hold, that he may not be dispossess'd.

Nor can he be easily dispossess'd when he has got such hold as this; and
'tis no wonder, that being lodg'd thus upon the Out-Works of the Soul he
continues to sap the Foundation of the rest, and by his incessant and
furious Assaults, reduces the Man at last to a Surrender.

If the Allegory be not as just and apposite as you would have it be, you
may, however, see by it in a full View, the State of the Man, and how
the _Devil_ carries on his Designs; nothing is more common, and I
believe there are few thinking Minds but may reflect upon it in their
own Compass, than for our Passions and Affections to flow out of the
ordinary Channel; the Spirits and Blood of the Soul to be extravasated,
the Passions grow violent and outragious, the Affections impetuous,
corrupt and violently vicious: Whence does all this proceed? from Heaven
we can't pretend it comes; if we must not say 'tis the _Devil_, whose
Door must it lie at? Pride swells the Passions; Avarice moves the
Affections; and what is Pride, and what is Avarice, but the _Devil_ in
the Inside of the Man? ay, as personally and really as ever he was in
the Herd of Swine.

Let not any Man then, who is a Slave to his Passions, or who is chain'd
down to his Covetousness, pretend to take it ill, when I say he has the
_Devil_ in him, or that he is a _Devil_: What else can it be, and how
comes it to pass that Passion and Revenge so often dispossess the Man of
himself, as to lead him to commit Murther, to lay Plots and Snares for
the Life of his Enemies, and so to thirst for Blood? How comes this but
by the Devil's putting those Spirits of the Soul into so violent a
Ferment, into a Fever? that the Circulation is precipitated to that
Degree, and that the Man too is precipitated into Mischief, and at last
into Ruin; 'tis all the _Devil_, tho' the Man does not know it.

In like manner Avarice leads him to rob, plunder and destroy for Money,
and to commit sometimes the worst of Violences to obtain the wicked
Reward. How many have had their Throats cut for their Money, have been
murther'd on the Highway, or in their Beds, for the Desire of what they
had? It is the same Thing in other Articles, every Vice is the Devil in
a Man; Lust of Rule is the _Devil_ of great Men, and that Ambition is
their _Devil_ as much as whoring is Father ------'s _Devil_, one has a
_Devil_ of one Class acting him, one another, and every Man's reigning
Vice is a _Devil_ to him.

Thus the _Devil_ has his involuntary Instruments, as well as those who
act in Confederacy with him; he has a very great Share in many of us,
and acts us, and in us, unknown to our selves tho' we know nothing of
it, and indeed tho' we may not suspect it of our selves; like _Hazael_
the _Assyrian_, who when the Prophet told him how he would act the
_Devil_ upon the poor _Israelites_, answer'd with Detestation, _is thy
Servant a Dog that he should do this Thing_, and yet he was that Dog,
and did all those cruel Things for all that; the _Devil_ acting him, or
acting in him, to make him wickeder than ever he thought it was possible
for him to be.




The CONCLUSION.

_Of the_ Devil_'s last Scene of Liberty, and what may be supposed to be
     his End, with what we are to understand of his being tormented for
     ever and ever._


As the _Devil_ is a Prince of the Power of the Air, his Kingdom is
mortal, and must have an End; and as he is call'd the God of this World,
that is, the great Usurper of the Homage and Reverence which Mankind
ought of right to pay to their Maker, so his Usurpation also, like the
World it self, must have an End: Satan is call'd the God of the World,
as Men too much prostrate and prostitute themselves to him, yet he is
not the Governor of this World; and therefore the Homage and Worship he
has from the World is an Usurpation; and this will have an End, because
the World it self will have an End; and all Mankind, as they had a
beginning in Time, so must expire and be remov'd before the End of Time.

Since then the _Devil_'s Empire is to expire and come to an End, and
that the _Devil_ himself and all his Host of _Devils_ are immortal
Seraphs, Spirits that are not embodied and cannot die, but are to remain
in being; the Question before us next will be, what is to become of him?
what is his State to be? whether is he to wander, and in what Condition
is he to remain to that Eternity to which he is still to exist?

I hope no Man will mistake me so much in what I have said as to Spirits,
which are all Flame, not being affected with Fire, as if I supposed
there was no Place of Punishment for the _Devil_, nor any Kind of
Punishment that could affect them; and so of our Spirits also when
transform'd into Flame.

I must be allow'd to speak there of that material Fire, by which, as by
an Allegory, all the Terrors of an eternal State are represented to us
in Scripture, and in the Writings of the learned Commentators, and by
which the Pain of Sense is describ'd; this, perhaps, I do not understand
as they seem to do, and therefore have said,

When we're all Flame (that is all Spirit) we shall all Fire (that is,
all such Fire as this) despise. And thus I claim to be understood.

It does not follow from hence, neither do I suggest, or so much as think
that infinite Power cannot form a something (tho' inconceivable to us
here) which shall be as tormenting, and as insupportable to a Devil, an
apostate Seraph, and to a Spirit, tho' exalted, unembodied and rarified
into _Flame_, as Fire would be to other Bodies; in which I think I am
orthodox, and do not give the least Occasion to an Enemy to charge me
with profane Speaking, in those Words, or to plead for thinking
prophanely himself.

It must be Atheistical to the last Degree to suggest, that whereas the
_Devil_ has been heaping up and amassing Guilt ever since the Creation
of Man, encreasing in hatred of God and Rebellion against him, and in
all possible endeavour to dethrone and depose the Majesty of Heaven;
that yet Heaven had not prepar'd, or could not prepare a just Penalty
for him; and that it should not all end in God's entire Victory over
Hell, and in Satan's open Condemnation: Heaven could not be just to its
own Glory, if he should not avenge himself upon this Rebel, for all his
superlative Wickedness in his modern as well as ancient Station; for the
Blood of so many millions of his faithful Subjects and Saints whom he
has destroy'd; and if nothing else offer'd it self to prove this Part,
it would appear undoubted to me; but this, I confess, does not belong to
Satan's Hi
THE LIFE OF THE LATE

MR. JONATHAN WILD


BOOK I

CHAPTER ONE

SHEWING THE WHOLESOME USES DRAWN FROM RECORDING THE ACHIEVEMENTS
OF THOSE WONDERFUL PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE CALLED GREAT MEN.


As it is necessary that all great and surprising events, the
designs of which are laid, conducted, and brought to perfection by
the utmost force of human invention and art, should be produced by
great and eminent men, so the lives of such may be justly and
properly styled the quintessence of history. In these, when
delivered to us by sensible writers, we are not only most
agreeably entertained, but most usefully instructed; for, besides
the attaining hence a consummate knowledge of human nature in
general; of its secret springs, various windings, and perplexed
mazes; we have here before our eyes lively examples of whatever is
amiable or detestable, worthy of admiration or abhorrence, and are
consequently taught, in a manner infinitely more effectual than by
precept, what we are eagerly to imitate or carefully to avoid.

But besides the two obvious advantages of surveying, as it were in
a picture, the true beauty of virtue and deformity of vice, we may
moreover learn from Plutarch, Nepos, Suetonius, and other
biographers, this useful lesson, not too hastily, nor in the
gross, to bestow either our praise or censure; since we shall
often find such a mixture of good and evil in the same character
that it may require a very accurate judgment and a very elaborate
inquiry to determine on which side the balance turns, for though
we sometimes meet with an Aristides or a Brutus, a Lysander or a
Nero, yet far the greater number are of the mixt kind, neither
totally good nor bad; their greatest virtues being obscured and
allayed by their vices, and those again softened and coloured over
by their virtues.

Of this kind was the illustrious person whose history we now
undertake; to whom, though nature had given the greatest and most
shining endowments, she had not given them absolutely pure and
without allay. Though he had much of the admirable in his
character, as much perhaps as is usually to be found in a hero, I
will not yet venture to affirm that he was entirely free from all
defects, or that the sharp eyes of censure could not spy out some
little blemishes lurking amongst his many great perfections.

We would not therefore be understood to affect giving the reader a
perfect or consummate pattern of human excellence, but rather, by
faithfully recording some little imperfections which shadowed over
the lustre of those great qualities which we shall here record, to
teach the lesson we have above mentioned, to induce our reader
with us to lament the frailty of human nature, and to convince him
that no mortal, after a thorough scrutiny, can be a proper object
of our adoration.

But before we enter on this great work we must endeavour to remove
some errors of opinion which mankind have, by the disingenuity of
writers, contracted: for these, from their fear of contradicting
the obsolete and absurd doctrines of a set of simple fellows,
called, in derision, sages or philosophers, have endeavoured, as
much as possible, to confound the ideas of greatness and goodness;
whereas no two things can possibly be more distinct from each
other, for greatness consists in bringing all manner of mischief
on mankind, and goodness in removing it from them. It seems
therefore very unlikely that the same person should possess them
both; and yet nothing is more usual with writers, who find many
instances of greatness in their favourite hero, than to make him a
compliment of goodness into the bargain; and this, without
considering that by such means they destroy the great perfection
called uniformity of character. In the histories of Alexander and
Caesar we are frequently, and indeed impertinently, reminded of
their benevolence and generosity, of their clemency and kindness.
When the former had with fire and sword overrun a vast empire, had
destroyed the lives of an immense number of innocent wretches, had
scattered ruin and desolation like a whirlwind, we are told, as an
example of his clemency, that he did not cut the throat of an old
woman, and ravish her daughters, but was content with only undoing
them. And when the mighty Caesar, with wonderful greatness of
mind, had destroyed the liberties of his country, and with all the
means of fraud and force had placed himself at the head of his
equals, had corrupted and enslaved the greatest people whom the
sun ever saw, we are reminded, as an evidence of his generosity,
of his largesses to his followers and tools, by whose means he had
accomplished his purpose, and by whose assistance he was to
establish it.

Now, who doth not see that such sneaking qualities as these are
rather to be bewailed as imperfections than admired as ornaments
in these great men; rather obscuring their glory, and holding them
back in their race to greatness, indeed unworthy the end for which
they seem to have come into the world, viz. of perpetrating vast
and mighty mischief?

We hope our reader will have reason justly to acquit us of any
such confounding ideas in the following pages; in which, as we are
to record the actions of a great man, so we have nowhere mentioned
any spark of goodness which had discovered itself either faintly
in him, or more glaringly in any other person, but as a meanness
and imperfection, disqualifying them for undertakings which lead
to honour and esteem among men.

As our hero had as little as perhaps is to be found of that
meanness, indeed only enough to make him partaker of the
imperfection of humanity, instead of the perfection of diabolism,
we have ventured to call him THE GREAT; nor do we doubt but our
reader, when he hath perused his story, will concur with us in
allowing him that title.




CHAPTER TWO

GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF AS MANY OF OUR HERO'S ANCESTORS AS CAN BE
GATHERED OUT OF THE RUBBISH OF ANTIQUITY, WHICH HATH BEEN
CAREFULLY SIFTED FOR THAT PURPOSE.


It is the custom of all biographers, at their entrance into their
work, to step a little backwards (as far, indeed, generally as
they are able) and to trace up their hero, as the ancients did the
river Nile, till an incapacity of proceeding higher puts an end to
their search.

What first gave rise to this method is somewhat difficult to
determine. Sometimes I have thought that the hero's ancestors have
been introduced as foils to himself. Again, I have imagined it
might be to obviate a suspicion that such extraordinary personages
were not produced in the ordinary course of nature, and may have
proceeded from the author's fear that, if we were not told who
their fathers were, they might be in danger, like prince
Prettyman, of being supposed to have had none. Lastly, and perhaps
more truly, I have conjectured that the design of the biographer
hath been no more than to shew his great learning and knowledge of
antiquity. A design to which the world hath probably owed many
notable discoveries, and indeed most of the labours of our
antiquarians.

But whatever original this custom had, it is now too well
established to be disputed. I shall therefore conform to it in the
strictest manner.

Mr. Jonathan Wild, or Wyld, then (for he himself did not always
agree in one method of spelling his name), was descended from the
great Wolfstan Wild, who came over with Hengist, and distinguished
himself very eminently at that famous festival, where the Britons
were so treacherously murdered by the Saxons; for when the word
was given, i.e. Nemet eour Saxes, take out your swords, this
gentleman, being a little hard of hearing, mistook the sound for
Nemet her sacs, take out their purses; instead therefore of
applying to the throat, he immediately applied to the pocket of
his guest, and contented himself with taking all that he had,
without attempting his life.

The next ancestor of our hero who was remarkably eminent was Wild,
surnamed Langfanger, or Longfinger. He flourished in the reign of
Henry III., and was strictly attached to Hubert de Burgh, whose
friendship he was recommended to by his great excellence in an art
of which Hubert was himself the inventor; he could, without the
knowledge of the proprietor, with great ease and dexterity, draw
forth a man's purse from any part of his garment where it was
deposited, and hence he derived his surname. This gentleman was
the first of his family who had the honour to suffer for the good
of his country: on whom a wit of that time made the following
epitaph:--

O shame o' justice! Wild is hang'd, For thatten he a pocket
fang'd, While safe old Hubert, and his gang, Doth pocket o' the
nation fang.

Langfanger left a son named Edward, whom he had carefully
instructed in the art for which he himself was so famous. This
Edward had a grandson, who served as a volunteer under the famous
Sir John Falstaff, and by his gallant demeanour so recommended
himself to his captain, that he would have certainly been promoted
by him, had Harry the fifth kept his word with his old companion.

After the death of Edward the family remained in some obscurity
down to the reign of Charles the first, when James Wild
distinguished himself on both sides the question in the civil
wars, passing from one to t'other, as Heaven seemed to declare
itself in favour of either party. At the end of the war, James not
being rewarded according to his merits, as is usually the case of
such impartial persons, he associated himself with a brave man of
those times, whose name was Hind, and declared open war with both
parties. He was successful in several actions, and spoiled many of
the enemy: till at length, being overpowered and taken, he was,
contrary to the law of arms, put basely and cowardly to death by a
combination between twelve men of the enemy's party, who, after
some consultation, unanimously agreed on the said murder.

This Edward took to wife Rebecca, the daughter of the above-
mentioned John Hind, esq., by whom he had issue John, Edward,
Thomas, and Jonathan, and three daughters, namely, Grace, Charity,
and Honour. John followed the fortunes of his father, and,
suffering with him, left no issue. Edward was so remarkable for
his compassionate temper that he spent his life in soliciting the
causes of the distressed captives in Newgate, and is reported to
have held a strict friendship with an eminent divine who solicited
the spiritual causes of the said captives. He married Editha,
daughter and co-heiress of Geoffry Snap, gent., who long enjoyed
an office under the high sheriff of London and Middlesex, by
which, with great reputation, he acquired a handsome fortune: by
her he had no issue. Thomas went very young abroad to one of our
American colonies, and hath not been since heard of. As for the
daughters, Grace was married to a merchant of Yorkshire who dealt
in horses. Charity took to husband an eminent gentleman, whose
name I cannot learn, but who was famous for so friendly a
disposition that he was bail for above a hundred persons in one
year. He had likewise the remarkable humour of walking in
Westminster-hall with a straw in his shoe. Honour, the youngest,
died unmarried: she lived many years in this town, was a great
frequenter of plays, and used to be remarkable for distributing
oranges to all who would accept of them.

Jonathan married Elizabeth, daughter of Scragg Hollow, of Hockley-
in-the-Hole, esq.; and by her had Jonathan, who is the illustrious
subject of these memoirs.




CHAPTER THREE

THE BIRTH, PARENTAGE, AND EDUCATION OF MR. JONATHAN WILD THE
GREAT.


It is observable that Nature seldom produces any one who is
afterwards to act a notable part on the stage of life, but she
gives some warning of her intention; and, as the dramatic poet
generally prepares the entry of every considerable character with
a solemn narrative, or at least a great flourish of drums and
trumpets, so doth this our Alma Mater by some shrewd hints pre-
admonish us of her intention, giving us warning, as it were, and
crying--

     --Venienti occurrite morbo.

Thus Astyages, who was the grandfather of Cyrus, dreamt that his
daughter was brought to bed of a vine, whose branches overspread
all Asia; and Hecuba, while big with Paris, dreamt that she was
delivered of a firebrand that set all Troy in flames; so did the
mother of our great man, while she was with child of him, dream
that she was enjoyed in the night by the gods Mercury and Priapus.
This dream puzzled all the learned astrologers of her time,
seeming to imply in it a contradiction; Mercury being the god of
ingenuity, and Priapus the terror of those who practised it. What
made this dream the more wonderful, and perhaps the true cause of
its being remembered, was a very extraordinary circumstance,
sufficiently denoting something preternatural in it; for though
she had never heard even the name of either of these gods, she
repeated these very words in the morning, with only a small
mistake of the quantity of the latter, which she chose to call
Priapus instead of Priapus; and her husband swore that, though he
might possibly have named Mercury to her (for he had heard of such
an heathen god), he never in his life could anywise have put her
in mind of that other deity, with whom he had no acquaintance.

Another remarkable incident was, that during her whole pregnancy
she constantly longed for everything she saw; nor could be
satisfied with her wish unless she enjoyed it clandestinely; and
as nature, by true and accurate observers, is remarked to give us
no appetites without furnishing us with the means of gratifying
them; so had she at this time a most marvellous glutinous quality
attending her fingers, to which, as to birdlime, everything
closely adhered that she handled.

To omit other stories, some of which may be perhaps the growth of
superstition, we proceed to the birth of our hero, who made his
first appearance on this great theatre the very day when the
plague first broke out in 1665. Some say his mother was delivered
of him in an house of an orbicular or round form in Covent-garden;
but of this we are not certain. He was some years afterwards
baptized by the famous Mr. Titus Oates.

Nothing very remarkable passed in his years of infancy, save that,
as the letters TH are the most difficult of pronunciation, and the
last which a child attains to the utterance of, so they were the
first that came with any readiness from young master Wild. Nor
must we omit the early indications which he gave of the sweetness
of his temper; for though he was by no means to be terrified into
compliance, yet might he, by a sugar-plum, be brought to your
purpose; indeed, to say the truth, he was to be bribed to
anything, which made many say he was certainly born to be a great
man.

He was scarce settled at school before he gave marks of his lofty
and aspiring temper; and was regarded by all his schoolfellows
with that deference which men generally pay to those superior
geniuses who will exact it of them. If an orchard was to be robbed
Wild was consulted, and, though he was himself seldom concerned in
the execution of the design, yet was he always concerter of it,
and treasurer of the booty, some little part of which he would now
and then, with wonderful generosity, bestow on those who took it.
He was generally very secret on these occasions; but if any
offered to plunder of his own head, without acquainting master
Wild, and making a deposit of the booty, he was sure to have an
information against him lodged with the schoolmaster, and to be
severely punished for his pains.

He discovered so little attention to school-learning that his
master, who was a very wise and worthy man, soon gave over all
care and trouble on that account, and, acquainting his parents
that their son proceeded extremely well in his studies, he
permitted his pupil to follow his own inclinations, perceiving
they led him to nobler pursuits than the sciences, which are
generally acknowledged to be a very unprofitable study, and indeed
greatly to hinder the advancement of men in the world: but though
master Wild was not esteemed the readiest at making his exercise,
he was universally allowed to be the most dexterous at stealing it
of all his schoolfellows, being never detected in such furtive
compositions, nor indeed in any other exercitations of his great
talents, which all inclined the same way, but once, when he had
laid violent hands on a book called Gradus ad Parnassum, i. e. A
step towards Parnassus, on which account his master, who was a man
of most wonderful wit and sagacity, is said to have told him he
wished it might not prove in the event Gradus ad Patibulum, i. e.
A step towards the gallows.

But, though he would not give himself the pains requisite to
acquire a competent sufficiency in the learned languages, yet did
he readily listen with attention to others, especially when they
translated the classical authors to him; nor was he in the least
backward, at all such times, to express his approbation. He was
wonderfully pleased with that passage in the eleventh Iliad where
Achilles is said to have bound two sons of Priam upon a mountain,
and afterwards to have released them for a sum of money. This was,
he said, alone sufficient to refute those who affected a contempt
for the wisdom of the ancients, and an undeniable testimony of the
great antiquity of priggism.[Footnote: This word, in the cant
language, signifies thievery.] He was ravished with the account
which Nestor gives in the same book of the rich booty which he
bore off (i.e. stole) from the Eleans. He was desirous of having
this often repeated to him, and at the end of every repetition he
constantly fetched a deep sigh, and said IT WAS A GLORIOUS BOOTY.

When the story of Cacus was read to him out of the eighth Aeneid
he generously pitied the unhappy fate of that great man, to whom
he thought Hercules much too severe: one of his schoolfellows
commending the dexterity of drawing the oxen backward by their
tails into his den, he smiled, and with some disdain said, HE
COULD HAVE TAUGHT HIM A BETTER WAY.

He was a passionate admirer of heroes, particularly of Alexander
the Great, between whom and the late king of Sweden he would
frequently draw parallels. He was much delighted with the accounts
of the Czar's retreat from the latter, who carried off the
inhabitants of great cities to people his own country. THIS, he
said, WAS NOT ONCE THOUGHT OF BY Alexander; BUT added, PERHAPS HE
DID NOT WANT THEM.

Happy had it been for him if he had confined himself to this
sphere; but his chief, if not only blemish, was, that he would
sometimes, from an humility in his nature too pernicious to true
greatness, condescend to an intimacy with inferior things and
persons. Thus the Spanish Rogue was his favourite book, and the
Cheats of Scapin his favourite play.

The young gentleman being now at the age of seventeen, his father,
from a foolish prejudice to our universities, and out of a false
as well as excessive regard to his morals, brought his son to
town, where he resided with him till he was of an age to travel.
Whilst he was here, all imaginable care was taken of his
instruction, his father endeavouring his utmost to inculcate
principles of honour and gentility into his son.




CHAPTER FOUR

MR. WILD'S FIRST ENTRANCE INTO THE WORLD. HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH
COUNT LA RUSE.

An accident soon happened after his arrival in town which almost
saved the father his whole labour on this head, and provided
master Wild a better tutor than any after-care or expense could
have furnished him with. The old gentleman, it seems, was a
FOLLOWER of the fortunes of Mr. Snap, son of Mr. Geoffry Snap,
whom we have before mentioned to have enjoyed a reputable office
under the Sheriff of London and Middlesex, the daughter of which
Geoffry had intermarried with the Wilds. Mr. Snap the younger,
being thereto well warranted, had laid violent hands on, or, as
the vulgar express it, arrested one count La Ruse, a man of
considerable figure in those days, and had confined him to his own
house till he could find two seconds who would in a formal manner
give their words that the count should, at a certain day and place
appointed, answer all that one Thomas Thimble, a taylor, had to
say to him; which Thomas Thimble, it seems, alleged that the count
had, according to the law of the realm, made over his body to him
as a security for some suits of cloaths to him delivered by the
said Thomas Thimble. Now as the count, though perfectly a man of
honour, could not immediately find these seconds, he was obliged
for some time to reside at Mr. Snap's house: for it seems the law
of the land is, that whoever owes another 10 pounds, or indeed 2
pounds, may be, on the oath of that person, immediately taken up
and carried away from his own house and family, and kept abroad
till he is made to owe, 50 pounds, whether he will or no; for
which he is perhaps afterwards obliged to lie in gaol; and all
these without any trial had, or any other evidence of the debt
than the above said oath, which if untrue, as it often happens,
you have no remedy against the perjurer; he was, forsooth,
mistaken.

But though Mr. Snap would not (as perhaps by the nice rules of
honour he was obliged) discharge the count on his parole, yet did
he not (as by the strict rules of law he was enabled) confine him
to his chamber. The count had his liberty of the whole house, and
Mr. Snap, using only the precaution of keeping his doors well
locked and barred, took his prisoner's word that he would not go
forth.

Mr. Snap had by his second lady two daughters, who were now in the
bloom of their youth and beauty. These young ladies, like damsels
in romance, compassionated the captive count, and endeavoured by
all means to make his confinement less irksome to him; which,
though they were both very beautiful, they could not attain by any
other way so effectually as by engaging with him at cards, in
which contentions, as will appear hereafter, the count was greatly
skilful.

As whisk and swabbers was the game then in the chief vogue, they
were obliged to look for a fourth person in order to make up their
parties. Mr. Snap himself would sometimes relax his mind from the
violent fatigues of his employment by these recreations; and
sometimes a neighbouring young gentleman or lady came in to their
assistance: but the most frequent guest was young master Wild, who
had been educated from his infancy with the Miss Snaps, and was,
by all the neighbours, allotted for the husband of Miss Tishy, or
Laetitia, the younger of the two; for though, being his cousin-
german, she was perhaps, in the eye of a strict conscience,
somewhat too nearly related to him, yet the old people on both
sides, though sufficiently scrupulous in nice matters, agreed to
overlook this objection.

Men of great genius as easily discover one another as freemasons
can. It was therefore no wonder that the count soon conceived an
inclination to an intimacy with our young hero, whose vast
abilities could not be concealed from one of the count's
discernment; for though this latter was so expert at his cards
that he was proverbially said to PLAY THE WHOLE GAME, he was no
match for master Wild, who, inexperienced as he was,
notwithstanding all the art, the dexterity, and often the fortune
of his adversary, never failed to send him away from the table
with less in his pocket than he brought to it, for indeed
Langfanger himself could not have extracted a purse with more
ingenuity than our young hero.

His hands made frequent visits to the count's pocket before the
latter had entertained any suspicion of him, imputing the several
losses he sustained rather to the innocent and sprightly frolick
of Miss Doshy, or Theodosia, with which, as she indulged him with
little innocent freedoms about her person in return, he thought
himself obliged to be contented; but one night, when Wild imagined
the count asleep, he made so unguarded an attack upon him, that
the other caught him in the fact: however, he did not think proper
to acquaint him with the discovery he had made, but, preventing
him from any booty at that time, he only took care for the future
to button his pockets, and to pack the cards with double industry.

So far was this detection from causing any quarrel between these
two prigs,[Footnote: Thieves] that in reality it recommended them
to each other; for a wise man, that is to say a rogue, considers a
trick in life as a gamester doth a trick at play. It sets him on
his guard, but he admires the dexterity of him who plays it.
These, therefore, and many other such instances of ingenuity,
operated so violently on the count, that, notwithstanding the
disparity which age, title, and above all, dress, had set between
them, he resolved to enter into an acquaintance with Wild. This
soon produced a perfect intimacy, and that a friendship, which had
a longer duration than is common to that passion between persons
who only propose to themselves the common advantages of eating,
drinking, whoring, or borrowing money; which ends, as they soon
fail, so doth the friendship founded upon them. Mutual interest,
the greatest of all purposes, was the cement of this alliance,
which nothing, of consequence, but superior interest, was capable
of dissolving.




CHAPTER FIVE

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN YOUNG MASTER WILD AND COUNT LA RUSE, WHICH,
HAVING EXTENDED TO THE REJOINDER, HAD A VERY QUIET, EASY, AND
NATURAL CONCLUSION.


One evening, after the Miss Snaps were retired to rest, the count
thus addressed himself to young Wild: "You cannot, I apprehend,
Mr. Wild, be such a stranger to your own great capacity, as to be
surprised when I tell you I have often viewed, with a mixture of
astonishment and concern, your shining qualities confined to a
sphere where they can never reach the eyes of those who would
introduce them properly into the world, and raise you to an
eminence where you may blaze out to the admiration of all men. I
assure you I am pleased with my captivity, when I reflect I am
likely to owe to it an acquaintance, and I hope friendship, with
the greatest genius of my age; and, what is still more, when I
indulge my vanity with a prospect of drawing from obscurity
(pardon the expression) such talents as were, I believe, never
before like to have been buried in it: for I make no question but,
at my discharge from confinement, which will now soon happen, I
shall be able to introduce you into company, where you may reap
the advantage of your superior parts.

"I will bring you acquainted, sir, with those who, as they are
capable of setting a true value on such qualifications, so they
will have it both in their power and inclination to prefer you for
them. Such an introduction is the only advantage you want, without
which your merit might be your misfortune; for those abilities
which would entitle you to honour and profit in a superior station
may render you only obnoxious to danger and disgrace in a lower."

Mr. Wild answered, "Sir, I am not insensible of my obligations to
you, as well for the over-value you have set on my small
abilities, as for the kindness you express in offering to
introduce me among my superiors. I must own my father hath often
persuaded me to push myself into the company of my betters; but,
to say the truth, I have an aukward pride in my nature, which is
better pleased with being at the head of the lowest class than at
the bottom of the highest. Permit me to say, though the idea may
be somewhat coarse, I had rather stand on the summit of a dunghill
than at the bottom of a hill in Paradise. I have always thought it
signifies little into what rank of life I am thrown, provided I
make a great figure therein, and should be as well satisfied with
exerting my talents well at the head of a small party or gang, as
in the command of a mighty army; for I am far from agreeing with
you, that great parts are often lost in a low situation; on the
contrary, I am convinced it is impossible they should be lost. I
have often persuaded myself that there were not fewer than a
thousand in Alexander's troops capable of performing what
Alexander himself did.

"But, because such spirits were not elected or destined to an
imperial command, are we therefore to imagine they came off
without a booty? or that they contented themselves with the share
in common with their comrades? Surely, no. In civil life,
doubtless, the same genius, the same endowments, have often
composed the statesman and the prig, for so we call what the
vulgar name a thief. The same parts, the same actions, often
promote men to the head of superior societies, which raise them to
the head of lower; and where is the essential difference if the
one ends on Tower-hill and the other at Tyburn? Hath the block any
preference to the gallows, or the ax to the halter, but was given
them by the ill-guided judgment of men? You will pardon me,
therefore, if I am not so hastily inflamed with the common outside
of things, nor join the general opinion in preferring one state to
another. A guinea is as valuable in a leathern as in an
embroidered purse; and a cod's head is a cod's head still, whether
in a pewter or a silver dish."

The count replied as follows: "What you have now said doth not
lessen my idea of your capacity, but confirms my opinion of the
ill effect of bad and low company. Can any man doubt whether it is
better to be a great statesman or a common thief? I have often
heard that the devil used to say, where or to whom I know not,
that it was better to reign in Hell than to be a valet-de-chambre
in Heaven, and perhaps he was in the right; but sure, if he had
had the choice of reigning in either, he would have chosen better.
The truth therefore is, that by low conversation we contract a
greater awe for high things than they deserve. We decline great
pursuits not from contempt but despair. The man who prefers the
high road to a more reputable way of making his fortune doth it
because he imagines the one easier than the other; but you
yourself have asserted, and with undoubted truth, that the same
abilities qualify you for undertaking, and the same means will
bring you to your end in both journeys--as in music it is the same
tune, whether you play it in a higher or a lower key. To instance
in some particulars: is it not the same qualification which
enables this man to hire himself as a servant, and to get into the
confidence and secrets of his master in order to rob him, and that
to undertake trusts of the highest nature with a design to break
and betray them? Is it less difficult by false tokens to deceive a
shopkeeper into the delivery of his goods, which you afterwards
run away with, than to impose upon him by outward splendour and
the appearance of fortune into a credit by which you gain and he
loses twenty times as much? Doth it not require more dexterity in
the fingers to draw out a man's purse from his pocket, or to take
a lady's watch from her side, without being perceived of any (an
excellence in which, without flattery, I am persuaded you have no
superior), than to cog a die or to shuffle a pack of cards? Is not
as much art, as many excellent qualities, required to make a
pimping porter at a common bawdy-house as would enable a man to
prostitute his own or his friend's wife or child? Doth it not ask
as good a memory, as nimble an invention, as steady a countenance,
to forswear yourself in Westminster-hall as would furnish out a
complete tool of state, or perhaps a statesman himself? It is
needless to particularize every instance; in all we shall find
that there is a nearer connexion between high and low life than is
generally imagined, and that a highwayman is entitled to more
favour with the great than he usually meets with. If, therefore,
as I think I have proved, the same parts which qualify a man for
eminence in a low sphere, qualify him likewise for eminence in a
higher, sure it can be no doubt in which he would chuse to exert
them. Ambition, without which no one can be a great man, will
immediately instruct him, in your own phrase, to prefer a hill in
Paradise to a dunghill; nay, even fear, a passion the most
repugnant to greatness, will shew him how much more safely he may
indulge himself in the free and full exertion of his mighty
abilities in the higher than in the lower rank; since experience
teaches him that there is a crowd oftener in one year at Tyburn
than on Tower-hill in a century." Mr. Wild with much solemnity
rejoined, "That the same capacity which qualifies a mill-
ken,[Footnote: A housebreaker.] a bridle-cull,[Footnote: A
highwayman.] or a buttock-and-file, [Footnote: A shoplifter. Terms
used in the Cant Dictionary.] to arrive at any degree of eminence
in his profession, would likewise raise a man in what the world
esteem a more honourable calling, I do not deny; nay, in many of
your instances it is evident that more ingenuity, more art, are
necessary to the lower than the higher proficients. If, therefore,
you had only contended that every prig might be a statesman if he
pleased, I had readily agreed to it; but when you conclude that it
is his interest to be so, that ambition would bid him take that
alternative, in a word, that a statesman is greater or happier
than a prig, I must deny my assent. But, in comparing these two
together, we must carefully avoid being misled by the vulgar
erroneous estimation of things, for mankind err in disquisitions
of this nature as physicians do who in considering the operations
of a disease have not a due regard to the age and complexion of
the patient. The same degree of heat which is common in this
constitution may be a fever in that; in the same manner that which
may be riches or honour to me may be poverty or disgrace to
another: for all these things are to be estimated by relation to
the person who possesses them. A booty of L10 looks as great in
the eye of a bridle-cull, and gives as much real happiness to his
fancy, as that of as many thousands to the statesman; and doth not
the former lay out his acquisitions in whores and fiddles with
much greater joy and mirth than the latter in palaces and
pictures? What are the flattery, the false compliments of his gang
to the statesman, when he himself must condemn his own blunders,
and is obliged against his will to give fortune the whole honour
of success? What is the pride resulting from such sham applause,
compared to the secret satisfaction which a prig enjoys in his
mind in reflecting on a well-contrived and well-executed scheme?
Perhaps, indeed, the greater danger is on the prig's side; but
then you must remember that the greater honour is so too. When I
mention honour, I mean that which is paid them by their gang; for
that weak part of the world which is vulgarly called THE WISE see
both in a disadvantageous and disgraceful light; and as the prig
enjoys (and merits too) the greater degree of honour from his
gang, so doth he suffer the less disgrace from the world, who
think his misdeeds, as they call them, sufficiently at last
punished with a halter, which at once puts an end to his pain and
infamy; whereas the other is not only hated in power, but detested
and contemned at the scaffold; and future ages vent their malice
on his fame, while the other sleeps quiet and forgotten. Besides,
let us a little consider the secret quiet of their consciences:
how easy is the reflection of having taken a few shillings or
pounds from a stranger, without any breach of confidence, or
perhaps any great harm to the person who loses it, compared to
that of having betrayed a public trust, and ruined the fortunes of
thousands, perhaps of a great nation! How much braver is an attack
on the highway than at a gaming-table; and how much more innocent
the character of a b--dy-house than a c--t pimp!" He was eagerly
proceeding, when, casting his eyes on the count, he perceived him
to be fast asleep; wherefore, having first picked his pocket of
three shillings, then gently jogged him in order to take his
leave, and promised to return to him the next morning to
breakfast, they separated: the count retired to rest, and master
Wild to a night-cellar.




CHAPTER SIX

FURTHER CONFERENCES BETWEEN THE COUNT AND MASTER WILD, WITH OTHER
MATTERS OF THE GREAT KIND.


The count missed his money the next morning, and very well knew
who had it; but, as he knew likewise how fruitless would be any
complaint, he chose to pass it by without mentioning it. Indeed it
may appear strange to some readers that these gentlemen, who knew
each other to be thieves, should never once give the least hint of
this knowledge in all their discourse together, but, on the
contrary, should have the words honesty, honour, and friendship as
often in their mouths as any other men. This, I say, may appear
strange to some; but those who have lived long in cities, courts,
gaols, or such places, will perhaps be able to solve the seeming
absurdity.

When our two friends met the next morning the count (who, though
he did not agree with the whole of his friend's doctrine, was,
however, highly pleased with his argument) began to bewail the
misfortune of his captivity, and the backwardness of friends to
assist each other in their necessities; but what vexed him, he
said, most, was the cruelty of the fair: for he intrusted Wild
with the secret of his having had an intrigue with Miss Theodosia,
the elder of the Miss Snaps, ever since his confinement, though he
could not prevail with her to set him at liberty. Wild answered,
with a smile, "It was no wonder a woman should wish to confine her
lover where she might be sure of having him entirely to herself;"
but added, he believed he could tell him a method of certainly
procuring his escape. The count eagerly besought him to acquaint
him with it. Wild told him bribery was the surest means, and
advised him to apply to the maid. The count thanked him, but
returned, "That he had not a farthing left besides one guinea,
which he had then given her to change." To which Wild said, "He
must make it up with promises, which he supposed he was courtier
enough to know how to put off." The count greatly applauded the
advice, and said he hoped he should be able in time to persuade
him to condescend to be a great man, for which he was so perfectly
well qualified.

This method being concluded on, the two friends sat down to cards,
a circumstance which I should not have mentioned but for the sake
of observing the prodigious force of habit; for though the count
knew if he won ever so much of Mr. Wild he should not receive a
shilling, yet could he not refrain from packing the cards; nor
could Wild keep his hands out of his friend's pockets, though he
knew there was nothing in them.

When the maid came home the count began to put it to her; offered
her all he had, and promised mountains in futuro; but all in vain--
the maid's honesty was impregnable. She said, "She would not
break her trust for the whole world; no, not if she could gain a
hundred pound by it." Upon which Wild stepping up and telling her
"She need not fear losing her place, for it would never be found
out; that they could throw a pair of sheets into the street, by
which it might appear he got out at a window; that he himself
would swear he saw him descending; that the money would be so much
gains in her pocket; that, besides his promises, which she might
depend on being performed, she would receive from him twenty
shillings and ninepence in ready money (for she had only laid out
threepence in plain Spanish); and lastly, that, besides his
honour, the count should leave a pair of gold buttons (which
afterwards turned out to be brass) of great value, in her hands,
as a further pawn."

The maid still remained inflexible, till Wild offered to lend his
friend a guinea more, and to deposit it immediately in her hands.
This reinforcement bore down the poor girl's resolution, and she
faithfully promised to open the door to the count that evening.

Thus did our young hero not only lend his rhetoric, which few
people care to do without a fee, but his money too (a sum which
many a good man would have made fifty excuses before he would have
parted with), to his friend, and procured him his liberty.

But it would be highly derogatory from the GREAT character of
Wild, should the reader imagine he lent such a sum to a friend
without the least view of serving himself. As, therefore, the
reader may easily account for it in a manner more advantageous to
our hero's reputation, by concluding that he had some interested
view in the count's enlargement, we hope he will judge with
charity, especially as the sequel makes it not only reasonable but
necessary to suppose he had some such view.

A long intimacy and friendship subsisted between the count and Mr.
Wild, who, being by the advice of the count dressed in good
cloaths, was by him introduced into the best company. They
constantly frequented the assemblies, auctions, gaming-tables, and
play-houses; at which last they saw two acts every night, and then
retired without paying--this being, it seems, an immemorial
privilege which the beaus of the town prescribe for themselves.
This, however, did not suit Wild's temper, who called it a cheat,
and objected against it as requiring no dexterity, but what every
blockhead might put in execution. He said it was a custom very
much savouring of the sneaking-budge, [Footnote: Shoplifting] but
neither so honourable nor so ingenious.

Wild now made a considerable figure, and passed for a gentleman of
great fortune in the funds. Women of quality treated him with
great familiarity, young ladies began to spread their charms for
him, when an accident happened that put a stop to his continuance
in a way of life too insipid and inactive to afford employment for
those great talents which were designed to make a much more
considerable figure in the world than attends the character of a
beau or a pretty gentleman.




CHAPTER SEVEN

MASTER WILD SETS OUT ON HIS TRAVELS, AND RETURNS HOME AGAIN. A
VERY SHORT CHAPTER, CONTAINING INFINITELY MORE TIME AND LESS
MATTER THAN ANY OTHER IN THE WHOLE STORY.


We are sorry we cannot indulge our reader's curiosity with a full
and perfect account of this accident; but as there are such
various accounts, one of which only can be true, and possibly and
indeed probably none; instead of following the general method of
historians, who in such cases set down the various reports, and
leave to your own conjecture which you will chuse, we shall pass
them all over.

Certain it is that, whatever this accident was, it determined our
hero's father to send his son immediately abroad for seven years;
and, which may seem somewhat remarkable, to his majesty's
plantations in America--that part of the world being, as he said,
freer from vices than the courts and cities of Europe, and
consequently less dangerous to corrupt a young man's morals. And
as for the advantages, the old gentleman thought they were equal
there with those attained in the politer climates; for travelling,
he said, was travelling in one part of the world as well as
another; it consisted in being such a time from home, and in
traversing so many leagues; and [he] appealed to experience
whether most of our travellers in France and Italy did not prove
at their return that they might have been sent as profitably to
Norway and Greenland.

According to these resolutions of his father, the young gentleman
went aboard a ship, and with a great deal of good company set out
for the American hemisphere. The exact time of his stay is
somewhat uncertain; most probably longer than was intended. But
howsoever long his abode there was, it must be a blank in this
history, as the whole story contains not one adventure worthy the
reader's notice; being indeed a continued scene of whoring,
drinking, and removing from one place to another.

To confess a truth, we are so ashamed of the shortness of this
chapter, that we would have done a violence to our history, and
have inserted an adventure or two of some other traveller; to
which purpose we borrowed the journals of several young gentlemen
who have lately made the tour of Europe; but to our great sorrow,
could not extract a single incident strong enough to justify the
theft to our conscience.

When we consider the ridiculous figure this chapter must make,
being the history of no less than eight years, our only comfort
is, that the histories of some men's lives, and perhaps of some
men who have made a noise in the world, are in reality as absolute
blanks as the travels of our hero. As, therefore, we shall make
sufficient amends in the sequel for this inanity, we shall hasten
on to matters of true importance and immense greatness. At present
we content ourselves with setting down our hero where we took him
up, after acquainting our reader that he went abroad, staid seven
years, and then came home again.




CHAPTER EIGHT

AN ADVENTURE WHERE WILD, IN THE DIVISION OF THE BOOTY, EXHIBITS AN
ASTONISHING INSTANCE OF GREATNESS.


The count was one night very successful at the hazard-table, where
Wild, who was just returned from his travels, was then present; as
was likewise a young gentleman whose name was Bob Bagshot, an
acquaintance of Mr. Wild's, and of whom he entertained a great
opinion; taking, therefore, Mr. Bagshot aside, he advised him to
provide himself (if he had them not about him) with a case of
pistols, and to attack the count in his way home, promising to
plant himself near with the same arms, as a corps de reserve, and
to come up on occasion. This was accordingly executed, and the
count obliged to surrender to savage force what he had in so
genteel and civil a manner taken at play.

And as it is a wise and philosophical observation, that one
misfortune never comes alone, the count had hardly passed the
examination of Mr. Bagshot when he fell into the hands of Mr.
Snap, who, in company with Mr. Wild the elder and one or two more
gentlemen, being, it seems, thereto well warranted, laid hold of
the unfortunate count, and conveyed him back to the same house
from which, by the assistance of his good friend, he had formerly
escaped.

Mr. Wild and Mr. Bagshot went together to the tavern, where Mr.
Bagshot (generously, as he thought) offered to share the booty,
and, having divided the money into two unequal heaps, and added a
golden snuff-box to the lesser heap, he desired Mr. Wild to take
his choice.

Mr. Wild immediately conveyed the larger share of the ready into
his pocket, according to an excellent maxim of his, "First secure
what share you can before you wrangle for the rest;" and then,
turning to his companion, he asked with a stern countenance
whether he intended to keep all that sum to himself? Mr. Bagshot
answered, with some surprize, that he thought Mr. Wild had no
reason to complain; for it was surely fair, at least on his part,
to content himself with an equal share of the booty, who had taken
the whole. "I grant you took it," replied Wild; "but, pray, who
proposed or counselled the taking it? Can you say that you have
done more than executed my scheme? and might not I, if I had
pleased, have employed another, since you well know there was not
a gentleman in the room but would have taken the money if he had
known how, conveniently and safely, to do it?" "That is very
true," returned Bagshot, "but did not I execute the scheme, did
not I run the whole risque? Should not I have suffered the whole
punishment if I had been taken, and is not the labourer worthy of
his hire?" "Doubtless," says Jonathan, "he is so, and your hire I
shall not refuse you, which is all that the labourer is entitled
to or ever enjoys. I remember when I was at school to have heard
some verses which for the excellence of their doctrine made an
impression on me, purporting that the birds of the air and the
beasts of the field work not for themselves. It is true, the
farmer allows fodder to his oxen and pasture to his sheep; but it
is for his own service, not theirs, In the same manner the
ploughman, the shepherd, the weaver, the builder, and the soldier,
work not for themselves but others; they are contented with a poor
pittance (the labourer's hire), and permit us, the GREAT, to enjoy
the fruits of their labours. Aristotle, as my master told us, hath
plainly proved, in the first book of his politics, that the low,
mean, useful part of mankind, are born slaves to the wills of
their superiors, and are indeed as much their property as the
cattle. It is well said of us, the higher order of mortals, that
we are born only to devour the fruits of the earth; and it may be
as well said of the lower class, that they are born only to
produce them for us. Is not the battle gained by the sweat and
danger of the common soldier? Are not the honour and fruits of the
victory the general's who laid the scheme? Is not the house built
by the labour of the carpenter and the bricklayer? Is it not built
for the profit only of the architect and for the use of the
inhabitant, who could not easily have placed one brick upon
another? Is not the cloth or the silk wrought into its form and
variegated with all the beauty of colours by those who are forced
to content themselves with the coarsest and vilest part of their
work, while the profit and enjoyment of their labours fall to the
share of others? Cast your eye abroad, and see who is it lives in
the most magnificent buildings, feasts his palate with the most
luxurious dainties, his eyes with the most beautiful sculptures
and delicate paintings, and clothes himself in the finest and
richest apparel; and tell me if all these do not fall to his lot
who had not any the least share in producing all these
conveniences, nor the least ability so to do? Why then should the
state of a prig[Footnote: A thief.] differ from all others? Or why
should you, who are the labourer only, the executor of my scheme,
expect a share in the profit? Be advised, therefore; deliver the
whole booty to me, and trust to my bounty for your reward." MI have ruined
no more, than to regret the little I have done." He at length,
therefore, bravely resolved to consign over Heartfree to his fate,
though it cost him more struggling than may easily be believed,
utterly to conquer his reluctance, and to banish away every degree
of humanity from his mind, these little sparks of which composed
one of those weaknesses which we lamented in the opening of our
history.

But, in vindication of our hero, we must beg leave to observe that
Nature is seldom so kind as those writers who draw characters
absolutely perfect. She seldom creates any man so completely
great, or completely low, but that some sparks of humanity will
glimmer in the former, and some sparks of what the vulgar call
evil will dart forth in the latter: utterly to extinguish which
will give some pain, and uneasiness to both; for I apprehend no
mind was ever yet formed entirely free from blemish, unless
peradventure that of a sanctified hypocrite, whose praises some
well-fed flatterer hath gratefully thought proper to sing forth.




CHAPTER FIVE

CONTAINING VARIOUS MATTERS.


The day was now come when poor Heartfree was to suffer an
ignominious death. Friendly had in the strongest manner confirmed
his assurance of fulfilling his promise of becoming a father to
one of his children and a husband to the other. This gave him
inexpressible comfort, and he had, the evening before, taken his
last leave of the little wretches with a tenderness which drew a
tear from one of the keepers, joined to a magnanimity which would
have pleased a stoic. When he was informed that the coach which
Friendly had provided for him was ready, and that the rest of the
prisoners were gone, he embraced that faithful friend with great
passion, and begged that he would leave him here; but the other
desired leave to accompany him to his end, which at last he was
forced to comply with. And now he was proceeding towards the coach
when he found his difficulties were not yet over; for now a friend
arrived of whom he was to take a harder and more tender leave than
he had yet gone through. This friend, reader, was no other than
Mrs. Heartfree herself, who ran to him with a look all wild,
staring, and frantic, and having reached his arms, fainted away in
them without uttering a single syllable. Heartfree was, with great
difficulty, able to preserve his own senses in such a surprize at
such a season. And indeed our good-natured reader will be rather
inclined to wish this miserable couple had, by dying in each
other's arms, put a final period to their woes, than have survived
to taste those bitter moments which were to be their portion, and
which the unhappy wife, soon recovering from the short
intermission of being, now began to suffer. When she became first
mistress of her voice she burst forth into the following accents:--
"O my husband! Is this the condition in which I find you after
our cruel separation? Who hath done this? Cruel Heaven! What is
the occasion? I know thou canst deserve no ill. Tell me, somebody
who can speak, while I have my senses left to understand, what is
the matter?" At which words several laughed, and one answered,
"The matter! Why no great matter. The gentleman is not the first,
nor won't be the last: the worst of the matter is, that if we are
to stay all the morning here I shall lose my dinner." Heartfree,
pausing a moment and recollecting himself, cryed out, "I will bear
all with patience." And then, addressing himself to the commanding
officer, begged he might only have a few minutes by himself with
his wife, whom he had not seen before since his misfortunes. The
great man answered, "He had compassion on him, and would do more
than he could answer; but he supposed he was too much a gentleman
not to know that something was due for such civility." On this
hint, Friendly, who was himself half dead, pulled five guineas out
of his pocket, which the great man took, and said he would be so
generous to give him ten minutes; on which one observed that many
a gentleman had bought ten minutes with a woman dearer, and many
other facetious remarks were made, unnecessary to be here related.
Heartfree was now suffered to retire into a room with his wife,
the commander informing him at his entrance that he must be
expeditious, for that the rest of the good company would be at the
tree before him, and he supposed he was a gentleman of too much
breeding to make them wait.

This tender wretched couple were now retired for these few
minutes, which the commander without carefully measured with his
watch; and Heartfree was mustering all his resolution to part with
what his soul so ardently doated on, and to conjure her to support
his loss for the sake of her poor infants, and to comfort her with
the promise of Friendly on their account; but all his design was
frustrated. Mrs. Heartfree could not support the shock, but again
fainted away, and so entirely lost every symptom of life that
Heartfree called vehemently for assistance. Friendly rushed first
into the room, and was soon followed by many others, and, what was
remarkable, one who had unmoved beheld the tender scene between
these parting lovers was touched to the quick by the pale looks of
the woman, and ran up and down for water, drops, &c., with the
utmost hurry and confusion. The ten minutes were expired, which
the commander now hinted; and seeing nothing offered for the
renewal of the term (for indeed Friendly had unhappily emptied his
pockets), he began to grow very importunate, and at last told
Heartfree he should be ashamed not to act more like a man.
Heartfree begged his pardon, and said he would make him wait no
longer. Then, with the deepest sigh, cryed, "Oh, my angel!" and,
embracing his wife with the utmost eagerness, kissed her pale lips
with more fervency than ever bridegroom did the blushing cheeks of
his bride. He then cryed, "The Almighty bless thee! and, if it be
his pleasure, restore thee to life; if not, I beseech him we may
presently meet again in a better world than this." He was breaking
from her, when, perceiving her sense returning, he could not
forbear renewing his embrace, and again pressing her lips, which
now recovered life and warmth so fast that he begged one ten
minutes more to tell her what her swooning had prevented her
hearing. The worthy commander, being perhaps a little touched at
this tender scene, took Friendly aside, and asked him what he
would give if he would suffer his friend to remain half-an-hour?
Friendly answered, anything; that he had no more money in his
pocket, but he would certainly pay him that afternoon. "Well,
then, I'll be moderate," said he; "twenty guineas." Friendly
answered, "It is a bargain." The commander, having exacted a firm
promise, cryed, "Then I don't care if they stay a whole hour
together; for what signifies hiding good news? the gentleman is
reprieved;" of which he had just before received notice in a
whisper. It would be very impertinent to offer at a description of
the joy this occasioned to the two friends, or to Mrs. Heartfree,
who was now again recovered. A surgeon, who was happily present,
was employed to bleed them all. After which the commander, who had
his promise of the money again confirmed to him, wished Heartfree
joy, and, shaking him very friendly by the hands, cleared the room
of all the company, and left the three friends together.




CHAPTER SIX

IN WHICH THE FOREGOING HAPPY INCIDENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR.


But here, though I am convinced my good-natured reader may almost
want the surgeon's assistance also, and that there is no passage
in this whole story which can afford him equal delight, yet, lest
our reprieve should seem to resemble that in the Beggars' Opera, I
shall endeavour to shew him that this incident, which is
undoubtedly true, is at least as natural as delightful; for we
assure him we would rather have suffered half mankind to be
hanged, than have saved one contrary to the strictest rules of
writing and probability.

Be it known, then (a circumstance which I think highly credible),
that the great Fireblood had been, a few days before, taken in the
fact of a robbery, and carried before the same justice of peace
who had, on his evidence, committed Heartfree to prison. This
magistrate, who did indeed no small honour to the commission he
bore, duly considered the weighty charge committed to him, by
which he was entrusted with decisions affecting the lives,
liberties, and properties of his countrymen. He therefore examined
always with the utmost diligence and caution into every minute
circumstance. And, as he had a good deal balanced, even when he
committed Heartfree, on the excellent character given him by
Friendly and the maid; and as he was much staggered on finding
that, of the two persons on whose evidence alone Heartfree had
been committed, and had been since convicted, one was in Newgate
for a felony, and the other was now brought before him for a
robbery, he thought proper to put the matter very home to
Fireblood at this time. The young Achates was taken, as we have
said, in the fact; so that denial he saw was in vain. He therefore
honestly confessed what he knew must be proved; and desired, on
the merit of the discoveries he made, to be admitted as an
evidence against his accomplices. This afforded the happiest
opportunity to the justice to satisfy his conscience in relation
to Heartfree. He told Fireblood that, if he expected the favour he
solicited, it must be on condition that he revealed the whole
truth to him concerning the evidence which he had lately given
against a bankrupt, and which some circumstances had induced a
suspicion of; that he might depend on it the truth would be
discovered by other means, and gave some oblique hints (a deceit
entirely justifiable) that Wild himself had offered such a
discovery. The very mention of Wild's name immediately alarmed
Fireblood, who did not in the least doubt the readiness of that
GREAT MAN to hang any of the gang when his own interest seemed to
require it. He therefore hesitated not a moment; but, having
obtained a promise from the justice that he should be accepted as
an evidence, he discovered the whole falsehood, and declared that
he had been seduced by Wild to depose as he had done.

The justice, having thus luckily and timely discovered this scene
of villany, alias greatness, lost not a moment in using his utmost
endeavours to get the case of the unhappy convict represented to
the sovereign, who immediately granted him that gracious reprieve
which caused such happiness to the persons concerned; and which we
hope we have now accounted for to the satisfaction of the reader.

The good magistrate, having obtained this reprieve for Heartfree,
thought it incumbent on him to visit him in the prison, and to
sound, if possible, the depth of this affair, that, if he should
appear as innocent as he now began to conceive him, he might use
all imaginable methods to obtain his pardon and enlargement.

The next day therefore after that when the miserable scene above
described had passed, he went to Newgate, where he found those
three persons, namely, Heartfree, his wife, and Friendly, sitting
together. The justice informed the prisoner of the confession of
Fireblood, with the steps which he had taken upon it. The reader
will easily conceive the many outward thanks, as well as inward
gratitude, which he received from all three; but those were of
very little consequence to him compared with the secret
satisfaction he felt in his mind from reflecting on the
preservation of innocence, as he soon after very clearly perceived
was the case.

When he entered the room Mrs. Heartfree was speaking with some
earnestness: as he perceived, therefore, he had interrupted her,
he begged she would continue her discourse, which, if he prevented
by his presence, he desired to depart; but Heartfree would not
suffer it. He said she had been relating some adventures which
perhaps, might entertain him to hear, and which she the rather
desired he would hear, as they might serve to illustrate the
foundation on which this falsehood had been built, which had
brought on her husband all his misfortunes.

The justice very gladly consented, and Mrs. Heartfree, at her
husband's desire, began the relation from the first renewal of
Wild's acquaintance with him; but, though this recapitulation was
necessary for the information of our good magistrate, as it would
be useless, and perhaps tedious, to the reader, we shall only
repeat that part of her story to which he is only a stranger,
beginning with what happened to her after Wild had been turned
adrift in the boat by the captain of the French privateer.




CHAPTER SEVEN

MRS. HEARTFREE RELATES HER ADVENTURES.


Mrs. Heartfree proceeded thus: "The vengeance which the French
captain exacted on that villain (our hero) persuaded me that I was
fallen into the hands of a man of honour and justice; nor indeed
was it possible for any person to be treated with more respect and
civility than I now was; but if this could not mitigate my sorrows
when I reflected on the condition in which I had been betrayed to
leave all that was dear to me, much less could it produce such an
effect when I discovered, as I soon did, that I owed it chiefly to
a passion which threatened me with great uneasiness, as it quickly
appeared to be very violent, and as I was absolutely in the power
of the person who possessed it, or was rather possessed by it. I
must however do him the justice to say my fears carried my
suspicions farther than I afterwards found I had any reason to
carry them: he did indeed very soon acquaint me with his passion,
and used all those gentle methods which frequently succeed with
our sex to prevail with me to gratify it; but never once
threatened, nor had the least recourse to force. He did not even
once insinuate to me that I was totally in his power, which I
myself sufficiently saw, and whence I drew the most dreadful
apprehensions, well knowing that, as there are some dispositions
so brutal that cruelty adds a zest and savour to their pleasures,
so there are others whose gentler inclinations are better
gratified when they win us by softer methods to comply with their
desires; yet that even these may be often compelled by an unruly
passion to have recourse at last to the means of violence, when
they despair of success from persuasion; but I was happily the
captive of a better man. My conqueror was one of those over whom
vice hath a limited jurisdiction; and, though he was too easily
prevailed on to sin, he was proof against any temptation to
villany.

"We had been two days almost totally becalmed, when, a brisk gale
rising as we were in sight in Dunkirk, we saw a vessel making full
sail towards us. The captain of the privateer was so strong that
he apprehended no danger but from a man-of-war, which the sailors
discerned this not to be. He therefore struck his colours, and
furled his sails as much as possible, in order to lie by and
expect her, hoping she might be a prize." (Here Heartfree smiling,
his wife stopped and inquired the cause. He told her it was from
her using the sea-terms so aptly: she laughed, and answered he
would wonder less at this when he heard the long time she had been
on board; and then proceeded.) "This vessel now came alongside of
us, and hailed us, having perceived that on which we were aboard
to be of her own country; they begged us not to put into Dunkirk,
but to accompany them in their pursuit of a large English
merchantman, whom we should easily overtake, and both together as
easily conquer. Our captain immediately consented to this
proposition, and ordered all his sail to be crowded. This was most
unwelcome news to me; however, he comforted me all he could by
assuring me I had nothing to fear, that he would be so far from
offering the least rudeness to me himself, that he would, at the
hazard of his life, protect me from it. This assurance gave me all
the consolation which my present circumstances and the dreadful
apprehensions I had on your dear account would admit." (At which
words the tenderest glances passed on both sides between the
husband and wife.)

"We sailed near twelve hours, when we came in sight of the ship we
were in pursuit of, and which we should probably have soon come up
with had not a very thick mist ravished her from our eyes. This
mist continued several hours, and when it cleared up we discovered
our companion at a great distance from us; but what gave us (I
mean the captain and his crew) the greatest uneasiness was the
sight of a very large ship within a mile of us, which presently
saluted us with a gun, and now appeared to be a third-rate English
man-of-war. Our captain declared the impossibility of either
fighting or escaping, and accordingly struck without waiting for
the broadside which was preparing for us, and which perhaps would
have prevented me from the happiness I now enjoy." This occasioned
Heartfree to change colour; his wife therefore passed hastily to
circumstances of a more smiling complexion.

"I greatly rejoiced at this event, as I thought it would not only
restore me to the safe possession of my jewels, but to what I
value beyond all the treasure in the universe. My expectation,
however, of both these was somewhat crost for the present: as to
the former, I was told they should be carefully preserved; but
that I must prove my right to them before I could expect their
restoration, which, if I mistake not, the captain did not very
eagerly desire I should be able to accomplish: and as to the
latter, I was acquainted that I should be put on board the first
ship which they met on her way to England, but that they were
proceeding to the West Indies.

"I had not been long on board the man-of-war before I discovered
just reason rather to lament than rejoice at the exchange of my
captivity; for such I concluded my present situation to be. I had
now another lover in the captain of this Englishman, and much
rougher and less gallant than the Frenchman had been. He used me
with scarce common civility, as indeed he shewed very little to
any other person, treating his officers little better than a man
of no great good-breeding would exert to his meanest servant, and
that too on some very irritating provocation. As for me, he
addressed me with the insolence of a basha to a Circassian slave;
he talked to me with the loose licence in which the most
profligate libertines converse with harlots, and which women
abandoned only in a moderate degree detest and abhor. He often
kissed me with very rude familiarity, and one day attempted
further brutality; when a gentleman on board, and who was in my
situation, that is, had been taken by a privateer and was retaken,
rescued me from his hands, for which the captain confined him,
though he was not under his command, two days in irons: when he
was released (for I was not suffered to visit him in his
confinement) I went to him and thanked him with the utmost
acknowledgment for what he had done and suffered on my account.
The gentleman behaved to me in the handsomest manner on this
occasion; told me he was ashamed of the high sense I seemed to
entertain of so small an obligation of an action to which his duty
as a Christian and his honour as a man obliged him. From this time
I lived in great familiarity with this man, whom I regarded as my
protector, which he professed himself ready to be on all
occasions, expressing the utmost abhorrence of the captain's
brutality, especially that shewn towards me, and the tenderness of
a parent for the preservation of my virtue, for which I was not
myself more solicitous than he appeared. He was, indeed, the only
man I had hitherto met since my unhappy departure who did not
endeavour by all his looks, words, and actions, to assure me he
had a liking to my unfortunate person; the rest seeming desirous
of sacrificing the little beauty they complimented to their
desires, without the least consideration of the ruin which I
earnestly represented to them they were attempting to bring on me
and on my future repose.

"I now passed several days pretty free from the captain's
molestation, till one fatal night." Here, perceiving Heartfree
grew pale, she comforted him by an assurance that Heaven had
preserved her chastity, and again had restored her unsullied to
his arms. She continued thus: "Perhaps I give it a wrong epithet
in the word fatal; but a wretched night I am sure I may call it,
for no woman who came off victorious was, I believe, ever in
greater danger. One night I say, having drank his spirits high
with punch, in company with the purser, who was the only man in
the ship he admitted to his table, the captain sent for me into
his cabin; whither, though unwilling, I was obliged to go. We were
no sooner alone together than he seized me by the hand, and, after
affronting my ears with discourse which I am unable to repeat, he
swore a great oath that his passion was to be dallied with no
longer; that I must not expect to treat him in the manner to which
a set of blockhead land-men submitted. 'None of your coquette
airs, therefore, with me, madam,' said he, 'for I am resolved to
have you this night. No struggling nor squalling, for both will be
impertinent. The first man who offers to come in here, I will have
his skin flea'd off at the gangway.' He then attempted to pull me
violently towards his bed. I threw myself on my knees, and with
tears and entreaties besought his compassion; but this was, I
found, to no purpose: I then had recourse to threats, and
endeavoured to frighten him with the consequence; but neither had
this, though it seemed to stagger him more than the other method,
sufficient force to deliver me. At last a stratagem came into my
head, of which my perceiving him reel gave me the first hint. I
entreated a moment's reprieve only, when, collecting all the
spirits I could muster, I put on a constrained air of gayety, and
told him, with an affected laugh, he was the roughest lover I had
ever met with, and that I believed I was the first woman he had
ever paid his addresses to. Addresses, said he; d--n your dresses!
I want to undress you. I then begged him to let us drink some
punch together; for that I loved a can as well as himself, and
never would grant the favour to any man till I had drank a hearty
glass with him. O! said he, if that be all you shall have punch
enough to drown yourself in. At which words he rung the bell, and
ordered in a gallon of that liquor. I was in the meantime obliged
to suffer his nauseous kisses, and some rudenesses which I had
great difficulty to restrain within moderate bounds. When the
punch came in he took up the bowl and drank my health
ostentatiously, in such a quantity that it considerably advanced
my scheme. I followed him with bumpers as fast as possible, and
was myself obliged to drink so much that at another time it would
have staggered my own reason, but at present it did not affect me.
At length, perceiving him very far gone, I watched an opportunity,
and ran out of the cabin, resolving to seek protection of the sea
if I could find no other; but Heaven was now graciously pleased to
relieve me; for in his attempt to pursue me he reeled backwards,
and, falling down the cabbin stairs, he dislocated his shoulder
and so bruised himself that I was not only preserved that night
from any danger of my intended ravisher, but the accident threw
him into a fever which endangered his life, and whether he ever
recovered or no I am not certain; for during his delirious fits
the eldest lieutenant commanded the ship. This was a virtuous and
a brave fellow, who had been twenty-five years in that post
without being able to obtain a ship, and had seen several boys,
the bastards of noblemen, put over his head. One day while the
ship remained under his command an English vessel bound to Cork
passed by; myself and my friend, who had formerly lain two days in
irons on my account, went on board this ship with the leave of the
good lieutenant, who made us such presents as he was able of
provisions, and, congratulating me on my delivery from a danger to
which none of the ship's crew had been strangers, he kindly wished
us both a safe voyage."




CHAPTER EIGHT

IN WHICH MRS. HEARTFREE CONTINUES THE RELATION OF HER ADVENTURES.


The first evening after we were aboard this vessel, which was a
brigantine, we being then at no very great distance from the
Madeiras, the most violent storm arose from the northwest, in
which we presently lost both our masts; and indeed death now
presented itself as inevitable to us: I need not tell my Tommy
what were then my thoughts. Our danger was so great that the
captain of the ship, a professed atheist, betook himself to
prayers, and the whole crew, abandoning themselves for lost, fell
with the utmost eagerness to the emptying a cask of brandy, not
one drop of which they swore should be polluted with salt water. I
observed here my old friend displayed less courage than I expected
from him. He seemed entirely swallowed up in despair. But Heaven
be praised! we were all at last preserved. The storm, after above
eleven hours' continuance, began to abate, and by degrees entirely
ceased, but left us still rolling at the mercy of the waves, which
carried us at their own pleasure to the south-east a vast number
of leagues. Our crew were all dead drunk with the brandy which
they had taken such care to preserve from the sea; but, indeed,
had they been awake, their labour would have been of very little
service, as we had lost all our rigging, our brigantine being
reduced to a naked hulk only. In this condition we floated above
thirty hours, till in the midst of a very dark night we spied a
light, which seeming to approach us, grew so large that our
sailors concluded it to be the lantern of a man of war; but when
we were cheering ourselves with the hopes of our deliverance from
this wretched situation, on a sudden, to our great concern, the
light entirely disappeared, and left us in despair encreased by
the remembrance of those pleasing imaginations with which we had
entertained our minds during its appearance. The rest of the night
we passed in melancholy conjectures on the light which had
deserted us, which the major part of the sailors concluded to be a
meteor. In this distress we had one comfort, which was a plentiful
store of provisions; this so supported the spirits of the sailors,
that they declared had they but a sufficient quantity of brandy
they cared not whether they saw land for a month to come; but
indeed we were much nearer it than we imagined, as we perceived at
break of day. One of the most knowing of the crew declared we were
near the continent of Africa; but when we were within three
leagues of it a second violent storm arose from the north, so that
we again gave over all hopes of safety. This storm was not quite
so outrageous as the former, but of much longer continuance, for
it lasted near three days, and drove us an immense number of
leagues to the south. We were within a league of the shore,
expecting every moment our ship to be dashed in pieces, when the
tempest ceased all on a sudden; but the waves still continued to
roll like mountains, and before the sea recovered its calm motion,
our ship was thrown so near the land, that the captain ordered out
his boat, declaring he had scarce any hopes of saving her; and
indeed we had not quitted her many minutes before we saw the
justice of his apprehensions, for she struck against a rock and
immediately sunk. The behaviour of the sailors on this occasion
very much affected me; they beheld their ship perish with the
tenderness of a lover or a parent; they spoke of her as the
fondest husband would of his wife; and many of them, who seemed to
have no tears in their composition, shed them plentifully at her
sinking. The captain himself cried out, 'Go thy way, charming
Molly, the sea never devoured a lovelier morsel. If I have fifty
vessels I shall never love another like thee. Poor slut! I shall
remember thee to my dying day.' Well, the boat now conveyed us all
safe to shore, where we landed with very little difficulty. It was
now about noon, and the rays of the sun, which descended almost
perpendicular on our heads, were extremely hot and troublesome.
However, we travelled through this extreme heat about five miles
over a plain. This brought us to a vast wood, which extended
itself as far as we could see, both to the right and left, and
seemed to me to put an entire end to our progress. Here we decreed
to rest and dine on the provision which we had brought from the
ship, of which we had sufficient for very few meals; our boat
being so overloaded with people that we had very little room for
luggage of any kind. Our repast was salt pork broiled, which the
keenness of hunger made so delicious to my companions that they
fed very heartily upon it. As for myself, the fatigue of my body
and the vexation of my mind had so thoroughly weakened me, that I
was almost entirely deprived of appetite; and the utmost dexterity
of the most accomplished French cook would have been ineffectual
had he endeavoured to tempt me with delicacies. I thought myself
very little a gainer by my late escape from the tempest, by which
I seemed only to have exchanged the element in which I was
presently to die. When our company had sufficiently, and indeed
very plentifully feasted themselves, they resolved to enter the
wood and endeavour to pass it, in expectation of finding some
inhabitants, at least some provision. We proceeded therefore in
the following order: one man in the front with a hatchet, to clear
our way, and two others followed him with guns, to protect the
rest from wild beasts; then walked the rest of our company, and
last of all the captain himself, being armed likewise with a gun,
to defend us from any attack behind--in the rear, I think you call
it. And thus our whole company, being fourteen in number,
travelled on till night overtook us, without seeing anything
unless a few birds and some very insignificant animals. We rested
all night under the covert of some trees, and indeed we very
little wanted shelter at that season, the heat in the day being
the only inclemency we had to combat with in this climate. I
cannot help telling you my old friend lay still nearest me on the
ground, and declared he would be my protector should any of the
sailors offer rudeness; but I can acquit them of any such attempt;
nor was I ever affronted by any one, more than with a coarse
expression, proceeding rather from the roughness and ignorance of
their education than from any abandoned principle, or want of
humanity.

"We had now proceeded very little way on our next day's march when
one of the sailors, having skipt nimbly up a hill, with the
assistance of a speaking trumpet informed us that he saw a town a
very little way off. This news so comforted me, and gave me such
strength, as well as spirits, that, with the help of my old friend
and another, who suffered me to lean on them, I, with much
difficulty, attained the summit; but was so absolutely overcome in
climbing it, that I had no longer sufficient strength to support
my tottering limbs, and was obliged to lay myself again on the
ground; nor could they prevail on me to undertake descending
through a very thick wood into a plain, at the end of which indeed
appeared some houses, or rather huts, but at a much greater
distance than the sailor assured us; the little way, as he had
called it, seeming to me full twenty miles, nor was it, I believe,
much less."




CHAPTER NINE

CONTAINING INCIDENTS VERY SURPRIZING.


The captain declared he would, without delay, proceed to the town
before him; in which resolution he was seconded by all the crew;
but when I could not be persuaded, nor was I able to travel any
farther before I had rested myself, my old friend protested he
would not leave me, but would stay behind as my guard; and, when I
had refreshed myself with a little repose, he would attend me to
the town, which the captain promised he would not leave before he
had seen us.

"They were no sooner departed than (having first thanked my
protector for his care of me) I resigned myself to sleep, which
immediately closed my eyelids, and would probably have detained me
very long in his gentle dominions, had I not been awaked with a
squeeze by the hand by my guard, which I at first thought intended
to alarm me with the danger of some wild beast; but I soon
perceived it arose from a softer motive, and that a gentle swain
was the only wild beast I had to apprehend. He began now to
disclose his passion in the strongest manner imaginable, indeed
with a warmth rather beyond that of both my former lovers, but as
yet without any attempt of absolute force. On my side
remonstrances were made in more bitter exclamations and revilings
than I had used to any, that villain Wild excepted. I told him he
was the basest and most treacherous wretch alive; that his having
cloaked his iniquitous designs under the appearance of virtue and
friendship added an ineffable degree of horror to them; that I
detested him of all mankind the most, and could I be brought to
yield to prostitution, he should be the last to enjoy the ruins of
my honour. He suffered himself not to be provoked by this
language, but only changed his manner of solicitation from
flattery to bribery. He unript the lining of his waistcoat, and
pulled forth several jewels; these, he said, he had preserved from
infinite danger to the happiest purpose, if I could be won by
them. I rejected them often with the utmost indignation, till at
last, casting my eye, rather by accident than design, on a diamond
necklace, a thought, like lightning, shot through my mind, and, in
an instant, I remembered that this was the very necklace you had
sold the cursed count, the cause of all our misfortunes. The
confusion of ideas into which this surprize hurried me prevented
my reflecting on the villain who then stood before me; but the
first recollection presently told me it could be no other than the
count himself, the wicked tool of Wild's barbarity. Good heavens!
what was then my condition! How shall I describe the tumult of
passions which then laboured in my breast? However, as I was
happily unknown to him, the least suspicion on his side was
altogether impossible. He imputed, therefore, the eagerness with
which I gazed on the jewels to a very wrong cause, and endeavoured
to put as much additional softness into his countenance as he was
able. My fears were a little quieted, and I was resolved to be
very liberal of promises, and hoped so thoroughly to persuade him
of my venality that he might, without any doubt, be drawn in to
wait the captain and crew's return, who would, I was very certain,
not only preserve me from his violence, but secure the restoration
of what you had been so cruelly robbed of. But, alas! I was
mistaken." Mrs. Heartfree, again perceiving symptoms of the utmost
disquietude in her husband's countenance, cryed out, "My dear,
don't you apprehend any harm.--But, to deliver you as soon as
possible from your anxiety--when he perceived I declined the
warmth of his addresses he begged me to consider; he changed at
once his voice and features, and, in a very different tone from
what he had hitherto affected, he swore I should not deceive him
as I had the captain; that fortune had kindly thrown an
opportunity in his way which he was resolved not foolishly to
lose; and concluded with a violent oath that he was determined to
enjoy me that moment, and therefore I knew the consequence of
resistance. He then caught me in his arms, and began such rude
attempts, that I skreamed out with all the force I could, though I
had so little hopes of being rescued, when there suddenly rushed
forth from a thicket a creature which, at his first appearance,
and in the hurry of spirits I then was, I did not take for a man;
but, indeed, had he been the fiercest of wild beasts, I should
have rejoiced at his devouring us both. I scarce perceived he had
a musket in his hand before he struck my ravisher such a blow with
it that he felled him at my feet. He then advanced with a gentle
air towards me, and told me in French he was extremely glad he had
been luckily present to my assistance. He was naked, except his
middle and his feet, if I can call a body so which was covered
with hair almost equal to any beast whatever. Indeed, his
appearance was so horrid in my eyes, that the friendship he had
shewn me, as well as his courteous behaviour, could not entirely
remove the dread I had conceived from his figure. I believe he saw
this very visibly; for he begged me not to be frightened, since,
whatever accident had brought me thither, I should have reason to
thank heaven for meeting him, at whose hands I might assure myself
of the utmost civility and protection. In the midst of all this
consternation, I had spirits enough to take up the casket of
jewels which the villain, in falling, had dropped out of his
hands, and conveyed it into my pocket. My deliverer, telling me
that I seemed extremely weak and faint, desired me to refresh
myself at his little hut, which, he said, was hard by. If his
demeanour had been less kind and obliging, my desperate situation
must have lent me confidence; for sure the alternative could not
be doubtful, whether I should rather trust this man, who,
notwithstanding his savage outside, expressed so much devotion to
serve me, which at least I was not certain of the falsehood of, or
should abide with one whom I so perfectly well knew to be an
accomplished villain. I therefore committed myself to his
guidance, though with tears in my eyes, and begged him to have
compassion on my innocence, which was absolutely in his power. He
said, the treatment he had been witness of, which he supposed was
from one who had broken his trust towards me, sufficiently
justified my suspicion; but begged me to dry my eyes, and he would
soon convince me that I was with a man of different sentiments.
The kind accents which accompanied these words gave me some
comfort, which was assisted by the repossession of our jewels by
an accident so strongly savouring of the disposition of Providence
in my favour.

"We left the villain weltering in his blood, though beginning to
recover a little motion, and walked together to his hut, or rather
cave, for it was under ground, on the side of a hill; the
situation was very pleasant, and from its mouth we overlooked a
large plain and the town I had before seen. As soon as I entered
it, he desired me to sit down on a bench of earth, which served
him for chairs, and then laid before me some fruits, the wild
product of that country, one or two of which had an excellent
flavour. He likewise produced some baked flesh, a little
resembling that of venison. He then brought forth a bottle of
brandy, which he said had remained with him ever since his
settling there, now above thirty years, during all which time he
had never opened it, his only liquor being water; that he had
reserved this bottle as a cordial in sickness; but, he thanked
heaven, he had never yet had occasion for it. He then acquainted
me that he was a hermit, that he had been formerly cast away on
that coast, with his wife, whom he dearly loved, but could not
preserve from perishing; on which account he had resolved never to
return to France, which was his native country, but to devote
himself to prayer and a holy life, placing all his hopes in the
blessed expectation of meeting that dear woman again in heaven,
where, he was convinced, she was now a saint and an interceder for
him. He said he had exchanged a watch with the king of that
country, whom he described to be a very just and good man, for a
gun, some powder, shot, and ball, with which he sometimes provided
himself food, but more generally used it in defending himself
against wild beasts; so that his diet was chiefly of the vegetable
kind. He told me many more circumstances, which I may relate to
you hereafter: but, to be as concise as possible at present, he at
length greatly comforted me by promising to conduct me to a
seaport, where I might have an opportunity to meet with some
vessels trafficking for slaves; and whence I might once more
commit myself to that element which, though I had already suffered
so much on it, I must again trust to put me in possession of all I
loved.

"The character he gave me of the inhabitants of the town we saw
below us, and of their king, made me desirous of being conducted
thither; especially as I very much wished to see the captain and
sailors, who had behaved very kindly to me, and with whom,
notwithstanding all the civil behaviour of the hermit, I was
rather easier in my mind than alone with this single man; but he
dissuaded me greatly from attempting such a walk till I had
recruited my spirits with rest, desiring me to repose myself on
his couch or bank, saying that he himself would retire without the
cave, where he would remain as my guard. I accepted this kind
proposal, but it was long before I could procure any slumber;
however, at length, weariness prevailed over my fears, and I
enjoyed several hours' sleep. When I awaked I found my faithful
centinel on his post and ready at my summons. This behaviour
infused some confidence into me, and I now repeated my request
that he would go with me to the town below; but he answered, it
would be better advised to take some repast before I undertook the
journey, which I should find much longer than it appeared. I
consented, and he set forth a greater variety of fruits than
before, of which I ate very plentifully. My collation being ended,
I renewed the mention of my walk, but he still persisted in
dissuading me, telling me that I was not yet strong enough; that I
could repose myself nowhere with greater safety than in his cave;
and that, for his part, he could have no greater happiness than
that of attending me, adding, with a sigh, it was a happiness he
should envy any other more than all the gifts of fortune. You may
imagine I began now to entertain suspicions; but he presently
removed all doubt by throwing himself at my feet and expressing
the warmest passion for me. I should have now sunk with despair
had he not accompanied these professions with the most vehement
protestations that he would never offer me any other force but
that of entreaty, and that he would rather die the most cruel
death by my coldness than gain the highest bliss by becoming the
occasion of a tear of sorrow to these bright eyes, which he said
were stars, under whose benign influence alone he could enjoy, or
indeed suffer life." She was repeating many more compliments he
made her, when a horrid uproar, which alarmed the whole gate, put
a stop to her narration at present. It is impossible for me to
give the reader a better idea of the noise which now arose than by
desiring him to imagine I had the hundred tongues the poet once
wished for, and was vociferating from them all at once, by
hollowing, scolding, crying, swearing, bellowing, and, in short,
by every different articulation which is within the scope of the
human organ.




CHAPTER TEN

A HORRIBLE UPROAR IN THE GATE.


But however great an idea the reader may hence conceive of this
uproar, he will think the occasion more than adequate to it when
he is informed that our hero (I blush to name it) had discovered
an injury done to his honour, and that in the tenderest point. In
a word, reader (for thou must know it, though it give thee the
greatest horror imaginable), he had caught Fireblood in the arms
of his lovely Laetitia.

As the generous bull who, having long depastured among a number of
cows, and thence contracted an opinion that these cows are all his
own property, if he beholds another bull bestride a cow within his
walks, he roars aloud, and threatens instant vengeance with his
horns, till the whole parish are alarmed with his bellowing; not
with less noise nor less dreadful menaces did the fury of Wild
burst forth and terrify the whole gate. Long time did rage render
his voice inarticulate to the hearer; as when, at a visiting day,
fifteen or sixteen or perhaps twice as many females, of delicate
but shrill pipes, ejaculate all at once on different subjects, all
is sound only, the harmony entirely melodious indeed, but conveys
no idea to our ears; but at length, when reason began to get the
better of his passion, which latter, being deserted by his breath,
began a little to retreat, the following accents, leapt over the
hedge of his teeth, or rather the ditch of his gums, whence those
hedgestakes had long since by a batten been displaced in battle
with an amazon of Drury.

[Footnote: The beginning of this speech is lost.]--"Man of honour!
doth this become a friend? Could I have expected such a breach of
all the laws of honour from thee, whom I had taught to walk in its
paths? Hadst thou chosen any other way to injure my confidence I
could have forgiven it; but this is a stab in the tenderest part,
a wound never to be healed, an injury never to be repaired; for it
is not only the loss of an agreeable companion, of the affection
of a wife dearer to my soul than life itself, it is not this loss
alone I lament; this loss is accompanied with disgrace and with
dishonour. The blood of the Wilds, which hath run with such
uninterrupted purity through so many generations, this blood is
fouled, is contaminated: hence flow my tears, hence arises my
grief. This is the injury never to be redressed, nor even to be
with honour forgiven." "M---in a bandbox!" answered Fireblood;
"here is a noise about your honour! If the mischief done to your
blood be all you complain of, I am sure you complain of nothing;
for my blood is as good as yours." "You have no conception,"
replied Wild, "of the tenderness of honour; you know not how nice
and delicate it is in both sexes; so delicate that the least
breath of air which rudely blows on it destroys it." "I will prove
from your own words," says Fireblood, "I have not wronged your
honour. Have you not often told me that the honour of a man
consisted in receiving no affront from his own sex, and that of
woman in receiving no kindness from ours? Now, sir, if I have
given you no affront, how have I injured your honour?" "But doth
not everything," cried Wild, "of the wife belong to the husband? A
married man, therefore, hath his wife's honour as well as his own,
and by injuring hers you injure his. How cruelly you have hurt me
in this tender part I need not repeat; the whole gate knows it,
and the world shall. I will apply to Doctors' Commons for my
redress against her; I will shake off as much of my dishonour as I
can by parting with her; and as for you, expect to hear of me in
Westminster-hall; the modern method of repairing these breaches
and of resenting this affront." "D--n your eyes!" cries Fireblood;
"I fear you not, nor do I believe a word you say." "Nay, if you
affront me personally," says Wild, "another sort of resentment is
prescribed." At which word, advancing to Fireblood, he presented
him with a box on the ear, which the youth immediately returned;
and now our hero and his friend fell to boxing, though with some
difficulty, both being encumbered with the chains which they wore
between their legs: a few blows passed on both sides before the
gentlemen who stood by stept in and parted the combatants; and now
both parties having whispered each other, that, if they outlived
the ensuing sessions and escaped the tree, one should give and the
other should receive satisfaction in single combat, they separated
and the gate soon recovered its former tranquillity.

Mrs. Heartfree was then desired by the justice and her husband
both, to conclude her story, which she did in the words of the
next chapter.




CHAPTER ELEVEN

THE CONCLUSION OF MRS. HEARTFREE'S ADVENTURES.


"If I mistake not, I was interrupted just as I was beginning to
repeat some of the compliments made me by the hermit." "Just as
you had finished them, I believe, madam," said the justice. "Very
well, sir," said she; "I am sure I have no pleasure in the
repetition. He concluded then with telling me, though I was in his
eyes the most charming woman in the world, and might tempt a saint
to abandon the ways of holiness, yet my beauty inspired him with a
much tenderer affection towards me than to purchase any
satisfaction of his own desires with my misery; if therefore I
could be so cruel to him to reject his honest and sincere address,
nor could submit to a solitary life with one who would endeavour
by all possible means to make me happy, I had no force to dread;
for that I was as much at my liberty as if I was in France, or
England, or any other free country. I repulsed him with the same
civility with which he advanced; and told him that, as he
professed great regard to religion, I was convinced he would cease
from all farther solicitation when I informed him that, if I had
no other objection, my own innocence would not admit of my hearing
him on this subject, for that I was married. He started a little
at that word, and was for some time silent; but, at length
recovering himself, he began to urge the uncertainty of my
husband's being alive, and the probability of the contrary. He
then spoke of marriage as of a civil policy only, on which head he
urged many arguments not worth repeating, and was growing so very
eager and importunate that I know not whither his passion might
have hurried him had not three of the sailors, well armed,
appeared at that instant in sight of the cave. I no sooner saw
them than, exulting with the utmost inward joy, I told him my
companions were come for me, and that I must now take my leave of
him; assuring him that I would always remember, with the most
grateful acknowledgment, the favours I had received at his hands.
He fetched a very heavy sigh, and, squeezing me tenderly by the
hand, he saluted my lips with a little more eagerness than the
Europeao you mean by my speaking right? If you was not a parson, I would
not take these words; but your gown protects you. If any man who wears a
sword had said so much, I had pulled him by the nose before this." Adams
replied, "If he attempted any rudeness to his person, he would not find
any protection for himself in his gown;" and, clenching his fist,
declared "he had thrashed many a stouter man." The gentleman did all he
could to encourage this warlike disposition in Adams, and was in hopes
to have produced a battle, but he was disappointed; for the captain made
no other answer than, "It is very well you are a parson;" and so,
drinking off a bumper to old mother Church, ended the dispute.

Then the doctor, who had hitherto been silent, and who was the gravest
but most mischievous dog of all, in a very pompous speech highly
applauded what Adams had said, and as much discommended the behaviour
to him. He proceeded to encomiums on the Church and poverty; and,
lastly, recommended forgiveness of what had passed to Adams, who
immediately answered, "That everything was forgiven;" and in the warmth
of his goodness he filled a bumper of strong beer (a liquor he
preferred to wine), and drank a health to the whole company, shaking
the captain and the poet heartily by the hand, and addressing himself
with great respect to the doctor; who, indeed, had not laughed
outwardly at anything that past, as he had a perfect command of his
muscles, and could laugh inwardly without betraying the least symptoms
in his countenance. The doctor now began a second formal speech, in
which he declaimed against all levity of conversation, and what is
usually called mirth. He said, "There were amusements fitted for
persons of all ages and degrees, from the rattle to the discussing a
point of philosophy; and that men discovered themselves in nothing more
than in the choice of their amusements; for," says he, "as it must
greatly raise our expectation of the future conduct in life of boys
whom in their tender years we perceive, instead of taw or balls, or
other childish playthings, to chuse, at their leisure hours, to
exercise their genius in contentions of wit, learning, and such like;
so must it inspire one with equal contempt of a man, if we should
discover him playing at taw or other childish play." Adams highly
commended the doctor's opinion, and said, "He had often wondered at
some passages in ancient authors, where Scipio, Laelius, and other great
men were represented to have passed many hours in amusements of the
most trifling kind." The doctor replied, "He had by him an old Greek
manuscript where a favourite diversion of Socrates was recorded." "Ay!"
says the parson eagerly; "I should be most infinitely obliged to you
for the favour of perusing it." The doctor promised to send it him, and
farther said, "That he believed he could describe it. I think," says
he, "as near as I can remember, it was this: there was a throne
erected, on one side of which sat a king and on the other a queen, with
their guards and attendants ranged on both sides; to them was
introduced an ambassador, which part Socrates always used to perform
himself; and when he was led up to the footsteps of the throne he
addressed himself to the monarchs in some grave speech, full of virtue,
and goodness, and morality, and such like. After which, he was seated
between the king and queen, and royally entertained. This I think was
the chief part. Perhaps I may have forgot some particulars; for it is
long since I read it." Adams said, "It was, indeed, a diversion worthy
the relaxation of so great a man; and thought something resembling it
should be instituted among our great men, instead of cards and other
idle pastime, in which, he was informed, they trifled away too much of
their lives." He added, "The Christian religion was a nobler subject
for these speeches than any Socrates could have invented." The
gentleman of the house approved what Mr Adams said, and declared "he
was resolved to perform the ceremony this very evening." To which the
doctor objected, as no one was prepared with a speech, "unless," said
he (turning to Adams with a gravity of countenance which would have
deceived a more knowing man), "you have a sermon about you, doctor."
"Sir," said Adams, "I never travel without one, for fear of what may
happen." He was easily prevailed on by his worthy friend, as he now
called the doctor, to undertake the part of the ambassador; so that the
gentleman sent immediate orders to have the throne erected, which was
performed before they had drank two bottles; and, perhaps, the reader
will hereafter have no great reason to admire the nimbleness of the
servants. Indeed, to confess the truth, the throne was no more than
this: there was a great tub of water provided, on each side of which
were placed two stools raised higher than the surface of the tub, and
over the whole was laid a blanket; on these stools were placed the king
and queen, namely, the master of the house and the captain. And now the
ambassador was introduced between the poet and the doctor; who, having
read his sermon, to the great entertainment of all present, was led up
to his place and seated between their majesties. They immediately rose
up, when the blanket, wanting its supports at either end, gave way, and
soused Adams over head and ears in the water. The captain made his
escape, but, unluckily, the gentleman himself not being as nimble as he
ought, Adams caught hold of him before he descended from his throne,
and pulled him in with him, to the entire secret satisfaction of all
the company. Adams, after ducking the squire twice or thrice, leapt out
of the tub, and looked sharp for the doctor, whom he would certainly
have conveyed to the same place of honour; but he had wisely withdrawn:
he then searched for his crabstick, and having found that, as well as
his fellow travellers, he declared he would not stay a moment longer in
such a house. He then departed, without taking leave of his host, whom
he had exacted a more severe revenge on than he intended; for, as he
did not use sufficient care to dry himself in time, he caught a cold by
the accident which threw him into a fever that had like to have cost
him his life.



CHAPTER VIII.

_Which some readers will think too short and others too long._


Adams, and Joseph, who was no less enraged than his friend at the
treatment he met with, went out with their sticks in their hands, and
carried off Fanny, notwithstanding the opposition of the servants, who
did all, without proceeding to violence, in their power to detain them.
They walked as fast as they could, not so much from any apprehension of
being pursued as that Mr Adams might, by exercise, prevent any harm from
the water. The gentleman, who had given such orders to his servants
concerning Fanny that he did not in the least fear her getting away, no
sooner heard that she was gone, than he began to rave, and immediately
despatched several with orders either to bring her back or never return.
The poet, the player, and all but the dancing-master and doctor, went on
this errand.

The night was very dark in which our friends began their journey;
however, they made such expedition, that they soon arrived at an inn
which was at seven miles' distance. Here they unanimously consented to
pass the evening, Mr Adams being now as dry as he was before he had set
out on his embassy.

This inn, which indeed we might call an ale-house, had not the words,
The New Inn, been writ on the sign, afforded them no better provision
than bread and cheese and ale; on which, however, they made a very
comfortable meal; for hunger is better than a French cook.

They had no sooner supped, than Adams, returning thanks to the Almighty
for his food, declared he had eat his homely commons with much greater
satisfaction than his splendid dinner; and expressed great contempt for
the folly of mankind, who sacrificed their hopes of heaven to the
acquisition of vast wealth, since so much comfort was to be found in the
humblest state and the lowest provision. "Very true, sir," says a grave
man who sat smoaking his pipe by the fire, and who was a traveller as
well as himself. "I have often been as much surprized as you are, when I
consider the value which mankind in general set on riches, since every
day's experience shows us how little is in their power; for what,
indeed, truly desirable, can they bestow on us? Can they give beauty to
the deformed, strength to the weak, or health to the infirm? Surely if
they could we should not see so many ill-favoured faces haunting the
assemblies of the great, nor would such numbers of feeble wretches
languish in their coaches and palaces. No, not the wealth of a kingdom
can purchase any paint to dress pale Ugliness in the bloom of that young
maiden, nor any drugs to equip Disease with the vigour of that young
man. Do not riches bring us to solicitude instead of rest, envy instead
of affection, and danger instead of safety? Can they prolong their own
possession, or lengthen his days who enjoys them? So far otherwise, that
the sloth, the luxury, the care which attend them, shorten the lives of
millions, and bring them with pain and misery to an untimely grave.
Where, then, is their value if they can neither embellish nor strengthen
our forms, sweeten nor prolong our lives?--Again: Can they adorn the
mind more than the body? Do they not rather swell the heart with vanity,
puff up the cheeks with pride, shut our ears to every call of virtue,
and our bowels to every motive of compassion?" "Give me your hand,
brother," said Adams, in a rapture, "for I suppose you are a
clergyman."--"No, truly," answered the other (indeed, he was a priest of
the Church of Rome; but those who understand our laws will not wonder he
was not over-ready to own it).--"Whatever you are," cries Adams, "you
have spoken my sentiments: I believe I have preached every syllable of
your speech twenty times over; for it hath always appeared to me easier
for a cable-rope (which by the way is the true rendering of that word we
have translated camel) to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to get into the kingdom of heaven."--"That, sir," said the other,
"will be easily granted you by divines, and is deplorably true; but as
the prospect of our good at a distance doth not so forcibly affect us,
it might be of some service to mankind to be made thoroughly
sensible--which I think they might be with very little serious
attention--that even the blessings of this world are not to be purchased
with riches; a doctrine, in my opinion, not only metaphysically, but, if
I may so say, mathematically demonstrable; and which I have been always
so perfectly convinced of that I have a contempt for nothing so much as
for gold." Adams now began a long discourse: but as most which he said
occurs among many authors who have treated this subject, I shall omit
inserting it. During its continuance Joseph and Fanny retired to rest,
and the host likewise left the room. When the English parson had
concluded, the Romish resumed the discourse, which he continued with
great bitterness and invective; and at last ended by desiring Adams to
lend him eighteen-pence to pay his reckoning; promising, if he never
paid him, he might be assured of his prayers. The good man answered that
eighteen-pence would be too little to carry him any very long journey;
that he had half a guinea in his pocket, which he would divide with him.
He then fell to searching his pockets, but could find no money; for
indeed the company with whom he dined had passed one jest upon him which
we did not then enumerate, and had picked his pocket of all that
treasure which he had so ostentatiously produced.

"Bless me!" cried Adams, "I have certainly lost it; I can never have
spent it. Sir, as I am a Christian, I had a whole half-guinea in my
pocket this morning, and have not now a single halfpenny of it left.
Sure the devil must have taken it from me!"--"Sir," answered the priest,
smiling, "you need make no excuses; if you are not willing to lend me
the money, I am contented."--"Sir," cries Adams, "if I had the greatest
sum in the world--aye, if I had ten pounds about me--I would bestow it
all to rescue any Christian from distress. I am more vexed at my loss on
your account than my own. Was ever anything so unlucky? Because I have
no money in my pocket I shall be suspected to be no Christian."--"I am
more unlucky," quoth the other, "if you are as generous as you say; for
really a crown would have made me happy, and conveyed me in plenty to
the place I am going, which is not above twenty miles off, and where I
can arrive by to-morrow night. I assure you I am not accustomed to
travel pennyless. I am but just arrived in England; and we were forced
by a storm in our passage to throw all we had overboard. I don't suspect
but this fellow will take my word for the trifle I owe him; but I hate
to appear so mean as to confess myself without a shilling to such
people; for these, and indeed too many others, know little difference in
their estimation between a beggar and a thief." However, he thought he
should deal better with the host that evening than the next morning: he
therefore resolved to set out immediately, notwithstanding the darkness;
and accordingly, as soon as the host returned, he communicated to him
the situation of his affairs; upon which the host, scratching his head,
answered, "Why, I do not know, master; if it be so, and you have no
money, I must trust, I think, though I had rather always have ready
money if I could; but, marry, you look like so honest a gentleman that I
don't fear your paying me if it was twenty times as much." The priest
made no reply, but, taking leave of him and Adams as fast as he could,
not without confusion, and perhaps with some distrust of Adams's
sincerity, departed.

He was no sooner gone than the host fell a-shaking his head, and
declared, if he had suspected the fellow had no money, he would not have
drawn him a single drop of drink, saying he despaired of ever seeing his
face again, for that he looked like a confounded rogue.

"Rabbit the fellow," cries he, "I thought, by his talking so much about
riches, that he had a hundred pounds at least in his pocket." Adams chid
him for his suspicions, which, he said, were not becoming a Christian;
and then, without reflecting on his loss, or considering how he himself
should depart in the morning, he retired to a very homely bed, as his
companions had before; however, health and fatigue gave them a sweeter
repose than is often in the power of velvet and down to bestow.



CHAPTER IX.

_Containing as surprizing and bloody adventures as can be found in this
or perhaps any other authentic history._


It was almost morning when Joseph Andrews, whose eyes the thoughts of
his dear Fanny had opened, as he lay fondly meditating on that lovely
creature, heard a violent knocking at the door over which he lay. He
presently jumped out of bed, and, opening the window, was asked if there
were no travellers in the house? and presently, by another voice, if two
men and a woman had not taken up there their lodging that night? Though
he knew not the voices, he began to entertain a suspicion of the
truth--for indeed he had received some information from one of the
servants of the squire's house of his design--and answered in the
negative. One of the servants, who knew the host well, called out to him
by his name just as he had opened another window, and asked him the same
question; to which he answered in the affirmative. O ho! said another,
have we found you? and ordered the host to come down and open his door.
Fanny, who was as wakeful as Joseph, no sooner heard all this than she
leaped from her bed, and, hastily putting on her gown and petticoats,
ran as fast as possible to Joseph's room, who then was almost drest. He
immediately let her in, and, embracing her with the most passionate
tenderness, bid her fear nothing, for he would die in her defence. "Is
that a reason why I should not fear," says she, "when I should lose what
is dearer to me than the whole world?" Joseph, then kissing her hand,
said, "He could almost thank the occasion which had extorted from her a
tenderness she would never indulge him with before." He then ran and
waked his bedfellow Adams, who was yet fast asleep, notwithstanding many
calls from Joseph; but was no sooner made sensible of their danger than
he leaped from his bed, without considering the presence of Fanny, who
hastily turned her face from him, and enjoyed a double benefit from the
dark, which, as it would have prevented any offence, to an innocence
less pure, or a modesty less delicate, so it concealed even those
blushes which were raised in her.

Adams had soon put on all his clothes but his breeches, which, in the
hurry, he forgot; however, they were pretty well supplied by the length
of his other garments; and now, the house-door being opened, the
captain, the poet, the player, and three servants came in. The captain
told the host that two fellows, who were in his house, had run away with
a young woman, and desired to know in which room she lay. The host, who
presently believed the story, directed them, and instantly the captain
and poet, justling one another, ran up. The poet, who was the nimblest,
entering the chamber first, searched the bed, and every other part, but
to no purpose; the bird was flown, as the impatient reader, who might
otherwise have been in pain for her, was before advertised. They then
enquired where the men lay, and were approaching the chamber, when
Joseph roared out, in a loud voice, that he would shoot the first man
who offered to attack the door. The captain enquired what fire-arms they
had; to which the host answered, he believed they had none; nay, he was
almost convinced of it, for he had heard one ask the other in the
evening what they should have done if they had been overtaken, when they
had no arms; to which the other answered, they would have defended
themselves with their sticks as long as they were able, and God would
assist a just cause. This satisfied the captain, but not the poet, who
prudently retreated downstairs, saying, it was his business to record
great actions, and not to do them. The captain was no sooner well
satisfied that there were no fire-arms than, bidding defiance to
gunpowder, and swearing he loved the smell of it, he ordered the
servants to follow him, and, marching boldly up, immediately attempted
to force the door, which the servants soon helped him to accomplish.
When it was opened, they discovered the enemy drawn up three deep; Adams
in the front, and Fanny in the rear. The captain told Adams that if they
would go all back to the house again they should be civilly treated; but
unless they consented he had orders to carry the young lady with him,
whom there was great reason to believe they had stolen from her parents;
for, notwithstanding her disguise, her air, which she could not conceal,
sufficiently discovered her birth to be infinitely superior to theirs.
Fanny, bursting into tears, solemnly assured him he was mistaken; that
she was a poor helpless foundling, and had no relation in the world
which she knew of; and, throwing herself on her knees, begged that he
would not attempt to take her from her friends, who, she was convinced,
would die before they would lose her; which Adams confirmed with words
not far from amounting to an oath. The captain swore he had no leisure
to talk, and, bidding them thank themselves for what happened, he
ordered the servants to fall on, at the same time endeavouring to pass
by Adams, in order to lay hold on Fanny; but the parson, interrupting
him, received a blow from one of them, which, without considering whence
it came, he returned to the captain, and gave him so dexterous a knock
in that part of the stomach which is vulgarly called the pit, that he
staggered some paces backwards. The captain, who was not accustomed to
this kind of play, and who wisely apprehended the consequence of such
another blow, two of them seeming to him equal to a thrust through the
body, drew forth his hanger, as Adams approached him, and was levelling
a blow at his head, which would probably have silenced the preacher for
ever, had not Joseph in that instant lifted up a certain huge stone pot
of the chamber with one hand, which six beaus could not have lifted with
both, and discharged it, together with the contents, full in the
captain's face. The uplifted hanger dropped from his hand, and he fell
prostrated on the floor with a lumpish noise, and his halfpence rattled
in his pocket; the red liquor which his veins contained, and the white
liquor which the pot contained, ran in one stream down his face and his
clothes. Nor had Adams quite escaped, some of the water having in its
passage shed its honours on his head, and began to trickle down the
wrinkles or rather furrows of his cheeks, when one of the servants,
snatching a mop out of a pail of water, which had already done its duty
in washing the house, pushed it in the parson's face; yet could not he
bear him down, for the parson, wresting the mop from the fellow with one
hand, with the other brought his enemy as low as the earth, having given
him a stroke over that part of the face where, in some men of pleasure,
the natural and artificial noses are conjoined.

Hitherto, Fortune seemed to incline the victory on the travellers' side,
when, according to her custom, she began to show the fickleness of her
disposition; for now the host, entering the field, or rather chamber of
battle, flew directly at Joseph, and, darting his head into his stomach
(for he was a stout fellow and an expert boxer), almost staggered him:
but Joseph, stepping one leg back, did with his left hand so chuck him
under the chin that he reeled. The youth was pursuing his blow with his
right hand when he received from one of the servants such a stroke with
a cudgel on his temples, that it instantly deprived him of sense, and he
measured his length on the ground.

Fanny rent the air with her cries, and Adams was coming to the
assistance of Joseph; but the two serving-men and the host now fell on
him, and soon subdued him, though he fought like a madman, and looked so
black with the impressions he had received from the mop, that Don
Quixote would certainly have taken him for an inchanted Moor. But now
follows the most tragical part; for the captain was risen again, and,
seeing Joseph on the floor, and Adams secured, he instantly laid hold on
Fanny, and, with the assistance of the poet and player, who, hearing the
battle was over, were now come up, dragged her, crying and tearing her
hair, from the sight of her Joseph, and, with a perfect deafness to all
her entreaties, carried her downstairs by violence, and fastened her on
the player's horse; and the captain, mounting his own, and leading that
on which this poor miserable wretch was, departed, without any more
consideration of her cries than a butcher hath of those of a lamb; for
indeed his thoughts were entertained only with the degree of favour
which he promised himself from the squire on the success of this
adventure.

The servants, who were ordered to secure Adams and Joseph as safe as
possible, that the squire might receive no interruption to his design on
poor Fanny, immediately, by the poet's advice, tied Adams to one of the
bed-posts, as they did Joseph on the other side, as soon as they could
bring him to himself; and then, leaving them together, back to back, and
desiring the host not to set them at liberty, nor to go near them, till
he had further orders, they departed towards their master; but happened
to take a different road from that which the captain had fallen into.



CHAPTER X.

_A discourse between the poet and the player; of no other use in this
history but to divert the reader._


Before we proceed any farther in this tragedy we shall leave Mr Joseph
and Mr Adams to themselves, and imitate the wise conductors of the
stage, who in the midst of a grave action entertain you with some
excellent piece of satire or humour called a dance. Which piece, indeed,
is therefore danced, and not spoke, as it is delivered to the audience
by persons whose thinking faculty is by most people held to lie in their
heels; and to whom, as well as heroes, who think with their hands,
Nature hath only given heads for the sake of conformity, and as they are
of use in dancing, to hang their hats on.

The poet, addressing the player, proceeded thus, "As I was saying" (for
they had been at this discourse all the time of the engagement
above-stairs), "the reason you have no good new plays is evident; it is
from your discouragement of authors. Gentlemen will not write, sir, they
will not write, without the expectation of fame or profit, or perhaps
both. Plays are like trees, which will not grow without nourishment; but
like mushrooms, they shoot up spontaneously, as it were, in a rich soil.
The muses, like vines, may be pruned, but not with a hatchet. The town,
like a peevish child, knows not what it desires, and is always best
pleased with a rattle. A farce-writer hath indeed some chance for
success: but they have lost all taste for the sublime. Though I believe
one reason of their depravity is the badness of the actors. If a man
writes like an angel, sir, those fellows know not how to give a
sentiment utterance."--"Not so fast," says the player: "the modern
actors are as good at least as their authors, nay, they come nearer
their illustrious predecessors; and I expect a Booth on the stage again,
sooner than a Shakespear or an Otway; and indeed I may turn your
observation against you, and with truth say, that the reason no authors
are encouraged is because we have no good new plays."--"I have not
affirmed the contrary," said the poet; "but I am surprized you grow so
warm; you cannot imagine yourself interested in this dispute; I hope you
have a better opinion of my taste than to apprehend I squinted at
yourself. No, sir, if we had six such actors as you, we should soon
rival the Bettertons and Sandfords of former times; for, without a
compliment to you, I think it impossible for any one to have excelled
you in most of your parts. Nay, it is solemn truth, and I have heard
many, and all great judges, express as much; and, you will pardon me if
I tell you, I think every time I have seen you lately you have
constantly acquired some new excellence, like a snowball. You have
deceived me in my estimation of perfection, and have outdone what I
thought inimitable."--"You are as little interested," answered the
player, "in what I have said of other poets; for d--n me if there are
not many strokes, ay, whole scenes, in your last tragedy, which at least
equal Shakespear. There is a delicacy of sentiment, a dignity of
expression in it, which I will own many of our gentlemen did not do
adequate justice to. To confess the truth, they are bad enough, and I
pity an author who is present at the murder of his works."--"Nay, it is
but seldom that it can happen," returned the poet; "the works of most
modern authors, like dead-born children, cannot be murdered. It is such
wretched half-begotten, half-writ, lifeless, spiritless, low, grovelling
stuff, that I almost pity the actor who is obliged to get it by heart,
which must be almost as difficult to remember as words in a language you
don't understand."--"I am sure," said the player, "if the sentences have
little meaning when they are writ, when they are spoken they have less.
I know scarce one who ever lays an emphasis right, and much less adapts
his action to his character. I have seen a tender lover in an attitude
of fighting with his mistress, and a brave hero suing to his enemy with
his sword in his hand. I don't care to abuse my profession, but rot me
if in my heart I am not inclined to the poet's side."--"It is rather
generous in you than just," said the poet; "and, though I hate to speak
ill of any person's production--nay, I never do it, nor will--but yet,
to do justice to the actors, what could Booth or Betterton have made of
such horrible stuff as Fenton's Mariamne, Frowd's Philotas, or Mallet's
Eurydice; or those low, dirty, last-dying-speeches, which a fellow in
the city of Wapping, your Dillo or Lillo, what was his name, called
tragedies?"--"Very well," says the player; "and pray what do you think
of such fellows as Quin and Delane, or that face-making puppy young
Cibber, that ill-looked dog Macklin, or that saucy slut Mrs Clive? What
work would they make with your Shakespears, Otways, and Lees? How would
those harmonious lines of the last come from their tongues?--

    "'--No more; for I disdain
    All pomp when thou art by: far be the noise
    Of kings and crowns from us, whose gentle souls
    Our kinder fates have steer'd another way.
    Free as the forest birds we'll pair together,
    Without rememb'ring who our fathers were:
    Fly to the arbors, grots, and flow'ry meads;
    There in soft murmurs interchange our souls;
    Together drink the crystal of the stream,
    Or taste the yellow fruit which autumn yields,
    And, when the golden evening calls us home,
    Wing to our downy nests, and sleep till morn.'

"Or how would this disdain of Otway--

    "'Who'd be that foolish sordid thing call'd man?'"

"Hold! hold! hold!" said the poet: "Do repeat that tender speech in the
third act of my play which you made such a figure in."--"I would
willingly," said the player, "but I have forgot it."--"Ay, you was not
quite perfect in it when you played it," cries the poet, "or you would
have had such an applause as was never given on the stage; an applause I
was extremely concerned for your losing."--"Sure," says the player, "if
I remember, that was hissed more than any passage in the whole
play."--"Ay, your speaking it was hissed," said the poet.--"My speaking
it!" said the player.--"I mean your not speaking it," said the poet.
"You was out, and then they hissed."--"They hissed, and then I was out,
if I remember," answered the player; "and I must say this for myself,
that the whole audience allowed I did your part justice; so don't lay
the damnation of your play to my account."--"I don't know what you mean
by damnation," replied the poet.--"Why, you know it was acted but one
night," cried the player.--"No," said the poet, "you and the whole town
were enemies; the pit were all my enemies, fellows that would cut my
throat, if the fear of hanging did not restrain them. All taylors, sir,
all taylors."--"Why should the taylors be so angry with you?" cries the
player. "I suppose you don't employ so many in making your clothes."--"I
admit your jest," answered the poet; "but you remember the affair as
well as myself; you know there was a party in the pit and upper gallery
that would not suffer it to be given out again; though much, ay
infinitely, the majority, all the boxes in particular, were desirous of
it; nay, most of the ladies swore they never would come to the house
till it was acted again. Indeed, I must own their policy was good in not
letting it be given out a second time: for the rascals knew if it had
gone a second night it would have run fifty; for if ever there was
distress in a tragedy--I am not fond of my own performance; but if I
should tell you what the best judges said of it--Nor was it entirely
owing to my enemies neither that it did not succeed on the stage as well
as it hath since among the polite readers; for you can't say it had
justice done it by the performers."--"I think," answered the player,
"the performers did the distress of it justice; for I am sure we were in
distress enough, who were pelted with oranges all the last act: we all
imagined it would have been the last act of our lives."

The poet, whose fury was now raised, had just attempted to answer when
they were interrupted, and an end put to their discourse, by an
accident, which if the reader is impatient to know, he must skip over
the next chapter, which is a sort of counterpart to this, and contains
some of the best and gravest matters in the whole book, being a
discourse between parson Abraham Adams and Mr Joseph Andrews.



CHAPTER XI.

_Containing the exhortations of parson Adams to his friend in
affliction; calculated for the instruction and improvement of the
reader._


Joseph no sooner came perfectly to himself than, perceiving his mistress
gone, he bewailed her loss with groans which would have pierced any
heart but those which are possessed by some people, and are made of a
certain composition not unlike flint in its hardness and other
properties; for you may strike fire from them, which will dart through
the eyes, but they can never distil one drop of water the same way. His
own, poor youth! was of a softer composition; and at those words, "O my
dear Fanny! O my love! shall I never, never see thee more?" his eyes
overflowed with tears, which would have become any but a hero. In a
word, his despair was more easy to be conceived than related.

Mr Adams, after many groans, sitting with his back to Joseph, began thus
in a sorrowful tone: "You cannot imagine, my good child, that I entirely
blame these first agonies of your grief; for, when misfortunes attack us
by surprize, it must require infinitely more learning than you are
master of to resist them; but it is the business of a man and a
Christian to summon Reason as quickly as he can to his aid; and she will
presently teach him patience and submission. Be comforted, therefore,
child; I say be comforted. It is true, you have lost the prettiest,
kindest, loveliest, sweetest young woman, one with whom you might have
expected to have lived in happiness, virtue, and innocence; by whom you
might have promised yourself many little darlings, who would have been
the delight of your youth and the comfort of your age. You have not only
lost her, but have reason to fear the utmost violence which lust and
power can inflict upon her. Now, indeed, you may easily raise ideas of
horror, which might drive you to despair."--"O I shall run mad!" cries
Joseph. "O that I could but command my hands to tear my eyes out and my
flesh off!"--"If you would use them to such purposes, I am glad you
can't," answered Adams. "I have stated your misfortune as strong as I
possibly can; but, on the other side, you are to consider you are a
Christian, that no accident happens to us without the Divine permission,
and that it is the duty of a man, and a Christian, to submit. We did not
make ourselves; but the same power which made us rules over us, and we
are absolutely at his disposal; he may do with us what he pleases, nor
have we any right to complain. A second reason against our complaint is
our ignorance; for, as we know not future events, so neither can we tell
to what purpose any accident tends; and that which at first threatens us
with evil may in the end produce our good. I should indeed have said our
ignorance is twofold (but I have not at present time to divide
properly), for, as we know not to what purpose any event is ultimately
directed, so neither can we affirm from what cause it originally sprung.
You are a man, and consequently a sinner; and this may be a punishment
to you for your sins: indeed in this sense it may be esteemed as a good,
yea, as the greatest good, which satisfies the anger of Heaven, and
averts that wrath which cannot continue without our destruction.
Thirdly, our impotency of relieving ourselves demonstrates the folly and
absurdity of our complaints: for whom do we resist, or against whom do
we complain, but a power from whose shafts no armour can guard us, no
speed can fly?--a power which leaves us no hope but in submission." "O
sir!" cried Joseph, "all this is very true, and very fine, and I could
hear you all day if I was not so grieved at heart as now I am."--"Would
you take physic," says Adams, "when you are well, and refuse it when you
are sick? Is not comfort to be administered to the afflicted, and not to
those who rejoice or those who are at ease?" "O! you have not spoken one
word of comfort to me yet!" returned Joseph. "No!" cries Adams; "what am
I then doing? what can I say to comfort you?" "O tell me," cries Joseph,
"that Fanny will escape back to my arms, that they shall again enclose
that lovely creature, with all her sweetness, all her untainted
innocence about her!" "Why, perhaps you may," cries Adams, "but I can't
promise you what's to come. You must, with perfect resignation, wait the
event: if she be restored to you again, it is your duty to be thankful,
and so it is if she be not. Joseph, if you are wise and truly know your
own interest, you will peaceably and quietly submit to all the
dispensations of Providence, being thoroughly assured that all the
misfortunes, how great soever, which happen to the righteous, happen to
them for their own good. Nay, it is not your interest only, but your
duty, to abstain from immoderate grief; which if you indulge, you are
not worthy the name of a Christian." He spoke these last words with an
accent a little severer than usual; upon which Joseph begged him not to
be angry, saying, he mistook him if he thought he denied it was his
duty, for he had known that long ago. "What signifies knowing your duty,
if you do not perform it?" answered Adams. "Your knowledge increases
your guilt. O Joseph! I never thought you had this stubbornness in your
mind." Joseph replied, "He fancied he misunderstood him; which I assure
you," says he, "you do, if you imagine I endeavour to grieve; upon my
soul I don't." Adams rebuked him for swearing, and then proceeded to
enlarge on the folly of grief, telling him, all the wise men and
philosophers, even among the heathens, had written against it, quoting
several passages from Seneca, and the Consolation, which, though it was
not Cicero's, was, he said, as good almost as any of his works; and
concluded all by hinting that immoderate grief in this case might
incense that power which alone could restore him his Fanny. This reason,
or indeed rather the idea which it raised of the restoration of his
mistress, had more effect than all which the parson had said before, and
for a moment abated his agonies; but, when his fears sufficiently set
before his eyes the danger that poor creature was in, his grief returned
again with repeated violence, nor could Adams in the least asswage it;
though it may be doubted in his behalf whether Socrates himself could
have prevailed any better.

They remained some time in silence, and groans and sighs issued from
them both; at length Joseph burst out into the following soliloquy:--

    "Yes, I will bear my sorrows like a man,
    But I must also feel them as a man.
    I cannot but remember such things were,
    And were most dear to me."

Adams asked him what stuff that was he repeated? To which he answered,
they were some lines he had gotten by heart out of a play. "Ay, there is
nothing but heathenism to be learned from plays," replied he. "I never
heard of any plays fit for a Christian to read, but Cato and the
Conscious Lovers; and, I must own, in the latter there are some things
almost solemn enough for a sermon." But we shall now leave them a
little, and enquire after the subject of their conversation.



CHAPTER XII.

_More adventures, which we hope will as much please as surprize
the reader._


Neither the facetious dialogue which passed between the poet and the
player, nor the grave and truly solemn discourse of Mr Adams, will, we
conceive, make the reader sufficient amends for the anxiety which he
must have felt on the account of poor Fanny, whom we left in so
deplorable a condition. We shall therefore now proceed to the relation
of what happened to that beautiful and innocent virgin, after she fell
into the wicked hands of the captain.

The man of war, having conveyed his charming prize out of the inn a
little before day, made the utmost expedition in his power towards the
squire's house, where this delicate creature was to be offered up a
sacrifice to the lust of a ravisher. He was not only deaf to all her
bewailings and entreaties on the road, but accosted her ears with
impurities which, having been never before accustomed to them, she
happily for herself very little understood. At last he changed his note,
and attempted to soothe and mollify her, by setting forth the splendor
and luxury which would be her fortune with a man who would have the
inclination, and power too, to give her whatever her utmost wishes could
desire; and told her he doubted not but she would soon look kinder on
him, as the instrument of her happiness, and despise that pitiful fellow
whom her ignorance only could make her fond of. She answered, she knew
not whom he meant; she never was fond of any pitiful fellow. "Are you
affronted, madam," says he, "at my calling him so? But what better can
be said of one in a livery, notwithstanding your fondness for him?" She
returned, that she did not understand him, that the man had been her
fellow-servant, and she believed was as honest a creature as any alive;
but as for fondness for men--"I warrant ye," cries the captain, "we
shall find means to persuade you to be fond; and I advise you to yield
to gentle ones, for you may be assured that it is not in your power, by
any struggles whatever, to preserve your virginity two hours longer. It
will be your interest to consent; for the squire will be much kinder to
you if he enjoys you willingly than by force." At which words she began
to call aloud for assistance (for it was now open day), but, finding
none, she lifted her eyes to heaven, and supplicated the Divine
assistance to preserve her innocence. The captain told her, if she
persisted in her vociferation, he would find a means of stopping her
mouth. And now the poor wretch, perceiving no hopes of succour,
abandoned herself to despair, and, sighing out the name of Joseph!
Joseph! a river of tears ran down her lovely cheeks, and wet the
handkerchief which covered her bosom. A horseman now appeared in the
road, upon which the captain threatened her violently if she complained;
however, the moment they approached each other she begged him with the
utmost earnestness to relieve a distressed creature who was in the hands
of a ravisher. The fellow stopt at those words, but the captain assured
him it was his wife, and that he was carrying her home from her
adulterer, which so satisfied the fellow, who was an old one (and
perhaps a married one too), that he wished him a good journey, and rode
on. He was no sooner past than the captain abused her violently for
breaking his commands, and threatened to gagg her, when two more
horsemen, armed with pistols, came into the road just before them. She
again solicited their assistance, and the captain told the same story as
before. Upon which one said to the other, "That's a charming wench,
Jack; I wish I had been in the fellow's place, whoever he is." But the
other, instead of answering him, cried out, "Zounds, I know her;" and
then, turning to her, said, "Sure you are not Fanny Goodwill?"--"Indeed,
indeed, I am," she cried--"O John, I know you now-Heaven hath sent you
to my assistance, to deliver me from this wicked man, who is carrying me
away for his vile purposes--O for God's sake rescue me from him!" A
fierce dialogue immediately ensued between the captain and these two
men, who, being both armed with pistols, and the chariot which they
attended being now arrived, the captain saw both force and stratagem
were vain, and endeavoured to make his escape, in which however he could
not succeed. The gentleman who rode in the chariot ordered it to stop,
and with an air of authority examined into the merits of the cause; of
which being advertised by Fanny, whose credit was confirmed by the
fellow who knew her, he ordered the captain, who was all bloody from his
encounter at the inn, to be conveyed as a prisoner behind the chariot,
and very gallantly took Fanny into it; for, to say the truth, this
gentleman (who was no other than the celebrated Mr Peter Pounce, and who
preceded the Lady Booby only a few miles, by setting out earlier in the
morning) was a very gallant person, and loved a pretty girl better than
anything besides his own money or the money of other people.

The chariot now proceeded towards the inn, which, as Fanny was informed,
lay in their way, and where it arrived at that very time while the poet
and player were disputing below-stairs, and Adams and Joseph were
discoursing back to back above; just at that period to which we brought
them both in the two preceding chapters the chariot stopt at the door,
and in an instant Fanny, leaping from it, ran up to her Joseph.--O
reader! conceive if thou canst the joy which fired the breasts of these
lovers on this meeting; and if thy own heart doth not sympathetically
assist thee in this conception, I pity thee sincerely from my own; for
let the hard-hearted villain know this, that there is a pleasure in a
tender sensation beyond any which he is capable of tasting.

Peter, being informed by Fanny of the presence of Adams, stopt to see
him, and receive his homage; for, as Peter was an hypocrite, a sort of
people whom Mr Adams never saw through, the one paid that respect to his
seeming goodness which the other believed to be paid to his riches;
hence Mr Adams was so much his favourite, that he once lent him four
pounds thirteen shillings and sixpence to prevent his going to gaol, on
no greater security than a bond and judgment, which probably he would
have made no use of, though the money had not been (as it was) paid
exactly at the time.

It is not perhaps easy to describe the figure of Adams; he had risen in
such a hurry, that he had on neither breeches, garters, nor stockings;
nor had he taken from his head a red spotted handkerchief, which by
night bound his wig, turned inside out, around his head. He had on his
torn cassock and his greatcoat; but, as the remainder of his cassock
hung down below his greatcoat, so did a small stripe of white, or rather
whitish, linen appear below that; to which we may add the several
colours which appeared on his face, where a long piss-burnt beard served
to retain the liquor of the stone-pot, and that of a blacker hue which
distilled from the mop.--This figure, which Fanny had delivered from his
captivity, was no sooner spied by Peter than it disordered the composed
gravity of his muscles; however, he advised him immediately to make
himself clean, nor would accept his homage in that pickle.

The poet and player no sooner saw the captain in captivity than they
began to consider of their own safety, of which flight presented itself
as the only means; they therefore both of them mounted the poet's horse,
and made the most expeditious retreat in their power.

The host, who well knew Mr Pounce and Lady Booby's livery, was not a
little surprized at this change of the scene; nor was his confusion much
helped by his wife, who was now just risen, and, having heard from him
the account of what had passed, comforted him with a decent number of
fools and blockheads; asked him why he did not consult her, and told him
he would never leave following the nonsensical dictates of his own
numskull till she and her family were ruined.

Joseph, being informed of the captain's arrival, and seeing his Fanny
now in safety, quitted her a moment, and, running downstairs, went
directly to him, and stripping off his coat, challenged him to fight;
but the captain refused, saying he did not understand boxing. He then
grasped a cudgel in one hand, and, catching the captain by the collar
with the other, gave him a most severe drubbing, and ended with telling
him he had now had some revenge for what his dear Fanny had suffered.

When Mr Pounce had a little regaled himself with some provision which he
had in his chariot, and Mr Adams had put on the best appearance his
clothes would allow him, Pounce ordered the captain into his presence,
for he said he was guilty of felony, and the next justice of peace
should commit him; but the servants (whose appetite for revenge is soon
satisfied), being sufficiently contented with the drubbing which Joseph
had inflicted on him, and which was indeed of no very moderate kind, had
suffered him to go off, which he did, threatening a severe revenge
against Joseph, which I have never heard he thought proper to take.

The mistress of the house made her voluntary appearance before Mr
Pounce, and with a thousand curtsies told him, "She hoped his honour
would pardon her husband, who was a very nonsense man, for the sake of
his poor family; that indeed if he could be ruined alone, she should be
very willing of it; for because as why, his worship very well knew he
deserved it; but she had three poor small children, who were not capable
to get their own living; and if her husband was sent to gaol, they must
all come to the parish; for she was a poor weak woman, continually
a-breeding, and had no time to work for them. She therefore hoped his
honour would take it into his worship's consideration, and forgive her
husband this time; for she was sure he never intended any harm to man,
woman, or child; and if it was not for that block-head of his own, the
man in some things was well enough; for she had had three children by
him in less than three years, and was almost ready to cry out the fourth
time." She would have proceeded in this manner much longer, had not
Peter stopt her tongue, by telling her he had nothing to say to her
husband nor her neither. So, as Adams and the rest had assured her of
forgiveness, she cried and curtsied out of the room.

Mr Pounce was desirous that Fanny should continue her journey with him
in the chariot; but she absolutely refused, saying she would ride behind
Joseph on a horse which one of Lady Booby's servants had equipped him
with. But, alas! when the horse appeared, it was found to be no other
than that identical beast which Mr Adams had left behind him at the inn,
and which these honest fellows, who knew him, had redeemed. Indeed,
whatever horse they had provided for Joseph, they would have prevailed
with him to mount none, no, not even to ride before his beloved Fanny,
till the parson was supplied; much less would he deprive his friend of
the beast which belonged to him, and which he knew the moment he saw,
though Adams did not; however, when he was reminded of the affair, and
told that they had brought the horse with them which he left behind, he
answered--Bless me! and so I did.

Adams was very desirous that Joseph and Fanny should mount this horse,
and declared he could very easily walk home. "If I walked alone," says
he, "I would wage a shilling that the pedestrian outstripped the
equestrian travellers; but, as I intend to take the company of a pipe,
peradventure I may be an hour later." One of the servants whispered
Joseph to take him at his word, and suffer the old put to walk if he
would: this proposal was answered with an angry look and a peremptory
refusal by Joseph, who, catching Fanny up in his arms, averred he would
rather carry her home in that manner, than take away Mr Adams's horse
and permit him to walk on foot.

Perhaps, reader, thou hast seen a contest between two gentlemen, or two
ladies, quickly decided, though they have both asserted they would not
eat such a nice morsel, and each insisted on the other's accepting it;
but in reality both were very desirous to swallow it themselves. Do not
therefore conclude hence that this dispute would have come to a speedy
decision: for here both parties were heartily in earnest, and it is very
probable they would have remained in the inn-yard to this day, had not
the good Peter Pounce put a stop to it; for, finding he had no longer
hopes of satisfying his old appetite with Fanny, and being desirous of
having some one to whom he might communicate his grandeur, he told the
parson he would convey him home in his chariot. This favour was by
Adams, with many bows and acknowledgments, accepted, though he
afterwards said, "he ascended the chariot rather that he might not
offend than from any desire of riding in it, for that in his heart he
preferred the pedestrian even to the vehicular expedition." All matters
being now settled, the chariot, in which rode Adams and Pounce, moved
forwards; and Joseph having borrowed a pillion from the host, Fanny had
just seated herself thereon, and had laid hold of the girdle which her
lover wore for that purpose, when the wise beast, who concluded that one
at a time was sufficient, that two to one were odds, &c., discovered
much uneasiness at his double load, and began to consider his hinder as
his fore legs, moving the direct contrary way to that which is called
forwards. Nor could Joseph, with all his horsemanship, persuade him to
advance; but, without having any regard to the lovely part of the lovely
girl which was on his back, he used such agitations, that, had not one
of the men come immediately to her assistance, she had, in plain
English, tumbled backwards on the ground. This inconvenience was
presently remedied by an exchange of horses; and then Fanny being again
placed on her pillion, on a better-natured and somewhat a better-fed
beast, the parson's horse, finding he had no longer odds to contend
with, agreed to march; and the whole procession set forwards for
Booby-hall, where they arrived in a few hours without anything
remarkable happening on the road, unless it was a curious dialogue
between the parson and the steward: which, to use the language of a late
Apologist, a pattern to all biographers, "waits for the reader in the
next chapter."



CHAPTER XIII.

_A curious dialogue which passed between Mr Abraham Adams and Mr Peter
Pounce, better worth reading than all the works of Colley Cibber and
many others._


The chariot had not proceeded far before Mr Adams observed it was a very
fine day. "Ay, and a very fine country too," answered Pounce.--"I should
think so more," returned Adams, "if I had not lately travelled over the
Downs, which I take to exceed this and all other prospects in the
universe."--"A fig for prospects!" answered Pounce; "one acre here is
worth ten there; and for my own part, I have no delight in the prospect
of any land but my own."--"Sir," said Adams, "you can indulge yourself
with many fine prospects of that kind."--"I thank God I have a little,"
replied the other, "with which I am content, and envy no man: I have a
little, Mr Adams, with which I do as much good as I can." Adams
answered, "That riches without charity were nothing worth; for that they
were a blessing only to him who made them a blessing to others."--"You
and I," said Peter, "have different notions of charity. I own, as it is
generally used, I do not like the word, nor do I think it becomes one of
us gentlemen; it is a mean parson-like quality; though I would not infer
many parsons have it neither."--"Sir," said Adams, "my definition of
charity is, a generous disposition to relieve the distressed."--"There
is something in that definition," answered Peter, "which I like well
enough; it is, as you say, a disposition, and does not so much consist
in the act as in the disposition to do it. But, alas! Mr Adams, who are
meant by the distressed? Believe me, the distresses of mankind are
mostly imaginary, and it would be rather folly than goodness to relieve
them."--"Sure, sir," replied Adams, "hunger and thirst, cold and
nakedness, and other distresses which attend the poor, can never be said
to be imaginary evils."--"How can any man complain of hunger," said
Peter, "in a country where such excellent salads are to be gathered in
almost every field? or of thirst, where every river and stream produces
such delicious potations? And as for cold and nakedness, they are evils
introduced by luxury and custom. A man naturally wants clothes no more
than a horse or any other animal; and there are whole nations who go
without them; but these are things perhaps which you, who do not know
the world"--"You will pardon me, sir," returned Adams; "I have read of
the Gymnosophists."--"A plague of your Jehosaphats!" cried Peter; "the
greatest fault in our constitution is the provision made for the poor,
except that perhaps made for some others. Sir, I have not an estate
which doth not contribute almost as much again to the poor as to the
land-tax; and I do assure you I expect to come myself to the parish in
the end." To which Adams giving a dissenting smile, Peter thus
proceeded: "I fancy, Mr Adams, you are one of those who imagine I am a
lump of money; for there are many who, I fancy, believe that not only my
pockets, but my whole clothes, are lined with bank-bills; but I assure
you, you are all mistaken; I am not the man the world esteems me. If I
can hold my head above water it is all I can. I have injured myself by
purchasing. I have been too liberal of my money. Indeed, I fear my heir
will find my affairs in a worse situation than they are reputed to be.
Ah! he will have reason to wish I had loved money more and land less.
Pray, my good neighbour, where should I have that quantity of riches the
world is so liberal to bestow on me? Where could I possibly, without I
had stole it, acquire such a treasure?" "Why, truly," says Adams, "I
have been always of your opinion; I have wondered as well as yourself
with what confidence they could report such things of you, which have to
me appeared as mere impossibilities; for you know, sir, and I have often
heard you say it, that your wealth is of your own acquisition; and can
it be credible that in your short time you should have amassed such a
heap of treasure as these people will have you worth? Indeed, had you
inherited an estate like Sir Thomas Booby, which had descended in your
family for many generations, they might have had a colour for their
assertions." "Why, what do they say I am worth?" cries Peter, with a
malicious sneer. "Sir," answered Adams, "I have heard some aver you are
not worth less than twenty thousand pounds." At which Peter frowned.
"Nay, sir," said Adams, "you ask me only the opinion of others; for my
own part, I have always denied it, nor did I ever believe you could
possibly be worth half that sum." "However, Mr Adams," said he,
squeezing him by the hand, "I would not sell them all I am worth for
double that sum; and as to what you believe, or they believe, I care not
a fig, no not a fart. I am not poor because you think me so, nor because
you attempt to undervalue me in the country. I know the envy of mankind
very well; but I thank Heaven I am above them. It is true, my wealth is
of my own acquisition. I have not an estate, like Sir Thomas Booby, that
has descended in my family through many generations; but I know heirs of
such estates who are forced to travel about the country like some people
in torn cassocks, and might be glad to accept of a pitiful curacy for
what I know. Yes, sir, as shabby fellows as yourself, whom no man of my
figure, without that vice of good-nature about him, would suffer to ride
in a chariot with him." "Sir," said Adams, "I value not your chariot of
a rush; and if I had known you had intended to affront me, I would have
walked to the world's end on foot ere I would have accepted a place in
it. However, sir, I will soon rid you of that inconvenience;" and, so
saying, he opened the chariot door, without calling to the coachman, and
leapt out into the highway, forgetting to take his hat along with him;
which, however, Mr Pounce threw after him with great violence. Joseph
and Fanny stopt to bear him company the rest of the way, which was not
above a mile.




BOOK IV.



CHAPTER I.

_The arrival of Lady Booby and the rest at Booby-hall._


The coach and six, in which Lady Booby rode, overtook the other
travellers as they entered the parish. She no sooner saw Joseph than her
cheeks glowed with red, and immediately after became as totally pale.
She had in her surprize almost stopt her coach; but recollected herself
timely enough to prevent it. She entered the parish amidst the ringing
of bells and the acclamations of the poor, who were rejoiced to see
their patroness returned after so long an absence, during which time all
her rents had been drafted to London, without a shilling being spent
among them, which tended not a little to their utter impoverishing; for,
if the court would be severely missed in such a city as London, how much
more must the absence of a person of great fortune be felt in a little
country village, for whose inhabitants such a family finds a constant
employment and supply; and with the offals of whose table the infirm,
aged, and infant poor are abundantly fed, with a generosity which hath
scarce a visible effect on their benefactors' pockets!

But, if their interest inspired so public a joy into every
countenance, how much more forcibly did the affection which they bore
parson Adams operate upon all who beheld his return! They flocked
about him like dutiful children round an indulgent parent, and vyed
with each other in demonstrations of duty and love. The parson on his
side shook every one by the hand, enquired heartily after the healths
of all that were absent, of their children, and relations; and exprest
a satisfaction in his face which nothing but benevolence made happy by
its objects could infuse.

Nor did Joseph and Fanny want a hearty welcome from all who saw them. In
short, no three persons could be more kindly received, as, indeed, none
ever more deserved to be universally beloved.

Adams carried his fellow-travellers home to his house, where he insisted
on their partaking whatever his wife, whom, with his children, he found
in health and joy, could provide:--where we shall leave them enjoying
perfect happiness over a homely meal, to view scenes of greater
splendour, but infinitely less bliss.

Our more intelligent readers will doubtless suspect, by this second
appearance of Lady Booby on the stage, that all was not ended by the
dismission of Joseph; and, to be honest with them, they are in the
right: the arrow had pierced deeper than she imagined; nor was the wound
so easily to be cured. The removal of the object soon cooled her rage,
but it had a different effect on her love; that departed with his
person, but this remained lurking in her mind with his image. Restless,
interrupted slumbers, and confused horrible dreams were her portion the
first night. In the morning, fancy painted her a more delicious scene;
but to delude, not delight her; for, before she could reach the promised
happiness, it vanished, and left her to curse, not bless, the vision.

She started from her sleep, her imagination being all on fire with the
phantom, when, her eyes accidentally glancing towards the spot where
yesterday the real Joseph had stood, that little circumstance raised his
idea in the liveliest colours in her memory. Each look, each word, each
gesture rushed back on her mind with charms which all his coldness could
not abate. Nay, she imputed that to his youth, his folly, his awe, his
religion, to everything but what would instantly have produced contempt,
want of passion for the sex, or that which would have roused her hatred,
want of liking to her.

Reflection then hurried her farther, and told her she must see this
beautiful youth no more; nay, suggested to her that she herself had
dismissed him for no other fault than probably that of too violent an
awe and respect for herself; and which she ought rather to have esteemed
a merit, the effects of which were besides so easily and surely to have
been removed; she then blamed, she cursed the hasty rashness of her
temper; her fury was vented all on herself, and Joseph appeared innocent
in her eyes. Her passion at length grew so violent, that it forced her
on seeking relief, and now she thought of recalling him: but pride
forbad that; pride, which soon drove all softer passions from her soul,
and represented to her the meanness of him she was fond of. That thought
soon began to obscure his beauties; contempt succeeded next, and then
disdain, which presently introduced her hatred of the creature who had
given her so much uneasiness. These enemies of Joseph had no sooner
taken possession of her mind than they insinuated to her a thousand
things in his disfavour; everything but dislike of her person; a thought
which, as it would have been intolerable to bear, she checked the moment
it endeavoured to arise. Revenge came now to her assistance; and she
considered her dismission of him, stript, and without a character, with
the utmost pleasure. She rioted in the several kinds of misery which her
imagination suggested to her might be his fate; and, with a smile
composed of anger, mirth, and scorn, viewed him in the rags in which her
fancy had drest him.

Mrs Slipslop, being summoned, attended her mistress, who had now in her
own opinion totally subdued this passion. Whilst she was dressing she
asked if that fellow had been turned away according to her orders.
Slipslop answered, she had told her ladyship so (as indeed she
had).--"And how did he behave?" replied the lady. "Truly, madam," cries
Slipslop, "in such a manner that infected everybody who saw him. The
poor lad had but little wages to receive; for he constantly allowed his
father and mother half his income; so that, when your ladyship's livery
was stript off, he had not wherewithal to buy a coat, and must have gone
naked if one of the footmen had not incommodated him with one; and
whilst he was standing in his shirt (and, to say truth, he was an
amorous figure), being told your ladyship would not give him a
character, he sighed, and said he had done nothing willingly to offend;
that for his part, he should always give your ladyship a good character
wherever he went; and he prayed God to bless you; for you was the best
of ladies, though his enemies had set you against him. I wish you had
not turned him away; for I believe you have not a faithfuller servant in
the house."--"How came you then," replied the lady, "to advise me to
turn him away?"--"I, madam!" said Slipslop; "I am sure you will do me
the justice to say, I did all in my power to prevent it; but I saw your
ladyship was angry; and it is not the business of us upper servants to
hinterfear on these occasions." "And was it not you, audacious wretch!"
cried the lady, "who made me angry? Was it not your tittle-tattle, in
which I believe you belyed the poor fellow, which incensed me against
him? He may thank you for all that hath happened; and so may I for the
loss of a good servant, and one who probably had more merit than all of
you. Poor fellow! I am charmed with his goodness to his parents. Why did
not you tell me of that, but suffer me to dismiss so good a creature
without a character? I see the reason of your whole behaviour now as
well as your complaint; you was jealous of the wenches." "I jealous!"
said Slipslop; "I assure you, I look upon myself as his betters; I am
not meat for a footman, I hope." These words threw the lady into a
violent passion, and she sent Slipslop from her presence, who departed,
tossing her nose, and crying, "Marry, come up! there are some people
more jealous than I, I believe." Her lady affected not to hear the
words, though in reality she did, and understood them too. Now ensued a
second conflict, so like the former, that it might savour of repetition
to relate it minutely. It may suffice to say that Lady Booby found good
reason to doubt whether she had so absolutely conquered her passion as
she had flattered herself; and, in order to accomplish it quite, took a
resolution, more common than wise, to retire immediately into the
country. The reader hath long ago seen the arrival of Mrs Slipslop, whom
no pertness could make her mistress resolve to part with; lately, that
of Mr Pounce, her forerunners; and, lastly, that of the lady herself.

The morning after her arrival being Sunday, she went to church, to the
great surprize of everybody, who wondered to see her ladyship, being no
very constant church-woman, there so suddenly upon her journey. Joseph
was likewise there; and I have heard it was remarked that she fixed her
eyes on him much more than on the parson; but this I believe to be only
a malicious rumour. When the prayers were ended Mr Adams stood up, and
with a loud voice pronounced, "I publish the banns of marriage between
Joseph Andrews and Frances Goodwill, both of this parish," &c. Whether
this had any effect on Lady Booby or no, who was then in her pew, which
the congregation could not see into, I could never discover: but
certain it is that in about a quarter of an hour she stood up, and
directed her eyes to that part of the church where the women sat, and
persisted in looking that way during the remainder of the sermon in so
scrutinizing a manner, and with so angry a countenance, that most of
the women were afraid she was offended at them. The moment she returned
home she sent for Slipslop into her chamber, and told her she wondered
what that impudent fellow Joseph did in that parish? Upon which
Slipslop gave her an account of her meeting Adams with him on the road,
and likewise the adventure with Fanny. At the relation of which the
lady often changed her countenance; and when she had heard all, she
ordered Mr Adams into her presence, to whom she behaved as the reader
will see in the next chapter.



CHAPTER II.

_A dialogue between Mr Abraham Adams and the Lady Booby._


Mr Adams was not far off, for he was drinking her ladyship's health
below in a cup of her ale. He no sooner came before her than she began
in the following manner: "I wonder, sir, after the many great
obligations you have had to this family" (with all which the reader hath
in the course of this history been minutely acquainted), "that you will
ungratefully show any respect to a fellow who hath been turned out of it
for his misdeeds. Nor doth it, I can tell you, sir, become a man of your
character, to run about the country with an idle fellow and wench.
Indeed, as for the girl, I know no harm of her. Slipslop tells me she
was formerly bred up in my house, and behaved as she ought, till she
hankered after this fellow, and he spoiled her. Nay, she may still,
perhaps, do very well, if he will let her alone. You are, therefore,
doing a monstrous thing in endeavouring to procure a match between these
two people, which will be to the ruin of them both."--"Madam," said
Adams, "if your ladyship will but hear me speak, I protest I never heard
any harm of Mr Joseph Andrews; if I had, I should have corrected him for
it; for I never have, nor will, encourage the faults of those under my
care. As for the young woman, I assure your ladyship I have as good an
opinion of her as your ladyship yourself or any other can have. She is
the sweetest-tempered, honestest, worthiest young creature; indeed, as
to her beauty, I do not commend her on that account, though all men
allow she is the handsomest woman, gentle or simple, that ever appeared
in the parish."--"You are very impertinent," says she, "to talk such
fulsome stuff to me. It is mighty becoming truly in a clergyman to
trouble himself about handsome women, and you are a delicate judge of
beauty, no doubt. A man who hath lived all his life in such a parish as
this is a rare judge of beauty! Ridiculous! beauty indeed! a country
wench a beauty! I shall be sick whenever I hear beauty mentioned again.
And so this wench is to stock the parish with beauties, I hope. But,
sir, our poor is numerous enough already; I will have no more vagabonds
settled here."--"Madam," says Adams, "your ladyship is offended with me,
I protest, without any reason. This couple were desirous to consummate
long ago, and I dissuaded them from it; nay, I may venture to say, I
believe I was the sole cause of their delaying it."--"Well," says she,
"and you did very wisely and honestly too, notwithstanding she is the
greatest beauty in the parish."--"And now, madam," continued he, "I only
perform my office to Mr Joseph."--"Pray, don't mister such fellows to
me," cries the lady. "He," said the parson, "with the consent of Fanny,
before my face, put in the banns." "Yes," answered the lady, "I suppose
the slut is forward enough; Slipslop tells me how her head runs upon
fellows; that is one of her beauties, I suppose. But if they have put in
the banns, I desire you will publish them no more without my
orders."--"Madam," cries Adams, "if any one puts in a sufficient
caution, and assigns a proper reason against them, I am willing to
surcease."--"I tell you a reason," says she: "he is a vagabond, and he
shall not settle here, and bring a nest of beggars into the parish; it
will make us but little amends that they will be beauties."--"Madam,"
answered Adams, "with the utmost submission to your ladyship, I have been
informed by lawyer Scout that any person who serves a year gains a
settlement in the parish where he serves."--"Lawyer Scout," replied the
lady, "is an impudent coxcomb; I will have no lawyer Scout interfere
with me. I repeat to you again, I will have no more incumbrances brought
on us: so I desire you will proceed no farther."--"Madam," returned
Adams, "I would obey your ladyship in everything that is lawful; but
surely the parties being poor is no reason against their marrying. God
forbid there should be any such law! The poor have little share enough
of this world already; it would be barbarous indeed to deny them the
common privileges and innocent enjoyments which nature indulges to the
animal creation."--"Since you understand yourself no better," cries the
lady, "nor the respect due from such as you to a woman of my
distinction, than to affront my ears by such loose discourse, I shall
mention but one short word; it is my orders to you that you publish
these banns no more; and if you dare, I will recommend it to your
master, the doctor, to discard you from his service. I will, sir,
notwithstanding your poor family; and then you and the greatest beauty
in the parish may go and beg together."--"Madam," answered Adams, "I
know not what your ladyship means by the terms master and service. I am
in the service of a Master who will never discard me for doing my duty;
and if the doctor (for indeed I have never been able to pay for a
licence) thinks proper to turn me from my cure, God will provide me, I
hope, another. At least, my family, as well as myself, have hands; and
he will prosper, I doubt not, our endeavours to get our bread honestly
with them. Whilst my conscience is pure, I shall never fear what man can
do unto me."--"I condemn my humility," said the lady, "for demeaning
myself to converse with you so long. I shall take other measures; for I
see you are a confederate with them. But the sooner you leave me the
better; and I shall give orders that my doors may no longer be open to
you. I will suffer no parsons who run about the country with beauties to
be entertained here."--"Madam," said Adams, "I shall enter into no
persons' doors against their will; but I am assured, when you have
enquired farther into this matter, you will applaud, not blame, my
proceeding; and so I humbly take my leave:" which he did with many bows,
or at least many attempts at a bow.



CHAPTER III.

_What passed between the lady and lawyer Scout._


In the afternoon the lady sent for Mr Scout, whom she attacked most
violently for intermeddling with her servants, which he denied, and
indeed with truth, for he had only asserted accidentally, and perhaps
rightly, that a year's service gained a settlement; and so far he owned
he might have formerly informed the parson and believed it was law. "I
am resolved," said the lady, "to have no discarded servants of mine
settled here; and so, if this be your law, I shall send to another
lawyer." Scout said, "If she sent to a hundred lawyers, not one or all
of them could alter the law. The utmost that was in the power of a
lawyer was to prevent the law's taking effect; and that he himself could
do for her ladyship as well as any other; and I believe," says he,
"madam, your ladyship, not being conversant in these matters, hath
mistaken a difference; for I asserted only that a man who served a year
was settled. Now there is a material difference between being settled in
law and settled in fact; and as I affirmed generally he was settled, and
law is preferable to fact, my settlement must be understood in law and
not in fact. And suppose, madam, we admit he was settled in law, what
use will they make of it? how doth that relate to fact? He is not
settled in fact; and if he be not settled in fact, he is not an
inhabitant; and if he is not an inhabitant, he is not of this parish;
and then undoubtedly he ought not to be published here; for Mr Adams
hath told me your ladyship's pleasure, and the reason, which is a very
good one, to prevent burdening us with the poor; we have too many
already, and I think we ought to have an act to hang or transport half
of them. If we can prove in evidence that he is not settled in fact, it
is another matter. What I said to Mr Adams was on a supposition that he
was settled in fact; and indeed, if that was the case, I should
doubt."--"Don't tell me your facts and your ifs," said the lady; "I
don't understand your gibberish; you take too much upon you, and are
very impertinent, in pretending to direct in this parish; and you shall
be taught better, I assure you, you shall. But as to the wench, I am
resolved she shall not settle here; I will not suffer such beauties as
these to produce children for us to keep."--"Beauties, indeed! your
ladyship is pleased to be merry," answered Scout.--"Mr Adams described
her so to me," said the lady. "Pray, what sort of dowdy is it, Mr
Scout?"--"The ugliest creature almost I ever beheld; a poor dirty drab,
your ladyship never saw such a wretch."--"Well, but, dear Mr Scout, let
her be what she will, these ugly women will bring children, you know; so
that we must prevent the marriage."--"True, madam," replied Scout, "for
the subsequent marriage co-operating with the law will carry law into
fact. When a man is married he is settled in fact, and then he is not
removable. I will see Mr Adams, and I make no doubt of prevailing with
him. His only objection is, doubtless, that he shall lose his fee; but
that being once made easy, as it shall be, I am confident no farther
objection will remain. No, no, it is impossible; but your ladyship can't
discommend his unwillingness to depart from his fee. Every man ought to
have a proper value for his fee. As to the matter in question, if your
ladyship pleases to employ me in it, I will venture to promise you
success. The laws of this land are not so vulgar to permit a mean fellow
to contend with one of your ladyship's fortune. We have one sure card,
which is, to carry him before Justice Frolick, who, upon hearing your
ladyship's name, will commit him without any farther questions. As for
the dirty slut, we shall have nothing to do with her; for, if we get rid
of the fellow, the ugly jade will--"--"Take what measures you please,
good Mr Scout," answered the lady: "but I wish you could rid the parish
of both; for Slipslop tells me such stories of this wench, that I abhor
the thoughts of her; and, though you say she is such an ugly slut, yet
you know, dear Mr Scout, these forward creatures, who run after men,
will always find some as forward as themselves; so that, to prevent the
increase of beggars, we must get rid of her."--"Your ladyship is very
much in the right," answered Scout; "but I am afraid the law is a little
deficient in giving us any such power of prevention; however, the
justice will stretch it as far as he is able, to oblige your ladyship.
To say truth, it is a great blessing to the country that he is in the
commission, for he hath taken several poor off our hands that the law
would never lay hold on. I know some justices who think as much of
committing a man to Bridewell as his lordship at 'size would of hanging
him; but it would do a man good to see his worship, our justice, commit
a fellow to Bridewell, he takes so much pleasure in it; and when once we
ha'um there, we seldom hear any more o'um. He's either starved or eat up
by vermin in a month's time."--Here the arrival of a visitor put an end
to the conversation, and Mr Scout, having undertaken the cause and
promised it success, departed.

This Scout was one of those fellows who, without any knowledge of the
law, or being bred to it, take upon them, in defiance of an act of
Parliament, to act as lawyers in the country, and are called so. They
are the pests of society, and a scandal to a profession, to which indeed
they do not belong, and which owes to such kind of rascallions the
ill-will which weak persons bear towards it. With this fellow, to whom a
little before she would not have condescended to have spoken, did a
certain passion for Joseph, and the jealousy and the disdain of poor
innocent Fanny, betray the Lady Booby into a familiar discourse, in
which she inadvertently confirmed many hints with which Slipslop, whose
gallant he was, had pre-acquainted him; and whence he had taken an
opportunity to assert those severe falsehoods of little Fanny which
possibly the reader might not have been well able to account for if we
had not thought proper to give him this information.



CHAPTER IV.

_A short chapter, but very full of matter; particularly the arrival of
Mr Booby and his lady._


All that night, and the next day, the Lady Booby past with the utmost
anxiety; her mind was distracted and her soul tossed up and down by many
turbulent and opposite passions. She loved, hated, pitied, scorned,
admired, despised the same person by fits, which changed in a very short
interval. On Tuesday morning, which happened to be a holiday, she went
to church, where, to her surprize, Mr Adams published the banns again
with as audible a voice as before. It was lucky for her that, as there
was no sermon, she had an immediate opportunity of returning home to
vent her rage, which she could not have concealed from the congregation
five minutes; indeed, it was not then very numerous, the assembly
consisting of no more than Adams, his clerk, his wife, the lady, and one
of her servants. At her return she met Slipslop, who accosted her in
these words:--"O meam, what doth your ladyship think? To be sure, lawyer
Scout hath carried Joseph and Fanny both before the justice. All the
parish are in tears, and say they will certainly be hanged; for nobody
knows what it is for"--"I suppose they deserve it," says the lady.
"What! dost thou mention such wretches to me?"--"O dear madam," answered
Slipslop, "is it not a pity such a graceless young man should die a
virulent death? I hope the judge will take commensuration on his youth.
As for Fanny, I don't think it signifies much what becomes of her; and
if poor Joseph hath done anything, I could venture to swear she traduced
him to it: few men ever come to a fragrant punishment, but by those
nasty creatures, who are a scandal to our sect." The lady was no more
pleased at this news, after a moment's reflection, than Slipslop
herself; for, though she wished Fanny far enough, she did not desire the
removal of Joseph, especially with her. She was puzzled how to act or
what to say on this occasion, when a coach and six drove into the court,
and a servant acquainted her with the arrival of her nephew Booby and
his lady. She ordered them to be conducted into a drawing-room, whither
she presently repaired, having composed her countenance as well as she
could, and being a little satisfied that the wedding would by these
means be at least interrupted, and that she should have an opportunity
to execute any resolution she might take, for which she saw herself
provided with an excellent instrument in Scout.

The Lady Booby apprehended her servant had made a mistake when he
mentioned Mr Booby's lady; for she had never heard of his marriage: but
how great was her surprize when, at her entering the room, her nephew
presented his wife to her; saying, "Madam, this is that charming Pamela,
of whom I am convinced you have heard so much." The lady received her
with more civility than he expected; indeed with the utmost; for she was
perfectly polite, nor had any vice inconsistent with good-breeding. They
past some little time in ordinary discourse, when a servant came and
whispered Mr Booby, who presently told the ladies he must desert them a
little on some business of consequence; and, as their discourse during
his absence would afford little improvement or entertainment to the
reader, we will leave them for a while to attend Mr Booby.



CHAPTER V.

_Containing justice business; curious precedents of depositions, and
other matters necessary to be perused by all justices of the peace and
their clerks._


The young squire and his lady were no sooner alighted from their coach
than the servants began to inquire after Mr Joseph, from whom they said
their lady had not heard a word, to her great surprize, since he had
left Lady Booby's. Upon this they were instantly informed of what had
lately happened, with which they hastily acquainted their master, who
took an immediate resolution to go himself, and endeavour to restore his
Pamela her brother, before she even knew she had lost him.

The justice before whom the criminals were carried, and who lived within
a short mile of the lady's house, was luckily Mr Booby's acquaintance,
by his having an estate in his neighbourhood. Ordering therefore his
horses to his coach, he set out for the judgment-seat, and arrived when
the justice had almost finished his business. He was conducted into a
hall, where he was acquainted that his worship would wait on him in a
moment; for he had only a man and a woman to commit to Bridewell first.
As he was now convinced he had not a minute to lose, he insisted on the
servant's introducing him directly into the room where the justice was
then executing his office, as he called it. Being brought thither, and
the first compliments being passed between the squire and his worship,
the former asked the latter what crime those two young people had been
guilty of? "No great crime," answered the justice; "I have only ordered
them to Bridewell for a month." "But what is their crime?" repeated the
squire. "Larceny, an't please your honour," said Scout. "Ay," says the
justice, "a kind of felonious larcenous thing. I believe I must order
them a little correction too, a little stripping and whipping." (Poor
Fanny, who had hitherto supported all with the thoughts of Joseph's
company, trembled at that sound; but, indeed, without reason, for none
but the devil himself would have executed such a sentence on her.)
"Still," said the squire, "I am ignorant of the crime--the fact I mean."
"Why, there it is in peaper," answered the justice, showing him a
deposition which, in the absence of his clerk, he had writ himself, of
which we have with great difficulty procured an authentic copy; and here
it follows _verbatim et literatim:_--

    _The depusition of James Scout, layer, and Thomas Trotter,
    yeoman, taken before mee, one of his magesty's justasses of the
    piece for Zumersetshire._

    "These deponants saith, and first Thomas Trotter for himself
    saith, that on the -- of this instant October, being
    Sabbath-day, betwin the ours of 2 and 4 in the afternoon, he
    zeed Joseph Andrews and Francis Goodwill walk akross a certane
    felde belunging to layer Scout, and out of the path which ledes
    thru the said felde, and there he zede Joseph Andrews with a
    nife cut one hassel twig, of the value, as he believes, of
    three half-pence, or thereabouts; and he saith that the said
    Francis Goodwill was likewise walking on the grass out of the
    said path in the said felde, and did receive and karry in her
    hand the said twig, and so was cumfarting, eading, and abatting
    to the said Joseph therein. And the said James Scout for
    himself says that he verily believes the said twig to be his
    own proper twig," &c.

"Jesu!" said the squire, "would you commit two persons to Bridewell for
a twig?" "Yes," said the lawyer, "and with great lenity too; for if we
had called it a young tree, they would have been both hanged." "Harkee,"
says the justice, taking aside the squire; "I should not have been so
severe on this occasion, but Lady Booby desires to get them out of the
parish; so lawyer Scout will give the constable orders to let them run
away, if they please: but it seems they intend to marry together, and
the lady hath no other means, as they are legally settled there, to
prevent their bringing an incumbrance on her own parish." "Well," said
the squire, "I will take care my aunt shall be satisfied in this point;
and likewise I promise you, Joseph here shall never be any incumbrance
on her. I shall be obliged to you, therefore, if, instead of Bridewell,
you will commit them to my custody." "O! to be sure, sir, if you desire
it," answered the justice; and without more ado Joseph and Fanny were
delivered over to Squire Booby, whom Joseph very well knew, but little
guessed how nearly he was related to him. The justice burnt his
mittimus, the constable was sent about his business, the lawyer made no
complaint for want of justice; and the prisoners, with exulting hearts,
gave a thousand thanks to his honour Mr Booby; who did not intend their
obligations to him should cease here; for, ordering his man to produce a
cloak-bag, which he had caused to be brought from Lady Booby's on
purpose, he desired the justice that he might have Joseph with him into
a room; where, ordering his servant to take out a suit of his own
clothes, with linnen and other necessaries, he left Joseph to dress
himself, who, not yet knowing the cause of all this civility, excused
his accepting such a favour as long as decently he could. Whilst Joseph
was dressing, the squire repaired to the justice, whom he found talking
with Fanny; for, during the examination, she had flopped her hat over
her eyes, which were also bathed in tears, and had by that means
concealed from his worship what might perhaps have rendered the arrival
of Mr Booby unnecessary, at least for herself. The justice no sooner saw
her countenance cleared up, and her bright eyes shining through her
tears, than he secretly cursed himself for having once thought of
Bridewell for her. He would willingly have sent his own wife thither, to
have had Fanny in her place. And, conceiving almost at the same instant
desires and schemes to accomplish them, he employed the minutes whilst
the squire was absent with Joseph in assuring her how sorry he was for
having treated her so roughly before he knew her merit; and told her,
that since Lady Booby was unwilling that she should settle in her
parish, she was heartily welcome to his, where he promised her his
protection, adding that he would take Joseph and her into his own
family, if she liked it; which assurance he confirmed with a squeeze by
the hand. She thanked him very kindly, and said, "She would acquaint
Joseph with the offer, which he would certainly be glad to accept; for
that Lady Booby was angry with them both; though she did not know either
had done anything to offend her, but imputed it to Madam Slipslop, who
had always been her enemy."

The squire now returned, and prevented any farther continuance of this
conversation; and the justice, out of a pretended respect to his guest,
but in reality from an apprehension of a rival (for he knew nothing of
his marriage), ordered Fanny into the kitchen, whither she gladly
retired; nor did the squire, who declined the trouble of explaining the
whole matter, oppose it.

It would be unnecessary, if I was able, which indeed I am not, to
relate the conversation between these two gentlemen, which rolled, as
I have been informed, entirely on the subject of horse-racing. Joseph
was soon drest in the plainest dress he could find, which was a blue
coat and breeches, with a gold edging, and a red waistcoat with the
same: and as this suit, which was rather too large for the squire,
exactly fitted him, so he became it so well, and looked so genteel,
that no person would have doubted its being as well adapted to his
quality as his shape; nor have suspected, as one might, when my Lord
----, or Sir ----, or Mr ----, appear in lace or embroidery, that the
taylor's man wore those clothes home on his back which he should have
carried under his arm.

The squire now took leave of the justice; and, calling for Fanny, made
her and Joseph, against their wills, get into the coach with him, which
he then ordered to drive to Lady Booby's. It had moved a few yards only,
when the squire asked Joseph if he knew who that man was crossing the
field; for, added he, I never saw one take such strides before. Joseph
answered eagerly, "O, sir, it is parson Adams!" "O la, indeed, and so it
is," said Fanny; "poor man, he is coming to do what he could for us.
Well, he is the worthiest, best-natured creature."--"Ay," said Joseph;
"God bless him! for there is not such another in the universe." "The
best creature living sure," cries Fanny. "Is he?" says the squire; "then
I am resolved to have the best creature living in my coach;" and so
saying, he ordered it to stop, whilst Joseph, at his request, hallowed
to the parson, who, well knowing his voice, made all the haste
imaginable, and soon came up with them. He was desired by the master,
who could scarce refrain from laughter at his figure, to mount into the
coach, which he with many thanks refused, saying he could walk by its
side, and he'd warrant he kept up with it; but he was at length
over-prevailed on. The squire now acquainted Joseph with his marriage;
but he might have spared himself that labour; for his servant, whilst
Joseph was dressing, had performed that office before. He continued to
express the vast happiness he enjoyed in his sister, and the value he
had for all who belonged to her. Joseph made many bows, and exprest as
many acknowledgments: and parson Adams, who now first perceived Joseph's
new apparel, burst into tears with joy, and fell to rubbing his hands
and snapping his fingers as if he had been mad.

They were now arrived at the Lady Booby's, and the squire, desiring them
to wait a moment in the court, walked in to his aunt, and calling her
out from his wife, acquainted her with Joseph's arrival; saying, "Madam,
as I have married a virtuous and worthy woman, I am resolved to own her
relations, and show them all a proper respect; I shall think myself
therefore infinitely obliged to all mine who will do the same. It is
true, her brother hath been your servant, but he is now become my
brother; and I have one happiness, that neither his character, his
behaviour, or appearance, give me any reason to be ashamed of calling
him so. In short, he is now below, dressed like a gentleman, in which
light I intend he shall hereafter be seen; and you will oblige me beyond
expression if you will admit him to be of our party; for I know it will
give great pleasure to my wife, though she will not mention it."

This was a stroke of fortune beyond the Lady Booby's hopes or
expectation; she answered him eagerly, "Nephew, you know how easily I am
prevailed on to do anything which Joseph Andrews desires--Phoo, I mean
which you desire me; and, as he is now your relation, I cannot refuse to
entertain him as such." The squire told her he knew his obligation to
her for her compliance; and going three steps, returned and told her--he
had one more favour, which he believed she would easily grant, as she
had accorded him the former. "There is a young woman--"--"Nephew," says
she, "don't let my good-nature make you desire, as is too commonly the
case, to impose on me. Nor think, because I have with so much
condescension agreed to suffer your brother-in-law to come to my table,
that I will submit to the company of all my own servants, and all the
dirty trollops in the country." "Madam," answered the squire, "I believe
you never saw this young creature. I never beheld such sweetness and
innocence joined with such beauty, and withal so genteel." "Upon my soul
I won't admit her," replied the lady in a passion; "the whole world
shan't prevail on me; I resent even the desire as an affront, and--" The
squire, who knew her inflexibility, interrupted her, by asking pardon,
and promising not to mention it more. He then returned to Joseph, and
she to Pamela. He took Joseph aside, and told him he would carry him to
his sister, but could not prevail as yet for Fanny. Joseph begged that
he might see his sister alone, and then be with his Fanny; but the
squire, knowing the pleasure his wife would have in her brother's
company, would not admit it, telling Joseph there would be nothing in so
short an absence from Fanny, whilst he was assured of her safety;
adding, he hoped he could not so easily quit a sister whom he had not
seen so long, and who so tenderly loved him. Joseph immediately
complied; for indeed no brother could love a sister more; and,
recommending Fanny, who rejoiced that she was not to go before Lady
Booby, to the care of Mr Adams, he attended the squire upstairs, whilst
Fanny repaired with the parson to his house, where she thought herself
secure of a kind reception.



CHAPTER VI.

_Of which you are desired to read no more than you like._


The meeting between Joseph and Pamela was not without tears of joy on
both sides; and their embraces were full of tenderness and affection.
They were, however, regarded with much more pleasure by the nephew than
by the aunt, to whose flame they were fuel only; and this was increased
by the addition of dress, which was indeed not wanted to set off the
lively colours in which Nature had drawn health, strength, comeliness,
and youth. In the afternoon Joseph, at their request, entertained them
with an account of his adventures: nor could Lady Booby conceal her
dissatisfaction at those parts in which Fanny was concerned, especially
when Mr Booby launched forth into such rapturous praises of her beauty.
She said, applying to her niece, that she wondered her nephew, who had
pretended to marry for love, should think such a subject proper to
amuse his wife with; adding, that, for her part, she should be jealous
of a husband who spoke so warmly in praise of another woman. Pamela
answered, indeed, she thought she had cause; but it was an instance of
Mr Booby's aptness to see more beauty in women than they were
mistresses of. At which words both the women fixed their eyes on two
looking-glasses; and Lady Booby replied, that men were, in the general,
very ill judges of beauty; and then, whilst both contemplated only
their own faces, they paid a cross compliment to each other's charms.
When the hour of rest approached, which the lady of the house deferred
as long as decently she could, she informed Joseph (whom for the future
we shall call Mr Joseph, he having as good a title to that appellation
as many others--I mean that incontested one of good clothes) that she
had ordered a bed to be provided for him. He declined this favour to
his utmost; for his heart had long been with his Fanny; but she
insisted on his accepting it, alledging that the parish had no proper
accommodation for such a person as he was now to esteem himself. The
squire and his lady both joining with her, Mr Joseph was at last forced
to give over his design of visiting Fanny that evening; who, on her
side, as impatiently expected him till midnight, when, in complacence
to Mr Adams's family, who had sat up two hours out of respect to her,
she retired to bed, but not to sleep; the thoughts of her love kept her
waking, and his not returning according to his promise filled her with
uneasiness; of which, however, she could not assign any other cause
than merely that of being absent from him.

Mr Joseph rose early in the morning, and visited her in whom his soul
delighted. She no soonerl
gypsies, and had been kept by them during a whole year, when, looking on
him as in a dying condition, they had exchanged him for the other
healthier child, in the manner before related. He said, As to the name
of his father, his wife had either never known or forgot it; but that
she had acquainted him he lived about forty miles from the place where
the exchange had been made, and which way, promising to spare no pains
in endeavouring with him to discover the place.

But Fortune, which seldom doth good or ill, or makes men happy or
miserable, by halves, resolved to spare him this labour. The reader may
please to recollect that Mr Wilson had intended a journey to the west,
in which he was to pass through Mr Adams's parish, and had promised to
call on him. He was now arrived at the Lady Booby's gates for that
purpose, being directed thither from the parson's house, and had sent in
the servant whom we have above seen call Mr Adams forth. This had no
sooner mentioned the discovery of a stolen child, and had uttered the
word strawberry, than Mr Wilson, with wildness in his looks, and the
utmost eagerness in his words, begged to be shewed into the room, where
he entered without the least regard to any of the company but Joseph,
and, embracing him with a complexion all pale and trembling, desired to
see the mark on his breast; the parson followed him capering, rubbing
his hands, and crying out, _Hic est quem quaeris; inventus est, &c_.
Joseph complied with the request of Mr Wilson, who no sooner saw the
mark than, abandoning himself to the most extravagant rapture of
passion, he embraced Joseph with inexpressible ecstasy, and cried out in
tears of joy, "I have discovered my son, I have him again in my arms!"
Joseph was not sufficiently apprized yet to taste the same delight with
his father (for so in reality he was); however, he returned some warmth
to his embraces: but he no sooner perceived, from his father's account,
the agreement of every circumstance, of person, time, and place, than he
threw himself at his feet, and, embracing his knees, with tears begged
his blessing, which was given with much affection, and received with
such respect, mixed with such tenderness on both sides, that it affected
all present; but none so much as Lady Booby, who left the room in an
agony, which was but too much perceived, and not very charitably
accounted for by some of the company.



CHAPTER XVI.

_Being the last in which this true history is brought to a happy
conclusion._


Fanny was very little behind her Joseph in the duty she exprest towards
her parents, and the joy she evidenced in discovering them. Gammar
Andrews kissed her, and said, She was heartily glad to see her; but for
her part, she could never love any one better than Joseph. Gaffar
Andrews testified no remarkable emotion: he blessed and kissed her, but
complained bitterly that he wanted his pipe, not having had a whiff
that morning.

Mr Booby, who knew nothing of his aunt's fondness, imputed her abrupt
departure to her pride, and disdain of the family into which he was
married; he was therefore desirous to be gone with the utmost celerity;
and now, having congratulated Mr Wilson and Joseph on the discovery, he
saluted Fanny, called her sister, and introduced her as such to Pamela,
who behaved with great decency on the occasion.

He now sent a message to his aunt, who returned that she wished him a
good journey, but was too disordered to see any company: he therefore
prepared to set out, having invited Mr Wilson to his house; and Pamela
and Joseph both so insisted on his complying, that he at last
consented, having first obtained a messenger from Mr Booby to acquaint
his wife with the news; which, as he knew it would render her
completely happy, he could not prevail on himself to delay a moment in
acquainting her with.

The company were ranged in this manner: the two old people, with their
two daughters, rode in the coach; the squire, Mr Wilson, Joseph, parson
Adams, and the pedlar, proceeded on horseback.

In their way, Joseph informed his father of his intended match with
Fanny; to which, though he expressed some reluctance at first, on the
eagerness of his son's instances he consented; saying, if she was so
good a creature as she appeared, and he described her, he thought the
disadvantages of birth and fortune might be compensated. He however
insisted on the match being deferred till he had seen his mother; in
which, Joseph perceiving him positive, with great duty obeyed him, to
the great delight of parson Adams, who by these means saw an
opportunity of fulfilling the Church forms, and marrying his
parishioners without a licence.

Mr Adams, greatly exulting on this occasion (for such ceremonies were
matters of no small moment with him), accidentally gave spurs to his
horse, which the generous beast disdaining--for he was of high mettle,
and had been used to more expert riders than the gentleman who at
present bestrode him, for whose horsemanship he had perhaps some
contempt--immediately ran away full speed, and played so many antic
tricks that he tumbled the parson from his back; which Joseph
perceiving, came to his relief.

This accident afforded infinite merriment to the servants, and no less
frighted poor Fanny, who beheld him as he passed by the coach; but the
mirth of the one and terror of the other were soon determined, when the
parson declared he had received no damage.

The horse having freed himself from his unworthy rider, as he probably
thought him, proceeded to make the best of his way; but was stopped by a
gentleman and his servants, who were travelling the opposite way, and
were now at a little distance from the coach. They soon met; and as one
of the servants delivered Adams his horse, his master hailed him, and
Adams, looking up, presently recollected he was the justice of peace
before whom he and Fanny had made their appearance. The parson presently
saluted him very kindly; and the justice informed him that he had found
the fellow who attempted to swear against him and the young woman the
very next day, and had committed him to Salisbury gaol, where he was
charged with many robberies.

Many compliments having passed between the parson and the justice, the
latter proceeded on his journey; and the former, having with some
disdain refused Joseph's offer of changing horses, and declared he was
as able a horseman as any in the kingdom, remounted his beast; and now
the company again proceeded, and happily arrived at their journey's
end, Mr Adams, by good luck, rather than by good riding, escaping a
second fall.

The company, arriving at Mr Booby's house, were all received by him in
the most courteous and entertained in the most splendid manner, after
the custom of the old English hospitality, which is still preserved in
some very few families in the remote parts of England. They all passed
that day with the utmost satisfaction; it being perhaps impossible to
find any set of people more solidly and sincerely happy. Joseph and
Fanny found means to be alone upwards of two hours, which were the
shortest but the sweetest imaginable.

In the morning Mr Wilson proposed to his son to make a visit with him to
his mother; which, notwithstanding his dutiful inclinations, and a
longing desire he had to see her, a little concerned him, as he must be
obliged to leave his Fanny; but the goodness of Mr Booby relieved him;
for he proposed to send his own coach and six for Mrs Wilson, whom
Pamela so very earnestly invited, that Mr Wilson at length agreed with
the entreaties of Mr Booby and Joseph, and suffered the coach to go
empty for his wife.

On Saturday night the coach returned with Mrs Wilson, who added one more
to this happy assembly. The reader may imagine much better and quicker
too than I can describe the many embraces and tears of joy which
succeeded her arrival. It is sufficient to say she was easily prevailed
with to follow her husband's example in consenting to the match.

On Sunday Mr Adams performed the service at the squire's parish church,
the curate of which very kindly exchanged duty, and rode twenty miles to
the Lady Booby's parish so to do; being particularly charged not to omit
publishing the banns, being the third and last time.

At length the happy day arrived which was to put Joseph in the
possession of all his wishes. He arose, and drest himself in a neat but
plain suit of Mr Booby's, which exactly fitted him; for he refused all
finery; as did Fanny likewise, who could be prevailed on by Pamela to
attire herself in nothing richer than a white dimity nightgown. Her
shift indeed, which Pamela presented her, was of the finest kind, and
had an edging of lace round the bosom. She likewise equipped her with a
pair of fine white thread stockings, which were all she would accept;
for she wore one of her own short round-eared caps, and over it a
little straw hat, lined with cherry-coloured silk, and tied with a
cherry-coloured ribbon. In this dress she came forth from her chamber,
blushing and breathing sweets; and was by Joseph, whose eyes sparkled
fire, led to church, the whole family attending, where Mr Adams
performed the ceremony; at which nothing was so remarkable as the
extraordinary and unaffected modesty of Fanny, unless the true
Christian piety of Adams, who publickly rebuked Mr Booby and Pamela for
laughing in so sacred a place, and on so solemn an occasion. Our parson
would have done no less to the highest prince on earth; for, though he
paid all submission and deference to his superiors in other matters,
where the least spice of religion intervened he immediately lost all
respect of persons. It was his maxim, that he was a servant of the
Highest, and could not, without departing from his duty, give up the
least article of his honour or of his cause to the greatest earthly
potentate. Indeed, he always asserted that Mr Adams at church with his
surplice on, and Mr Adams without that ornament in any other place,
were two very different persons.

When the church rites were over Joseph led his blooming bride back to Mr
Booby's (for the distance was so very little they did not think proper
to use a coach); the whole company attended them likewise on foot; and
now a most magnificent entertainment was provided, at which parson Adams
demonstrated an appetite surprizing as well as surpassing every one
present. Indeed the only persons who betrayed any deficiency on this
occasion were those on whose account the feast was provided. They
pampered their imaginations with the much more exquisite repast which
the approach of night promised them; the thoughts of which filled both
their minds, though with different sensations; the one all desire, while
the other had her wishes tempered with fears.

At length, after a day passed with the utmost merriment, corrected by
the strictest decency, in which, however, parson Adams, being well
filled with ale and pudding, had given a loose to more facetiousness
than was usual to him, the happy, the blest moment arrived when Fanny
retired with her mother, her mother-in-law, and her sister.

She was soon undrest; for she had no jewels to deposit in their caskets,
nor fine laces to fold with the nicest exactness. Undressing to her was
properly discovering, not putting off, ornaments; for, as all her charms
were the gifts of nature, she could divest herself of none. How, reader,
shall I give thee an adequate idea of this lovely young creature? the
bloom of roses and lilies might a little illustrate her complexion, or
their smell her sweetness; but to comprehend her entirely, conceive
youth, health, bloom, neatness, and innocence, in her bridal bed;
conceive all these in their utmost perfection, and you may place the
charming Fanny's picture before your eyes.

Joseph no sooner heard she was in bed than he fled with the utmost
eagerness to her. A minute carried him into her arms, where we shall
leave this happy couple to enjoy the private rewards of their constancy;
rewards so great and sweet, that I apprehend Joseph neither envied the
noblest duke, nor Fanny the finest duchess, that night.

The third day Mr Wilson and his wife, with their son and daughter,
returned home; where they now live together in a state of bliss scarce
ever equalled. Mr Booby hath, with unprecedented generosity, given Fanny
a fortune of two thousand pounds, which Joseph hath laid out in a little
estate in the same parish with his father, which he now occupies (his
father having stocked it for him); and Fanny presides with most
excellent management in his dairy; where, however, she is not at present
very able to bustle much, being, as Mr Wilson informs me in his last
letter, extremely big with her first child.

Mr Booby hath presented Mr Adams with a living of one hundred and
thirty pounds a year. He at first refused it, resolving not to quit
his parishioners, with whom he had lived so long; but, on
recollecting he might keep a curate at this living, he hath been
lately inducted into it.

The pedlar, besides several handsome presents, both from Mr Wilson and
Mr Booby, is, by the latter's interest, made an exciseman; a trust which
he discharges with such justice, that he is greatly beloved in his
neighbourhood.

As for the Lady Booby, she returned to London in a few days, where a
young captain of dragoons, together with eternal parties at cards, soon
obliterated the memory of Joseph.

Joseph remains blest with his Fanny, whom he doats on with the utmost
tenderness, which is all returned on her side. The happiness of this
couple is a perpetual fountain of pleasure to their fond parents; and,
what is particularly remarkable, he declares he will imitate them in
their retirement, nor will be prevailed on by any booksellers, or their
authors, to make his appearance in high life.



THE END.
of her affection, with its pernicious consequences;
she therefore applied herself again to the bell, and re-summoned Mrs.
Slipslop into her presence; who again returned, and was told by her
mistress that she had considered better of the matter, and was
absolutely resolved to turn away Joseph; which she ordered her to do
immediately. Slipslop, who knew the violence of her lady's temper, and
would not venture her place for any Adonis or Hercules in the universe,
left her a third time; which she had no sooner done, than the little god
Cupid, fearing he had not yet done the lady's business, took a fresh
arrow with the sharpest point out of his quiver, and shot it directly
into her heart; in other and plainer language, the lady's passion got
the better of her reason. She called back Slipslop once more, and told
her she had resolved to see the boy, and examine him herself; therefore
bid her send him up. This wavering in her mistress's temper probably put
something into the waiting-gentlewoman's head not necessary to mention
to the sagacious reader.

Lady Booby was going to call her back again, but could not prevail with
herself. The next consideration therefore was, how she should behave to
Joseph when he came in. She resolved to preserve all the dignity of the
woman of fashion to her servant, and to indulge herself in this last
view of Joseph (for that she was most certainly resolved it should be)
at his own expense, by first insulting and then discarding him.

O Love, what monstrous tricks dost thou play with thy votaries of both
sexes! How dost thou deceive them, and make them deceive themselves!
Their follies are thy delight! Their sighs make thee laugh, and their
pangs are thy merriment!

Not the great Rich, who turns men into monkeys, wheel-barrows, and
whatever else best humours his fancy, hath so strangely metamorphosed
the human shape; nor the great Cibber, who confounds all number, gender,
and breaks through every rule of grammar at his will, hath so distorted
the English language as thou dost metamorphose and distort the
human senses.

Thou puttest out our eyes, stoppest up our ears, and takest away the
power of our nostrils; so that we can neither see the largest object,
hear the loudest noise, nor smell the most poignant perfume. Again, when
thou pleasest, thou canst make a molehill appear as a mountain, a
Jew's-harp sound like a trumpet, and a daisy smell like a violet. Thou
canst make cowardice brave, avarice generous, pride humble, and cruelty
tender-hearted. In short, thou turnest the heart of man inside out, as a
juggler doth a petticoat, and bringest whatsoever pleaseth thee out
from it. If there be any one who doubts all this, let him read the
next chapter.



CHAPTER VIII.

_In which, after some very fine writing, the history goes on, and
relates the interview between the lady and Joseph; where the latter hath
set an example which we despair of seeing followed by his sex in this
vicious age._


Now the rake Hesperus had called for his breeches, and, having well
rubbed his drowsy eyes, prepared to dress himself for all night; by
whose example his brother rakes on earth likewise leave those beds in
which they had slept away the day. Now Thetis, the good housewife, began
to put on the pot, in order to regale the good man Phoebus after his
daily labours were over. In vulgar language, it was in the evening when
Joseph attended his lady's orders.

But as it becomes us to preserve the character of this lady, who is the
heroine of our tale; and as we have naturally a wonderful tenderness for
that beautiful part of the human species called the fair sex; before we
discover too much of her frailty to our reader, it will be proper to
give him a lively idea of the vast temptation, which overcame all the
efforts of a modest and virtuous mind; and then we humbly hope his good
nature will rather pity than condemn the imperfection of human virtue.

[Illustration]

Nay, the ladies themselves will, we hope, be induced, by considering the
uncommon variety of charms which united in this young man's person, to
bridle their rampant passion for chastity, and be at least as mild as
their violent modesty and virtue will permit them, in censuring the
conduct of a woman who, perhaps, was in her own disposition as chaste
as those pure and sanctified virgins who, after a life innocently spent
in the gaieties of the town, begin about fifty to attend twice _per
diem_ at the polite churches and chapels, to return thanks for the grace
which preserved them formerly amongst beaus from temptations perhaps
less powerful than what now attacked the Lady Booby.

Mr Joseph Andrews was now in the one-and-twentieth year of his age. He
was of the highest degree of middle stature; his limbs were put together
with great elegance, and no less strength; his legs and thighs were
formed in the exactest proportion; his shoulders were broad and brawny,
but yet his arm hung so easily, that he had all the symptoms of strength
without the least clumsiness. His hair was of a nut-brown colour, and
was displayed in wanton ringlets down his back; his forehead was high,
his eyes dark, and as full of sweetness as of fire; his nose a little
inclined to the Roman; his teeth white and even; his lips full, red, and
soft; his beard was only rough on his chin and upper lip; but his
cheeks, in which his blood glowed, were overspread with a thick down;
his countenance had a tenderness joined with a sensibility
inexpressible. Add to this the most perfect neatness in his dress, and
an air which, to those who have not seen many noblemen, would give an
idea of nobility.

Such was the person who now appeared before the lady. She viewed him
some time in silence, and twice or thrice before she spake changed her
mind as to the manner in which she should begin. At length she said to
him, "Joseph, I am sorry to hear such complaints against you: I am told
you behave so rudely to the maids, that they cannot do their business in
quiet; I mean those who are not wicked enough to hearken to your
solicitations. As to others, they may, perhaps, not call you rude; for
there are wicked sluts who make one ashamed of one's own sex, and are as
ready to admit any nauseous familiarity as fellows to offer it: nay,
there are such in my family, but they shall not stay in it; that
impudent trollop who is with child by you is discharged by this time."

As a person who is struck through the heart with a thunderbolt looks
extremely surprised, nay, and perhaps is so too--thus the poor Joseph
received the false accusation of his mistress; he blushed and looked
confounded, which she misinterpreted to be symptoms of his guilt, and
thus went on:--

"Come hither, Joseph: another mistress might discard you for these
offences; but I have a compassion for your youth, and if I could be
certain you would be no more guilty--Consider, child," laying her hand
carelessly upon his, "you are a handsome young fellow, and might do
better; you might make your fortune." "Madam," said Joseph, "I do assure
your ladyship I don't know whether any maid in the house is man or
woman." "Oh fie! Joseph," answered the lady, "don't commit another crime
in denying the truth. I could pardon the first; but I hate a lyar."
"Madam," cries Joseph, "I hope your ladyship will not be offended at my
asserting my innocence; for, by all that is sacred, I have never offered
more than kissing." "Kissing!" said the lady, with great discomposure of
countenance, and more redness in her cheeks than anger in her eyes; "do
you call that no crime? Kissing, Joseph, is as a prologue to a play. Can
I believe a young fellow of your age and complexion will be content with
kissing? No, Joseph, there is no woman who grants that but will grant
more; and I am deceived greatly in you if you would not put her closely
to it. What would you think, Joseph, if I admitted you to kiss me?"
Joseph replied he would sooner die than have any such thought. "And
yet, Joseph," returned she, "ladies have admitted their footmen to such
familiarities; and footmen, I confess to you, much less deserving them;
fellows without half your charms--for such might almost excuse the
crime. Tell me therefore, Joseph, if I should admit you to such freedom,
what would you think of me?--tell me freely." "Madam," said Joseph, "I
should think your ladyship condescended a great deal below yourself."
"Pugh!" said she; "that I am to answer to myself: but would not you
insist on more? Would you be contented with a kiss? Would not your
inclinations be all on fire rather by such a favour?" "Madam," said
Joseph, "if they were, I hope I should be able to controul them, without
suffering them to get the better of my virtue." You have heard, reader,
poets talk of the statue of Surprize; you have heard likewise, or else
you have heard very little, how Surprize made one of the sons of Croesus
speak, though he was dumb. You have seen the faces, in the
eighteen-penny gallery, when, through the trap-door, to soft or no
music, Mr. Bridgewater, Mr. William Mills, or some other of ghostly
appearance, hath ascended, with a face all pale with powder, and a shirt
all bloody with ribbons;--but from none of these, nor from Phidias or
Praxiteles, if they should return to life--no, not from the inimitable
pencil of my friend Hogarth, could you receive such an idea of surprize
as would have entered in at your eyes had they beheld the Lady Booby
when those last words issued out from the lips of Joseph. "Your virtue!"
said the lady, recovering after a silence of two minutes; "I shall never
survive it. Your virtue!--intolerable confidence! Have you the assurance
to pretend, that when a lady demeans herself to throw aside the rules of
decency, in order to honour you with the highest favour in her power,
your virtue should resist her inclination? that, when she had conquered
her own virtue, she should find an obstruction in yours?" "Madam," said
Joseph, "I can't see why her having no virtue should be a reason against
my having any; or why, because I am a man, or because I am poor, my
virtue must be subservient to her pleasures." "I am out of patience,"
cries the lady: "did ever mortal hear of a man's virtue? Did ever the
greatest or the gravest men pretend to any of this kind? Will
magistrates who punish lewdness, or parsons who preach against it, make
any scruple of committing it? And can a boy, a stripling, have the
confidence to talk of his virtue?" "Madam," says Joseph, "that boy is
the brother of Pamela, and would be ashamed that the chastity of his
family, which is preserved in her, should be stained in him. If there
are such men as your ladyship mentions, I am sorry for it; and I wish
they had an opportunity of reading over those letters which my father
hath sent me of my sister Pamela's; nor do I doubt but such an example
would amend them." "You impudent villain!" cries the lady in a rage; "do
you insult me with the follies of my relation, who hath exposed himself
all over the country upon your sister's account? a little vixen, whom I
have always wondered my late Lady Booby ever kept in her house. Sirrah!
get out of my sight, and prepare to set out this night; for I will order
you your wages immediately, and you shall be stripped and turned away."
"Madam," says Joseph, "I am sorry I have offended your ladyship, I am
sure I never intended it." "Yes, sirrah," cries she, "you have had the
vanity to misconstrue the little innocent freedom I took, in order to
try whether what I had heard was true. O' my conscience, you have had
the assurance to imagine I was fond of you myself." Joseph answered, he
had only spoke out of tenderness for his virtue; at which words she
flew into a violent passion, and refusing to hear more, ordered him
instantly to leave the room.

He was no sooner gone than she burst forth into the following
exclamation:--"Whither doth this violent passion hurry us? What
meannesses do we submit to from its impulse! Wisely we resist its first
and least approaches; for it is then only we can assure ourselves the
victory. No woman could ever safely say, so far only will I go. Have I
not exposed myself to the refusal of my footman? I cannot bear the
reflection." Upon which she applied herself to the bell, and rung it
with infinite more violence than was necessary--the faithful Slipslop
attending near at hand: to say the truth, she had conceived a suspicion
at her last interview with her mistress, and had waited ever since in
the antechamber, having carefully applied her ears to the keyhole during
the whole time that the preceding conversation passed between Joseph
and the lady.



CHAPTER IX.

_What passed between the lady and Mrs Slipslop; in which we prophesy
there are some strokes which every one will not truly comprehend at the
first reading._


"Slipslop," said the lady, "I find too much reason to believe all thou
hast told me of this wicked Joseph; I have determined to part with him
instantly; so go you to the steward, and bid him pay his wages."
Slipslop, who had preserved hitherto a distance to her lady--rather out
of necessity than inclination--and who thought the knowledge of this
secret had thrown down all distinction between them, answered her
mistress very pertly--"She wished she knew her own mind; and that she
was certain she would call her back again before she was got half-way
downstairs." The lady replied, she had taken a resolution, and was
resolved to keep it. "I am sorry for it," cries Slipslop, "and, if I had
known you would have punished the poor lad so severely, you should never
have heard a particle of the matter. Here's a fuss indeed about
nothing!" "Nothing!" returned my lady; "do you think I will countenance
lewdness in my house?" "If you will turn away every footman," said
Slipslop, "that is a lover of the sport, you must soon open the coach
door yourself, or get a set of mophrodites to wait upon you; and I am
sure I hated the sight of them even singing in an opera." "Do as I bid
you," says my lady, "and don't shock my ears with your beastly
language." "Marry-come-up," cries Slipslop, "people's ears are sometimes
the nicest part about them."

The lady, who began to admire the new style in which her
waiting-gentlewoman delivered herself, and by the conclusion of her
speech suspected somewhat of the truth, called her back, and desired to
know what she meant by the extraordinary degree of freedom in which she
thought proper to indulge her tongue. "Freedom!" says Slipslop; "I don't
know what you call freedom, madam; servants have tongues as well as
their mistresses." "Yes, and saucy ones too," answered the lady; "but I
assure you I shall bear no such impertinence." "Impertinence! I don't
know that I am impertinent," says Slipslop. "Yes, indeed you are," cries
my lady, "and, unless you mend your manners, this house is no place for
you." "Manners!" cries Slipslop; "I never was thought to want manners
nor modesty neither; and for places, there are more places than one; and
I know what I know." "What do you know, mistress?" answered the lady. "I
am not obliged to tell that to everybody," says Slipslop, "any more than
I am obliged to keep it a secret." "I desire you would provide
yourself," answered the lady. "With all my heart," replied the
waiting-gentlewoman; and so departed in a passion, and slapped the door
after her.

The lady too plainly perceived that her waiting-gentlewoman knew more
than she would willingly have had her acquainted with; and this she
imputed to Joseph's having discovered to her what passed at the first
interview. This, therefore, blew up her rage against him, and confirmed
her in a resolution of parting with him.

But the dismissing Mrs Slipslop was a point not so easily to be resolved
upon. She had the utmost tenderness for her reputation, as she knew on
that depended many of the most valuable blessings of life; particularly
cards, making curtsies in public places, and, above all, the pleasure of
demolishing the reputations of others, in which innocent amusement she
had an extraordinary delight. She therefore determined to submit to any
insult from a servant, rather than run a risque of losing the title to
so many great privileges.

She therefore sent for her steward, Mr Peter Pounce, and ordered him to
pay Joseph his wages, to strip off his livery, and to turn him out of
the house that evening.

She then called Slipslop up, and, after refreshing her spirits with a
small cordial, which she kept in her corset, she began in the
following manner:--

"Slipslop, why will you, who know my passionate temper, attempt to
provoke me by your answers? I am convinced you are an honest servant,
and should be very unwilling to part with you. I believe, likewise, you
have found me an indulgent mistress on many occasions, and have as
little reason on your side to desire a change. I can't help being
surprized, therefore, that you will take the surest method to offend
me--I mean, repeating my words, which you know I have always detested."

The prudent waiting-gentlewoman had duly weighed the whole matter, and
found, on mature deliberation, that a good place in possession was
better than one in expectation. As she found her mistress, therefore,
inclined to relent, she thought proper also to put on some small
condescension, which was as readily accepted; and so the affair was
reconciled, all offences forgiven, and a present of a gown and petticoat
made her, as an instance of her lady's future favour.

She offered once or twice to speak in favour of Joseph; but found her
lady's heart so obdurate, that she prudently dropt all such efforts. She
considered there were more footmen in the house, and some as stout
fellows, though not quite so handsome, as Joseph; besides, the reader
hath already seen her tender advances had not met with the encouragement
she might have reasonable expected. She thought she had thrown away a
great deal of sack and sweetmeats on an ungrateful rascal; and, being a
little inclined to the opinion of that female sect, who hold one lusty
young fellow to be nearly as good as another lusty young fellow, she at
last gave up Joseph and his cause, and, with a triumph over her passion
highly commendable, walked off with her present, and with great
tranquillity paid a visit to a stone-bottle, which is of sovereign use
to a philosophical temper.

She left not her mistress so easy. The poor lady could not reflect
without agony that her dear reputation was in the power of her servants.
All her comfort as to Joseph was, that she hoped he did not understand
her meaning; at least she could say for herself, she had not plainly
expressed anything to him; and as to Mrs Slipslop, she imagines she
could bribe her to secrecy.

But what hurt her most was, that in reality she had not so entirely
conquered her passion; the little god lay lurking in her heart, though
anger and distain so hood-winked her, that she could not see him. She
was a thousand times on the very brink of revoking the sentence she had
passed against the poor youth. Love became his advocate, and whispered
many things in his favour. Honour likewise endeavoured to vindicate his
crime, and Pity to mitigate his punishment. On the other side, Pride and
Revenge spoke as loudly against him. And thus the poor lady was tortured
with perplexity, opposite passions distracting and tearing her mind
different ways.

So have I seen, in the hall of Westminster, where Serjeant Bramble hath
been retained on the right side, and Serjeant Puzzle on the left, the
balance of opinion (so equal were their fees) alternately incline to
either scale. Now Bramble throws in an argument, and Puzzle's scale
strikes the beam; again Bramble shares the like fate, overpowered by the
weight of Puzzle. Here Bramble hits, there Puzzle strikes; here one has
you, there t'other has you; till at last all becomes one scene of
confusion in the tortured minds of the hearers; equal wagers are laid on
the success, and neither judge nor jury can possibly make anything of
the matter; all things are so enveloped by the careful serjeants in
doubt and obscurity.

Or, as it happens in the conscience, where honour and honesty pull one
way, and a bribe and necessity another.--If it was our present
business only to make similes, we could produce many more to this
purpose; but a simile (as well as a word) to the wise.--We shall
therefore see a little after our hero, for whom the reader is doubtless
in some pain.



CHAPTER X.

_Joseph writes another letter: his transactions with Mr Peter Pounce,
&c., with his departure from Lady Booby._


The disconsolate Joseph would not have had an understanding sufficient
for the principal subject of such a book as this, if he had any longer
misunderstood the drift of his mistress; and indeed, that he did not
discern it sooner, the reader will be pleased to impute to an
unwillingness in him to discover what he must condemn in her as a fault.
Having therefore quitted her presence, he retired into his own garret,
and entered himself into an ejaculation on the numberless calamities
which attended beauty, and the misfortune it was to be handsomer than
one's neighbours.

He then sat down, and addressed himself to his sister Pamela in the
following words:--

"Dear Sister Pamela,--Hoping you are well, what news have I to tell you!
O Pamela! my mistress is fallen in love with me-that is, what great
folks call falling in love-she has a mind to ruin me; but I hope I shall
have more resolution and more grace than to part with my virtue to any
lady upon earth.

"Mr Adams hath often told me, that chastity is as great a virtue in a
man as in a woman. He says he never knew any more than his wife, and I
shall endeavour to follow his example. Indeed, it is owing entirely to
his excellent sermons and advice, together with your letters, that I
have been able to resist a temptation, which, he says, no man complies
with, but he repents in this world, or is damned for it in the next; and
why should I trust to repentance on my deathbed, since I may die in my
sleep? What fine things are good advice and good examples! But I am
glad she turned me out of the chamber as she did: for I had once almost
forgotten every word parson Adams had ever said to me.

"I don't doubt, dear sister, but you will have grace to preserve your
virtue against all trials; and I beg you earnestly to pray I may be
enabled to preserve mine; for truly it is very severely attacked by more
than one; but I hope I shall copy your example, and that of Joseph my
namesake, and maintain my virtue against all temptations."

Joseph had not finished his letter, when he was summoned downstairs by
Mr Peter Pounce, to receive his wages; for, besides that out of eight
pounds a year he allowed his father and mother four, he had been
obliged, in order to furnish himself with musical instruments, to apply
to the generosity of the aforesaid Peter, who, on urgent occasions, used
to advance the servants their wages: not before they were due, but
before they were payable; that is, perhaps, half a year after they were
due; and this at the moderate premium of fifty per cent, or a little
more: by which charitable methods, together with lending money to other
people, and even to his own master and mistress, the honest man had,
from nothing, in a few years amassed a small sum of twenty thousand
pounds or thereabouts.

Joseph having received his little remainder of wages, and having stript
off his livery, was forced to borrow a frock and breeches of one of the
servants (for he was so beloved in the family, that they would all have
lent him anything): and, being told by Peter that he must not stay a
moment longer in the house than was necessary to pack up his linen,
which he easily did in a very narrow compass, he took a melancholy leave
of his fellow-servants, and set out at seven in the evening.

He had proceeded the length of two or three streets, before he
absolutely determined with himself whether he should leave the town that
night, or, procuring a lodging, wait till the morning. At last, the moon
shining very bright helped him to come to a resolution of beginning his
journey immediately, to which likewise he had some other inducements;
which the reader, without being a conjurer, cannot possibly guess, till
we have given him those hints which it may be now proper to open.



CHAPTER XI.

_Of several new matters not expected._


It is an observation sometimes made, that to indicate our idea of a
simple fellow, we say, he is easily to be seen through: nor do I believe
it a more improper denotation of a simple book. Instead of applying this
to any particular performance, we chuse rather to remark the contrary in
this history, where the scene opens itself by small degrees; and he is a
sagacious reader who can see two chapters before him.

For this reason, we have not hitherto hinted a matter which now seems
necessary to be explained; since it may be wondered at, first, that
Joseph made such extraordinary haste out of town, which hath been
already shewn; and secondly, which will be now shewn, that, instead of
proceeding to the habitation of his father and mother, or to his beloved
sister Pamela, he chose rather to set out full speed to the Lady Booby's
country-seat, which he had left on his journey to London.

Be it known, then, that in the same parish where this seat stood there
lived a young girl whom Joseph (though the best of sons and brothers)
longed more impatiently to see than his parents or his sister. She was a
poor girl, who had formerly been bred up in Sir John's family; whence, a
little before the journey to London, she had been discarded by Mrs
Slipslop, on account of her extraordinary beauty: for I never could find
any other reason.

This young creature (who now lived with a farmer in the parish) had been
always beloved by Joseph, and returned his affection. She was two years
only younger than our hero. They had been acquainted from their infancy,
and had conceived a very early liking for each other; which had grown to
such a degree of affection, that Mr Adams had with much ado prevented
them from marrying, and persuaded them to wait till a few years' service
and thrift had a little improved their experience, and enabled them to
live comfortably together.

They followed this good man's advice, as indeed his word was little less
than a law in his parish; for as he had shown his parishioners, by an
uniform behaviour of thirty-five years' duration, that he had their good
entirely at heart, so they consulted him on every occasion, and very
seldom acted contrary to his opinion.

Nothing can be imagined more tender than was the parting between these
two lovers. A thousand sighs heaved the bosom of Joseph, a thousand
tears distilled from the lovely eyes of Fanny (for that was her name).
Though her modesty would only suffer her to admit his eager kisses, her
violent love made her more than passive in his embraces; and she often
pulled him to her breast with a soft pressure, which though perhaps it
would not have squeezed an insect to death, caused more emotion in the
heart of Joseph than the closest Cornish hug could have done.

The reader may perhaps wonder that so fond a pair should, during a
twelvemonth's absence, never converse with one another: indeed, there
was but one reason which did or could have prevented them; and this was,
that poor Fanny could neither write nor read: nor could she be prevailed
upon to transmit the delicacies of her tender and chaste passion by the
hands of an amanuensis.

They contented themselves therefore with frequent inquiries after each
other's health, with a mutual confidence in each other's fidelity, and
the prospect of their future happiness.

Having explained these matters to our reader, and, as far as possible,
satisfied all his doubts, we return to honest Joseph, whom we left just
set out on his travels by the light of the moon.

Those who have read any romance or poetry, antient or modern, must have
been informed that love hath wings: by which they are not to understand,
as some young ladies by mistake have done, that a lover can fly; the
writers, by this ingenious allegory, intending to insinuate no more than
that lovers do not march like horse-guards; in short, that they put the
best leg foremost; which our lusty youth, who could walk with any man,
did so heartily on this occasion, that within four hours he reached a
famous house of hospitality well known to the western traveller. It
presents you a lion on the sign-post: and the master, who was christened
Timotheus, is commonly called plain Tim. Some have conceived that he
hath particularly chosen the lion for his sign, as he doth in
countenance greatly resemble that magnanimous beast, though his
disposition savours more of the sweetness of the lamb. He is a person
well received among all sorts of men, being qualified to render himself
agreeable to any; as he is well versed in history and politics, hath a
smattering in law and divinity, cracks a good jest, and plays
wonderfully well on the French horn.

A violent storm of hail forced Joseph to take shelter in this inn, where
he remembered Sir Thomas had dined in his way to town. Joseph had no
sooner seated himself by the kitchen fire than Timotheus, observing his
livery, began to condole the loss of his late master; who was, he said,
his very particular and intimate acquaintance, with whom he had cracked
many a merry bottle, ay many a dozen, in his time. He then remarked,
that all these things were over now, all passed, and just as if they had
never been; and concluded with an excellent observation on the certainty
of death, which his wife said was indeed very true. A fellow now arrived
at the same inn with two horses, one of which he was leading farther
down into the country to meet his master; these he put into the stable,
and came and took his place by Joseph's side, who immediately knew him
to be the servant of a neighbouring gentleman, who used to visit at
their house.

This fellow was likewise forced in by the storm; for he had orders to go
twenty miles farther that evening, and luckily on the same road which
Joseph himself intended to take. He, therefore, embraced this
opportunity of complimenting his friend with his master's horse
(notwithstanding he had received express commands to the contrary),
which was readily accepted; and so, after they had drank a loving pot,
and the storm was over, they set out together.



CHAPTER XII.

_Containing many surprizing adventures which Joseph Andrews met with on
the road, scarce credible to those who have never travelled in a
stage-coach._


Nothing remarkable happened on the road till their arrival at the inn to
which the horses were ordered; whither they came about two in the
morning. The moon then shone very bright; and Joseph, making his friend
a present of a pint of wine, and thanking him for the favour of his
horse, notwithstanding all entreaties to the contrary, proceeded on his
journey on foot.

He had not gone above two miles, charmed with the hope of shortly seeing
his beloved Fanny, when he was met by two fellows in a narrow lane, and
ordered to stand and deliver. He readily gave them all the money he had,
which was somewhat less than two pounds; and told them he hoped they
would be so generous as to return him a few shillings, to defray his
charges on his way home.

One of the ruffians answered with an oath, "Yes, we'll give you
something presently: but first strip and be d---n'd to you."--"Strip,"
cried the other, "or I'll blow your brains to the devil." Joseph,
remembering that he had borrowed his coat and breeches of a friend, and
that he should be ashamed of making any excuse for not returning them,
replied, he hoped they would not insist on his clothes, which were not
worth much, but consider the coldness of the night. "You are cold, are
you, you rascal?" said one of the robbers: "I'll warm you with a
vengeance;" and, damning his eyes, snapped a pistol at his head; which
he had no sooner done than the other levelled a blow at him with his
stick, which Joseph, who was expert at cudgel-playing, caught with his,
and returned the favour so successfully on his adversary, that he laid
him sprawling at his feet, and at the same instant received a blow from
behind, with the butt end of a pistol, from the other villain, which
felled him to the ground, and totally deprived him of his senses.

The thief who had been knocked down had now recovered himself; and both
together fell to belabouring poor Joseph with their sticks, till they
were convinced they had put an end to his miserable being: they then
stripped him entirely naked, threw him into a ditch, and departed with
their booty.

The poor wretch, who lay motionless a long time, just began to recover
his senses as a stage-coach came by. The postillion, hearing a man's
groans, stopt his horses, and told the coachman he was certain there was
a dead man lying in the ditch, for he heard him groan. "Go on, sirrah,"
says the coachman; "we are confounded late, and have no time to look
after dead men." A lady, who heard what the postillion said, and
likewise heard the groan, called eagerly to the coachman to stop and see
what was the matter. Upon which he bid the postillion alight, and look
into the ditch. He did so, and returned, "that there was a man sitting
upright, as naked as ever he was born."--"O J--sus!" cried the lady; "a
naked man! Dear coachman, drive on and leave him." Upon this the
gentlemen got out of the coach; and Joseph begged them to have mercy
upon him: for that he had been robbed and almost beaten to death.
"Robbed!" cries an old gentleman: "let us make all the haste imaginable,
or we shall be robbed too." A young man who belonged to the law
answered, "He wished they had passed by without taking any notice; but
that now they might be proved to have been last in his company; if he
should die they might be called to some account for his murder. He
therefore thought it advisable to save the poor creature's life, for
their own sakes, if possible; at least, if he died, to prevent the
jury's finding that they fled for it. He was therefore of opinion to
take the man into the coach, and carry him to the next inn." The lady
insisted, "That he should not come into the coach. That if they lifted
him in, she would herself alight: for she had rather stay in that place
to all eternity than ride with a naked man." The coachman objected,
"That he could not suffer him to be taken in unless somebody would pay a
shilling for his carriage the four miles." Which the two gentlemen
refused to do. But the lawyer, who was afraid of some mischief happening
to himself, if the wretch was left behind in that condition, saying no
man could be too cautious in these matters, and that he remembered very
extraordinary cases in the books, threatened the coachman, and bid him
deny taking him up at his peril; for that, if he died, he should be
indicted for his murder; and if he lived, and brought an action against
him, he would willingly take a brief in it. These words had a sensible
effect on the coachman, who was well acquainted with the person who
spoke them; and the old gentleman above mentioned, thinking the naked
man would afford him frequent opportunities of showing his wit to the
lady, offered to join with the company in giving a mug of beer for his
fare; till, partly alarmed by the threats of the one, and partly by the
promises of the other, and being perhaps a little moved with compassion
at the poor creature's condition, who stood bleeding and shivering with
the cold, he at length agreed; and Joseph was now advancing to the
coach, where, seeing the lady, who held the sticks of her fan before her
eyes, he absolutely refused, miserable as he was, to enter, unless he
was furnished with sufficient covering to prevent giving the least
offence to decency--so perfectly modest was this young man; such mighty
effects had the spotless example of the amiable Pamela, and the
excellent sermons of Mr Adams, wrought upon him.

Though there were several greatcoats about the coach, it was not easy to
get over this difficulty which Joseph had started. The two gentlemen
complained they were cold, and could not spare a rag; the man of wit
saying, with a laugh, that charity began at home; and the coachman, who
had two greatcoats spread under him, refused to lend either, lest they
should be made bloody: the lady's footman desired to be excused for the
same reason, which the lady herself, notwithstanding her abhorrence of a
naked man, approved: and it is more than probable poor Joseph, who
obstinately adhered to his modest resolution, must have perished, unless
the postillion (a lad who hath been since transported for robbing a
hen-roost) had voluntarily stript off a greatcoat, his only garment, at
the same time swearing a great oath (for which he was rebuked by the
passengers), "that he would rather ride in his shirt all his life than
suffer a fellow-creature to lie in so miserable a condition."

Joseph, having put on the greatcoat, was lifted into the coach, which
now proceeded on its journey. He declared himself almost dead with the
cold, which gave the man of wit an occasion to ask the lady if she could
not accommodate him with a dram. She answered, with some resentment,
"She wondered at his asking her such a question; but assured him she
never tasted any such thing."

The lawyer was inquiring into the circumstances of the robbery, when the
coach stopt, and one of the ruffians, putting a pistol in, demanded
their money of the passengers, who readily gave it them; and the lady,
in her fright, delivered up a little silver bottle, of about a
half-pint size, which the rogue, clapping it to his mouth, and drinking
her health, declared, held some of the best Nantes he had ever tasted:
this the lady afterwards assured the company was the mistake of her
maid, for that she had ordered her to fill the bottle with
Hungary-water.

As soon as the fellows were departed, the lawyer, who had, it seems, a
case of pistols in the seat of the coach, informed the company, that if
it had been daylight, and he could have come at his pistols, he would
not have submitted to the robbery: he likewise set forth that he had
often met highwaymen when he travelled on horseback, but none ever durst
attack him; concluding that, if he had not been more afraid for the lady
than for himself, he should not have now parted with his money
so easily.

As wit is generally observed to love to reside in empty pockets, so the
gentleman whose ingenuity we have above remarked, as soon as he had
parted with his money, began to grow wonderfully facetious. He made
frequent allusions to Adam and Eve, and said many excellent things on
figs and fig-leaves; which perhaps gave more offence to Joseph than to
any other in the company.

The lawyer likewise made several very pretty jests without departing
from his profession. He said, "If Joseph and the lady were alone, he
would be more capable of making a conveyance to her, as his affairs were
not fettered with any incumbrance; he'd warrant he soon suffered a
recovery by a writ of entry, which was the proper way to create heirs in
tail; that, for his own part, he would engage to make so firm a
settlement in a coach, that there should be no danger of an ejectment,"
with an inundation of the like gibberish, which he continued to vent
till the coach arrived at an inn, where one servant-maid only was up, in
readiness to attend the coachman, and furnish him with cold meat and a
dram. Joseph desired to alight, and that he might have a bed prepared
for him, which the maid readily promised to perform; and, being a
good-natured wench, and not so squeamish as the lady had been, she clapt
a large fagot on the fire, and, furnishing Joseph with a greatcoat
belonging to one of the hostlers, desired him to sit down and warm
himself whilst she made his bed. The coachman, in the meantime, took an
opportunity to call up a surgeon, who lived within a few doors; after
which, he reminded his passengers how late they were, and, after they
had taken leave of Joseph, hurried them off as fast as he could.

The wench soon got Joseph to bed, and promised to use her interest to
borrow him a shirt; but imagining, as she afterwards said, by his being
so bloody, that he must be a dead man, she ran with all speed to hasten
the surgeon, who was more than half drest, apprehending that the coach
had been overturned, and some gentleman or lady hurt. As soon as the
wench had informed him at his window that it was a poor foot-passenger
who had been stripped of all he had, and almost murdered, he chid her
for disturbing him so early, slipped off his clothes again, and very
quietly returned to bed and to sleep.

Aurora now began to shew her blooming cheeks over the hills, whilst ten
millions of feathered songsters, in jocund chorus, repeated odes a
thousand times sweeter than those of our laureat, and sung both the day
and the song; when the master of the inn, Mr Tow-wouse, arose, and
learning from his maid an account of the robbery, and the situation of
his poor naked guest, he shook his head, and cried, "good-lack-a-day!"
and then ordered the girl to carry him one of his own shirts.

Mrs Tow-wouse was just awake, and had stretched out her arms in vain to
fold her departed husband, when the maid entered the room. "Who's there?
Betty?"--"Yes, madam."--"Where's your master?"--"He's without, madam;
he hath sent me for a shirt to lend a poor naked man, who hath been
robbed and murdered."--"Touch one if you dare, you slut," said Mrs
Tow-wouse: "your master is a pretty sort of a man, to take in naked
vagabonds, and clothe them with his own clothes. I shall have no such
doings. If you offer to touch anything, I'll throw the chamber-pot at
your head. Go, send your master to me."--"Yes, madam," answered Betty.
As soon as he came in, she thus began: "What the devil do you mean by
this, Mr Tow-wouse? Am I to buy shirts to lend to a set of scabby
rascals?"--"My dear," said Mr Tow-wouse, "this is a poor
wretch."--"Yes," says she, "I know it is a poor wretch; but what the
devil have we to do with poor wretches? The law makes us provide for too
many already. We shall have thirty or forty poor wretches in red coats
shortly."--"My dear," cries Tow-wouse, "this man hath been robbed of all
he hath."--"Well then," said she, "where's his money to pay his
reckoning? Why doth not such a fellow go to an alehouse? I shall send
him packing as soon as I am up, I assure you."--"My dear," said he,
"common charity won't suffer you to do that."--"Common charity, a f--t!"
says she, "common charity teaches us to provide for ourselves and our
families; and I and mine won't be ruined by your charity, I assure
you."--"Well," says he, "my dear, do as you will, when you are up; you
know I never contradict you."--"No," says she; "if the devil was to
contradict me, I would make the house too hot to hold him."

With such like discourses they consumed near half-an-hour, whilst Betty
provided a shirt from the hostler, who was one of her sweethearts, and
put it on poor Joseph. The surgeon had likewise at last visited him, and
washed and drest his wounds, and was now come to acquaint Mr Tow-wouse
that his guest was in such extreme danger of his life, that he scarce
saw any hopes of his recovery. "Here's a pretty kettle of fish," cries
Mrs Tow-wouse, "you have brought upon us! We are like to have a funeral
at our own expense." Tow-wouse (who, notwithstanding his charity, would
have given his vote as freely as ever he did at an election, that any
other house in the kingdom should have quiet possession of his guest)
answered, "My dear, I am not to blame; he was brought hither by the
stage-coach, and Betty had put him to bed before I was stirring."--"I'll
Betty her," says she.--At which, with half her garments on, the other
half under her arm, she sallied out in quest of the unfortunate Betty,
whilst Tow-wouse and the surgeon went to pay a visit to poor Joseph, and
inquire into the circumstances of this melancholy affair.



CHAPTER XIII.

_What happened to Joseph during his sickness at the inn, with the
curious discourse between him and Mr Barnabas, the parson of
the parish._


As soon as Joseph had communicated a particular history of the robbery,
together with a short account of himself, and his intended journey, he
asked the surgeon if he apprehended him to be in any danger: to which
the surgeon very honestly answered, "He feared he was; for that his
pulse was very exalted and feverish, and, if his fever should prove more
than symptomatic, it would be impossible to save him." Joseph, fetching
a deep sigh, cried, "Poor Fanny, I would I could have lived to see thee!
but God's will be done."

The surgeon then advised him, if he had any worldly affairs to settle,
that he would do it as soon as possible; for, though he hoped he might
recover, yet he thought himself obliged to acquaint him he was in great
danger; and if the malign concoction of his humours should cause a
suscitation of his fever, he might soon grow delirious and incapable to
make his will. Joseph answered, "That it was impossible for any creature
in the universe to be in a poorer condition than himself; for since the
robbery he had not one thing of any kind whatever which he could call
his own." "I had," said he, "a poor little piece of gold, which they
took away, that would have been a comfort to me in all my afflictions;
but surely, Fanny, I want nothing to remind me of thee. I have thy dear
image in my heart, and no villain can ever tear it thence."

Joseph desired paper and pens, to write a letter, but they were refused
him; and he was advised to use all his endeavours to compose himself.
They then left him; and Mr Tow-wouse sent to a clergyman to come and
administer his good offices to the soul of poor Joseph, since the
surgeon despaired of making any successful applications to his body.

Mr Barnabas (for that was the clergyman's name) came as soon as sent
for; and, having first drank a dish of tea with the landlady, and
afterwards a bowl of punch with the landlord, he walked up to the room
where Joseph lay; but, finding him asleep, returned to take the other
sneaker; which when he had finished, he again crept softly up to the
chamber-door, and, having opened it, heard the sick man talking to
himself in the following manner:--

"O most adorable Pamela! most virtuous sister! whose example could alone
enable me to withstand all the temptations of riches and beauty, and to
preserve my virtue pure and chaste for the arms of my dear Fanny, if it
had pleased Heaven that I should ever have come unto them. What riches,
or honours, or pleasures, can make us amends for the loss of innocence?
Doth not that alone afford us more consolation than all worldly
acquisitions? What but innocence and virtue could give any comfort to
such a miserable wretch as I am? Yet these can make me prefer this sick
and painful bed to all the pleasures I should have found in my lady's.
These can make me face death without fear; and though I love my Fanny
more than ever man loved a woman, these can teach me to resign myself to
the Divine will without repining. O thou delightful charming creature!
if Heaven had indulged thee to my arms, the poorest, humblest state
would have been a paradise; I could have lived with thee in the lowest
cottage without envying the palaces, the dainties, or the riches of any
man breathing. But I must leave thee, leave thee for ever, my dearest
angel! I must think of another world; and I heartily pray thou may'st
meet comfort in this."--Barnabas thought he had heard enough, so
downstairs he went, and told Tow-wouse he could do his guest no service;
for that he was very light-headed, and had uttered nothing but a
rhapsody of nonsense all the time he stayed in the room.

The surgeon returned in the afternoon, and found his patient in a higher
fever, as he said, than when he left him, though not delirious; for,
notwithstanding Mr Barnabas's opinion, he had not been once out of his
senses since his arrival at the inn.

Mr Barnabas was again sent for, and with much difficulty prevailed on to
make another visit. As soon as he entered the room he told Joseph "He
was come to pray by him, and to prepare him for another world: in the
first place, therefore, he hoped he had repented of all his sins."
Joseph answered, "He hoped he had; but there was one thing which he knew
not whether he should call a sin; if it was, he feared he should die in
the commission of it; and that was, the regret of parting with a young
woman whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heart-strings." Barnabas
bad him be assured "that any repining at the Divine will was one of the
greatest sins he could commit; that he ought to forget all carnal
affections, and think of better things." Joseph said, "That neither in
this world nor the next he could forget his Fanny; and that the thought,
however grievous, of parting from her for ever, was not half so
tormenting as the fear of what she would suffer when she knew his
misfortune." Barnabas said, "That such fears argued a diffidence and
despondence very criminal; that he must divest himself of all human
passions, and fix his heart above." Joseph answered, "That was what he
desired to do, and should be obliged to him if he would enable him to
accomplish it." Barnabas replied, "That must be done by grace." Joseph
besought him to discover how he might attain it. Barnabas answered, "By
prayer and faith." He then questioned him concerning his forgiveness of
the thieves. Joseph answered, "He feared that was more than he could do;
for nothing would give him more pleasure than to hear they were
taken."--"That," cries Barnabas, "is for the sake of justice."--"Yes,"
said Joseph, "but if I was to meet them again, I am afraid I should
attack them, and kill them too, if I could."--"Doubtless," answered
Barnabas, "it is lawful to kill a thief; bu
least come up to town and let him see me, when he would further enter
into discourse about it.

I was exceedingly surprised at the news, and began now seriously to
reflect on my present circumstances, and the inexpressible misfortune
it was to me to have a child upon my hands, and what to do in it I knew
not.  At last I opened my case at a distance to my governess.  I
appeared melancholy and uneasy for several days, and she lay at me
continually to know what trouble me.  I could not for my life tell her
that I had an offer of marriage, after I had so often told her that I
had a husband, so that I really knew not what to say to her.  I owned I
had something which very much troubled me, but at the same time told
her I could not speak of it to any one alive.

She continued importuning me several days, but it was impossible, I
told her, for me to commit the secret to anybody.  This, instead of
being an answer to her, increased her importunities; she urged her
having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature, that it
was her business to conceal everything, and that to discover things of
that nature would be her ruin.  She asked me if ever I had found her
tattling to me of other people's affairs, and how could I suspect her?
She told me, to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody; that she
was silent as death; that it must be a very strange case indeed that
she could not help me out of; but to conceal it was to deprive myself
of all possible help, or means of help, and to deprive her of the
opportunity of serving me.  In short, she had such a bewitching
eloquence, and so great a power of persuasion that there was no
concealing anything from her.

So I resolved to unbosom myself to her.  I told her the history of my
Lancashire marriage, and how both of us had been disappointed; how we
came together, and how we parted; how he absolutely discharged me, as
far as lay in him, free liberty to marry again, protesting that if he
knew it he would never claim me, or disturb or expose me; that I
thought I was free, but was dreadfully afraid to venture, for fear of
the consequences that might follow in case of a discovery.

Then I told her what a good offer I had; showed her my friend's two
last letters, inviting me to come to London, and let her see with what
affection and earnestness they were written, but blotted out the name,
and also the story about the disaster of his wife, only that she was
dead.

She fell a-laughing at my scruples about marrying, and told me the
other was no marriage, but a cheat on both sides; and that, as we were
parted by mutual consent, the nature of the contract was destroyed, and
the obligation was mutually discharged.  She had arguments for this at
the tip of her tongue; and, in short, reasoned me out of my reason; not
but that it was too by the help of my own inclination.

But then came the great and main difficulty, and that was the child;
this, she told me in so many words, must be removed, and that so as
that it should never be possible for any one to discover it.  I knew
there was no marrying without entirely concealing that I had had a
child, for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was
born, nay, and gotten too, since my parley with him, and that would
have destroyed all the affair.

But it touched my heart so forcibly to think of parting entirely with
the child, and, for aught I knew, of having it murdered, or starved by
neglect and ill-usage (which was much the same), that I could not think
of it without horror.  I wish all those women who consent to the
disposing their children out of the way, as it is called, for decency
sake, would consider that 'tis only a contrived method for murder; that
is to say, a-killing their children with safety.

It is manifest to all that understand anything of children, that we are
born into the world helpless, and incapable either to supply our own
wants or so much as make them known; and that without help we must
perish; and this help requires not only an assisting hand, whether of
the mother or somebody else, but there are two things necessary in that
assisting  hand, that is, care and skill; without both which, half the
children that are born would die, nay, though they were not to be
denied food; and one half more of those that remained would be cripples
or fools, lose their limbs, and perhaps their sense.  I question not
but that these are partly the reasons why affection was placed by
nature in the hearts of mothers to their children; without which they
would never be able to give themselves up, as 'tis necessary they
should, to the care and waking pains needful to the support of their
children.

Since this care is needful to the life of children, to neglect them is
to murder them; again, to give them up to be managed by those people
who have none of that needful affection placed by nature in them, is to
neglect them in the highest degree; nay, in some it goes farther, and
is a neglect in order to their being lost; so that 'tis even an
intentional murder, whether the child lives or dies.

All those things represented themselves to my view, and that is the
blackest and most frightful form:  and as I was very free with my
governess, whom I had now learned to call mother, I represented to her
all the dark thoughts which I had upon me about it, and told her what
distress I was in.  She seemed graver by much at this part than at the
other; but as she was hardened in these things beyond all possibility
of being touched with the religious part, and the scruples about the
murder, so she was equally impenetrable in that part which related to
affection.  She asked me if she had not been careful and tender to me
in my lying in, as if I had been her own child.  I told her I owned she
had.  'Well, my dear,' says she, 'and when you are gone, what are you
to me?  And what would it be to me if you were to be hanged?  Do you
think there are not women who, as it is their trade and they get their
bread by it, value themselves upon their being as careful of children
as their own mothers can be, and understand it rather better?  Yes,
yes, child,' says she, 'fear it not; how were we nursed ourselves?  Are
you sure you was nursed up by your own mother? and yet you look fat and
fair, child,' says the old beldam; and with that she stroked me over
the face.  'Never be concerned, child,' says she, going on in her
drolling way; 'I have no murderers about me; I employ the best and the
honestest nurses that can be had, and have as few children miscarry
under their hands as there would if they were all nursed by mothers; we
want neither care nor skill.'

She touched me to the quick when she asked if I was sure that I was
nursed by my own mother; on the contrary I was sure I was not; and I
trembled, and looked pale at the very expression.  'Sure,' said I to
myself, 'this creature cannot be a witch, or have any conversation with
a spirit, that can inform her what was done with me before I was able
to know it myself'; and I looked at her as if I had been frightened;
but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know anything
about me, that disorder went off, and I began to be easy, but it was
not presently.

She perceived the disorder I was in, but did not know the meaning of
it; so she ran on in her wild talk upon the weakness of my supposing
that children were murdered because they were not all nursed by the
mother, and to persuade me that the children she disposed of were as
well used as if the mothers had the nursing of them themselves.

'It may be true, mother,' says I, 'for aught I know, but my doubts are
very strongly grounded indeed.'  'Come, then,' says she, 'let's hear
some of them.'  'Why, first,' says I, 'you give a piece of money to
these people to take the child off the parent's hands, and to take care
of it as long as it lives.  Now we know, mother,' said I, 'that those
are poor people, and their gain consists in being quit of the charge as
soon as they can; how can I doubt but that, as it is best for them to
have the child die, they are not over solicitous about life?'

'This is all vapours and fancy,' says the old woman; 'I tell you their
credit depends upon the child's life, and they are as careful as any
mother of you all.'

'O mother,' says I, 'if I was but sure my little baby would be
carefully looked to, and have justice done it, I should be happy
indeed; but it is impossible I can be satisfied in that point unless I
saw it, and to see it would be ruin and destruction to me, as now my
case stands; so what to do I know not.'

'A fine story!' says the governess.  'You would see the child, and you
would not see the child; you would be concealed and discovered both
together.  These are things impossible, my dear; so you must e'en do as
other conscientious mothers have done before you, and be contented with
things as they must be, though they are not as you wish them to be.'

I understood what she meant by conscientious mothers; she would have
said conscientious whores, but she was not willing to disoblige me, for
really in this case I was not a whore, because legally married, the
force of former marriage excepted.

However, let me be what I would, I was not come up to that pitch of
hardness common to the profession; I mean, to be unnatural, and
regardless of the safety of my child; and I preserved this honest
affection so long, that I was upon the point of giving up my friend at
the bank, who lay so hard at me to come to him and marry him, that, in
short, there was hardly any room to deny him.

At last my old governess came to me, with her usual assurance.  'Come,
my dear,' says she, 'I have found out a way how you shall be at a
certainty that your child shall be used well, and yet the people that
take care of it shall never know you, or who the mother of the child
is.'

'Oh mother,' says I, 'if you can do so, you will engage me to you for
ever.'  'Well,' says she, 'are you willing to be a some small annual
expense, more than what we usually give to the people we contract
with?'  'Ay,' says I, 'with all my heart, provided I may be concealed.'
'As to that,' says the governess, 'you shall be secure, for the nurse
shall never so much as dare to inquire about you, and you shall once or
twice a year go with me and see your child, and see how 'tis used, and
be satisfied that it is in good hands, nobody knowing who you are.'

'Why,' said I, 'do you think, mother, that when I come to see my child,
I shall be able to conceal my being the mother of it?  Do you think
that possible?'

'Well, well,' says my governess, 'if you discover it, the nurse shall
be never the wiser; for she shall be forbid to ask any questions about
you, or to take any notice.  If she offers it, she shall lose the money
which you are suppose to give her, and the child shall be taken from
her too.'

I was very well pleased with this.  So the next week a countrywoman was
brought from Hertford, or thereabouts, who was to take the child off
our hands entirely for #10 in money.  But if I would allow #5 a year
more of her, she would be obliged to bring the child to my governess's
house as often as we desired, or we should come down and look at it,
and see how well she used it.

The woman was very wholesome-looking, a likely woman, a cottager's
wife, but she had very good clothes and linen, and everything well
about her; and with a heavy heart and many a tear, I let her have my
child.  I had been down at Hertford, and looked at her and at her
dwelling, which I liked well enough; and I promised her great things if
she would be kind to the child, so she knew at first word that I was
the child's mother.  But she seemed to be so much out of the way, and
to have no room to inquire after me, that I thought I was safe enough.
So, in short, I consented to let her have the child, and I gave her
#10; that is to say, I gave it to my governess, who gave it the poor
woman before my face, she agreeing never to return the child back to
me, or to claim anything more for its keeping or bringing up; only that
I promised, if she took a great deal of care of it, I would give her
something more as often as I came to see it; so that I was not bound to
pay the #5, only that I promised my governess I would do it.  And thus
my great care was over, after a manner, which though it did not at all
satisfy my mind, yet was the most convenient for me, as my affairs then
stood, of any that could be thought of at that time.

I then began to write to my friend at the bank in a more kindly style,
and particularly about the beginning of July I sent him a letter, that
I proposed to be in town some time in August.  He returned me an answer
in the most passionate terms imaginable, and desired me to let him have
timely notice, and he would come and meet me, two day's journey.  This
puzzled me scurvily, and I did not know what answer to make of it.
Once I resolved to take the stage-coach to West Chester, on purpose
only to have the satisfaction of coming back, that he might see me
really come in the same coach; for I had a jealous thought, though I
had no ground for it at all, lest he should think I was not really in
the country.  And it was no ill-grounded thought as you shall hear
presently.

I endeavoured to reason myself out of it, but it was in vain; the
impression lay so strong on my mind, that it was not to be resisted.
At last it came as an addition to my new design of going into the
country, that it would be an excellent blind to my old governess, and
would cover entirely all my other affairs, for she did not know in the
least whether my new lover lived in London or in Lancashire; and when I
told her my resolution, she was fully persuaded it was in Lancashire.

Having taken my measure for this journey I let her know it, and sent
the maid that tended me, from the beginning, to take a place for me in
the coach.  She would have had me let the maid have waited on me down
to the last stage, and come up again in the waggon, but I convinced her
it would not be convenient.  When I went away, she told me she would
enter into no measures for correspondence, for she saw evidently that
my affection to my child would cause me to write to her, and to visit
her too when I came to town again.  I assured her it would, and so took
my leave, well satisfied to have been freed from such a house, however
good my accommodations there had been, as I have related above.

I took the place in the coach not to its full extent, but to a place
called Stone, in Cheshire, I think it is, where I not only had no
manner of business, but not so much as the least acquaintance with any
person in the town or near it.  But I knew that with money in the
pocket one is at home anywhere; so I lodged there two or three days,
till, watching my opportunity, I found room in another stage-coach, and
took passage back again for London, sending a letter to my gentleman
that I should be such a certain day at Stony-Stratford, where the
coachman told me he was to lodge.

It happened to be a chance coach that I had taken up, which, having
been hired on purpose to carry some gentlemen to West Chester who were
going for Ireland, was now returning, and did not tie itself to exact
times or places as the stages did; so that, having been obliged to lie
still on Sunday, he had time to get himself ready to come out, which
otherwise he could not have done.

However, his warning was so short, that he could not reach to
Stony-Stratford time enough to be with me at night, but he met me at a
place called Brickhill the next morning, as we were just coming in to
tow.

I confess I was very glad to see him, for I had thought myself a little
disappointed over-night, seeing I had gone so far to contrive my coming
on purpose.  He pleased me doubly too by the figure he came in, for he
brought a very handsome (gentleman's) coach and four horses, with a
servant to attend him.

He took me out of the stage-coach immediately, which stopped at an inn
in Brickhill; and putting into the same inn, he set up his own coach,
and bespoke his dinner.  I asked him what he meant by that, for I was
for going forward with the journey.  He said, No, I had need of a
little rest upon the road, and that was a very good sort of a house,
though it was but a little town; so we would go no farther that night,
whatever came of it.

I did not press him much, for since he had come so to meet me, and put
himself to so much expense, it was but reasonable I should oblige him a
little too; so I was easy as to that point.

After dinner we walked to see the town, to see the church, and to view
the fields, and the country, as is usual for strangers to do; and our
landlord was our guide in going to see the church. I observed my
gentleman inquired pretty much about the parson, and I took the hint
immediately that he certainly would propose to be married; and though
it was a sudden thought, it followed presently, that, in short, I would
not refuse him; for, to be plain, with my circumstances I was in no
condition now to say No; I had no reason now to run any more such
hazards.

But while these thoughts ran round in my head, which was the work but
of a few moments, I observed my landlord took him aside and whispered
to him, though not very softly neither, for so much I overheard:  'Sir,
if you shall have occasion----' the rest I could not hear, but it seems
it was to this purpose:  'Sir, if you shall have occasion for a
minister, I have a friend a little way off that will serve you, and be
as private as you please.' My gentleman answered loud enough for me to
hear, 'Very well, I believe I shall.'

I was no sooner come back to the inn but he fell upon me with
irresistible words, that since he had had the good fortune to meet me,
and everything concurred, it would be hastening his felicity if I would
put an end to the matter just there.  'What do you mean?' says I,
colouring a little.  'What, in an inn, and upon the road!  Bless us
all,' said I, as if I had been surprised, 'how can you talk so?'  'Oh,
I can talk so very well,' says he, 'I came a-purpose to talk so, and
I'll show you that I did'; and with that he pulls out a great bundle of
papers.  'You fright me,' said I; 'what are all these?'  'Don't be
frighted, my dear,' said he, and kissed me.  This was the first time
that he had been so free to call me 'my dear'; then he repeated it,
'Don't be frighted; you shall see what it is all'; then he laid them
all abroad.  There was first the deed or sentence of divorce from his
wife, and the full evidence of her playing the whore; then there were
the certificates of the minister and churchwardens of the parish where
she lived, proving that she was buried, and intimating the manner of
her death; the copy of the coroner's warrant for a jury to sit upon
her, and the verdict of the jury, who brought it in Non compos mentis.
All this was indeed to the purpose, and to give me satisfaction,
though, by the way, I was not so scrupulous, had he known all, but that
I might have taken him without it.  However, I looked them all over as
well as I could, and told him that this was all very clear indeed, but
that he need not have given himself the trouble to have brought them
out with him, for it was time enough.  Well, he said, it might be time
enough for me, but no time but the present time was time enough for him.

There were other papers rolled up, and I asked him what they were.
'Why, ay,' says he, 'that's the question I wanted to have you ask me';
so he unrolls them and takes out a little shagreen case, and gives me
out of it a very fine diamond ring.  I could not refuse it, if I had a
mind to do so, for he put it upon my finger; so I made him a curtsy and
accepted it.  Then he takes out another ring:  'And this,' says he, 'is
for another occasion,' so he puts that in his pocket.  'Well, but let
me see it, though,' says I, and smiled; 'I guess what it is; I think
you are mad.' 'I should have been mad if I had done less,' says he, and
still he did not show me, and I had a great mind to see it; so I says,
'Well, but let me see it.'  'Hold,' says he, 'first look here'; then he
took up the roll again and read it, and behold! it was a licence for us
to be married.  'Why,' says I, 'are you distracted?  Why, you were
fully satisfied that I would comply and yield at first word, or
resolved to take no denial.'  'The last is certainly the case,' said
he.  'But you may be mistaken,' said I.  'No, no,' says he, 'how can
you think so?  I must not be denied, I can't be denied'; and with that
he fell to kissing me so violently, I could not get rid of him.

There was a bed in the room, and we were walking to and again, eager in
the discourse; at last he takes me by surprise in his arms, and threw
me on the bed and himself with me, and holding me fast in his arms, but
without the least offer of any indecency, courted me to consent with
such repeated entreaties and arguments, protesting his affection, and
vowing he would not let me go till I had promised him, that at last I
said, 'Why, you resolve not to be denied, indeed, I can't be denied.'
'Well, well,' said I, and giving him a slight kiss, 'then you shan't be
denied,' said I; 'let me get up.'

He was so transported with my consent, and the kind manner of it, that
I began to think once he took it for a marriage, and would not stay for
the form; but I wronged him, for he gave over kissing me, and then
giving me two or three kisses again, thanked me for my kind yielding to
him; and was so overcome with the satisfaction and joy of it, that I
saw tears stand in his eyes.

I turned from him, for it filled my eyes with tears too, and I asked
him leave to retire a little to my chamber.  If ever I had a grain of
true repentance for a vicious and abominable life for twenty-four years
past, it was then.  On, what a felicity is it to mankind, said I to
myself, that they cannot see into the hearts of one another!  How happy
had it been for me if I had been wife to a man of so much honesty, and
so much affection from the beginning!

Then it occurred to me, 'What an abominable creature am I!  and how is
this innocent gentleman going to be abused by me!  How little does he
think, that having divorced a whore, he is throwing himself into the
arms of another! that he is going to marry one that has lain with two
brothers, and has had three children by her own brother! one that was
born in Newgate, whose mother was a whore, and is now a transported
thief!  one that has lain with thirteen men, and has had a child since
he saw me!  Poor gentleman!' said I, 'what is he going to do?' After
this reproaching myself was over, it following thus: 'Well, if I must
be his wife, if it please God to give me grace, I'll be a true wife to
him, and love him suitably to the strange excess of his passion for me;
I will make him amends if possible, by what he shall see, for the
cheats and abuses I put upon him, which he does not see.'

He was impatient for my coming out of my chamber, but finding me long,
he went downstairs and talked with my landlord about the parson.

My landlord, an officious though well-meaning fellow, had sent away for
the neighbouring clergyman; and when my gentleman began to speak of it
to him, and talk of sending for him, 'Sir,' says he to him, 'my friend
is in the house'; so without any more words he brought them together.
When he came to the minister, he asked him if he would venture to marry
a couple of strangers that were both willing.  The parson said that Mr.
---- had said something to him of it; that he hoped it was no
clandestine business; that he seemed to be a grave gentleman, and he
supposed madam was not a girl, so that the consent of friends should be
wanted.  'To put you out of doubt of that,' says my gentleman, 'read
this paper'; and out he pulls the license.  'I am satisfied,' says the
minister; 'where is the lady?'  'You shall see her presently,' says my
gentleman.

When he had said thus he comes upstairs, and I was by that time come
out of my room; so he tells me the minister was below, and that he had
talked with him, and that upon showing him the license, he was free to
marry us with all his heart, 'but he asks to see you'; so he asked if I
would let him come up.

''Tis time enough,' said I, 'in the morning, is it not?'  'Why,' said
he, 'my dear, he seemed to scruple whether it was not some young girl
stolen from her parents, and I assured him we were both of age to
command our own consent; and that made him ask to see you.'  'Well,'
said I, 'do as you please'; so up they brings the parson, and a merry,
good sort of gentleman he was.  He had been told, it seems, that we had
met there by accident, that I came in the Chester coach, and my
gentleman in his own coach to meet me; that we were to have met last
night at Stony-Stratford, but that he could not reach so far.  'Well,
sir,' says the parson, 'every ill turn has some good in it.  The
disappointment, sir,' says he to my gentleman, 'was yours, and the good
turn is mine, for if you had met at Stony-Stratford I had not had the
honour to marry you.  Landlord, have you a Common Prayer Book?'

I started as if I had been frightened.  'Lord, sir,' says I, 'what do
you mean?  What, to marry in an inn, and at night too?' 'Madam,' says
the minister, 'if you will have it be in the church, you shall; but I
assure you your marriage will be as firm here as in the church; we are
not tied by the canons to marry nowhere but in the church; and if you
will have it in the church, it will be a public as a county fair; and
as for the time of day, it does not at all weigh in this case; our
princes are married in their chambers, and at eight or ten o'clock at
night.'

I was a great while before I could be persuaded, and pretended not to
be willing at all to be married but in the church.  But it was all
grimace; so I seemed at last to be prevailed on, and my landlord and
his wife and daughter were called up.  My landlord was father and clerk
and all together, and we were married, and very merry we were; though I
confess the self-reproaches which I had upon me before lay close to me,
and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me, which my
bridegroom took notice of, and endeavoured to encourage me, thinking,
poor man, that I had some little hesitations at the step I had taken so
hastily.

We enjoyed ourselves that evening completely, and yet all was kept so
private in the inn that not a servant in the house knew of it, for my
landlady and her daughter waited on me, and would not let any of the
maids come upstairs, except while we were at supper.  My landlady's
daughter I called my bridesmaid; and sending for a shopkeeper the next
morning, I gave the young woman a good suit of knots, as good as the
town would afford, and finding it was a lace-making town, I gave her
mother a piece of bone-lace for a head.

One reason that my landlord was so close was, that he was unwilling the
minister of the parish should hear of it; but for all that somebody
heard of it, so at that we had the bells set a-ringing the next morning
early, and the music, such as the town would afford, under our window;
but my landlord brazened it out, that we were married before we came
thither, only that, being his former guests, we would have our
wedding-supper at his house.

We could not find in our hearts to stir the next day; for, in short,
having been disturbed by the bells in the morning, and having perhaps
not slept overmuch before, we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in
bed till almost twelve o'clock.

I begged my landlady that we might not have any more music in the town,
nor ringing of bells, and she managed it so well that we were very
quiet; but an odd passage interrupted all my mirth for a good while.
The great room of the house looked into the street, and my new spouse
being belowstairs, I had walked to the end of the room; and it being a
pleasant, warm day, I had opened the window, and was standing at it for
some air, when I saw three gentlemen come by on horseback and go into
an inn just against us.

It was not to be concealed, nor was it so doubtful as to leave me any
room to question it, but the second of the three was my Lancashire
husband.  I was frightened to death; I never was in such a
consternation in my life; I though I should have sunk into the ground;
my blood ran chill in my veins, and I trembled as if I had been in a
cold fit of ague.  I say, there was no room to question the truth of
it; I knew his clothes, I knew his horse, and I knew his face.

The first sensible reflect I made was, that my husband was not by to
see my disorder, and that I was very glad of it.  The gentlemen had not
been long in the house but they came to the window of their room, as is
usual; but my window was shut, you may be sure.  However, I could not
keep from peeping at them, and there I saw him again, heard him call
out to one of the servants of the house for something he wanted, and
received all the terrifying confirmations of its being the same person
that were possible to be had.

My next concern was to know, if possible, what was his business there;
but that was impossible.  Sometimes my imagination formed an idea of
one frightful thing, sometimes of another; sometime I thought he had
discovered me, and was come to upbraid me with ingratitude and breach
of honour; and every moment I fancied he was coming up the stairs to
insult me; and innumerable fancies came into my head of what was never
in his head, nor ever could be, unless the devil had revealed it to him.

I remained in this fright nearly two hours, and scarce ever kept my eye
from the window or door of the inn where they were.  At last, hearing a
great clatter in the passage of their inn, I ran to the window, and, to
my great satisfaction, saw them all three go out again and travel on
westward.  Had they gone towards London, I should have been still in a
fright, lest I should meet him on the road again, and that he should
know me; but he went the contrary way, and so I was eased of that
disorder.

We resolved to be going the next day, but about six o'clock at night we
were alarmed with a great uproar in the street, and people riding as if
they had been out of their wits; and what was it but a hue-and-cry
after three highwaymen that had robbed two coaches and some other
travellers near Dunstable Hill, and notice had, it seems, been given
that they had been seen at Brickhill at such a house, meaning the house
where those gentlemen had been.

The house was immediately beset and searched, but there were witnesses
enough that the gentlemen had been gone over three hours.  The crowd
having gathered about, we had the news presently; and I was heartily
concerned now another way.  I presently told the people of the house,
that I durst to say those were not the persons, for that I knew one of
the gentlemen to be a very honest person, and of a good estate in
Lancashire.

The constable who came with the hue-and-cry was immediately informed of
this, and came over to me to be satisfied from my own mouth, and I
assured him that I saw the three gentlemen as I was at the window; that
I saw them afterwards at the windows of the room they dined in; that I
saw them afterwards take horse, and I could assure him I knew one of
them to be such a man, that he was a gentleman of a very good estate,
and an undoubted character in Lancashire, from whence I was just now
upon my journey.

The assurance with which I delivered this gave the mob gentry a check,
and gave the constable such satisfaction, that he immediately sounded a
retreat, told his people these were not the men, but that he had an
account they were very honest gentlemen; and so they went all back
again.  What the truth of the matter was I knew not, but certain it was
that the coaches were robbed at Dunstable Hill, and #560 in money
taken; besides, some of the lace merchants that always travel that way
had been visited too.  As to the three gentlemen, that remains to be
explained hereafter.

Well, this alarm stopped us another day, though my spouse was for
travelling, and told me that it was always safest travelling after a
robbery, for that the thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when
they had alarmed the country; but I was afraid and uneasy, and indeed
principally lest my old acquaintance should be upon the road still, and
should chance to see me.

I never lived four pleasanter days together in my life.  I was a mere
bride all this while, and my new spouse strove to make me entirely easy
in everything.  Oh could this state of life have continued, how had all
my past troubles been forgot, and my future sorrows avoided!  But I had
a past life of a most wretched kind to account for, some if it in this
world as well as in another.

We came away the fifth day; and my landlord, because he saw me uneasy,
mounted himself, his son, and three honest country fellows with good
firearms, and, without telling us of it, followed the coach, and would
see us safe into Dunstable.  We could do no less than treat them very
handsomely at Dunstable, which cost my spouse about ten or twelve
shillings, and something he gave the men for their time too, but my
landlord would take nothing for himself.

This was the most happy contrivance for me that could have fallen out;
for had I come to London unmarried, I must either have come to him for
the first night's entertainment, or have discovered to him that I had
not one acquaintance in the whole city of London that could receive a
poor bride for the first night's lodging with her spouse.  But now,
being an old married woman, I made no scruple of going directly home
with him, and there I took possession at once of a house well
furnished, and a husband in very good circumstances, so that I had a
prospect of a very happy life, if I knew how to manage it; and I had
leisure to consider of the real value of the life I was likely to live.
How different it was to be from the loose ungoverned part I had acted
before, and how much happier a life of virtue and sobriety is, than
that which we call a life of pleasure.

Oh had this particular scene of life lasted, or had I learned from that
time I enjoyed it, to have tasted the true sweetness of it, and had I
not fallen into that poverty which is the sure bane of virtue, how
happy had I been, not only here, but perhaps for ever!  for while I
lived thus, I was really a penitent for all my life past.  I looked
back on it with abhorrence, and might truly be said to hate myself for
it.  I often reflected how my lover at the Bath, struck at the hand of
God, repented and abandoned me, and refused to see me any more, though
he loved me to an extreme; but I, prompted by that worst of devils,
poverty, returned to the vile practice, and made the advantage of what
they call a handsome face to be the relief to my necessities, and
beauty be a pimp to vice.

Now I seemed landed in a safe harbour, after the stormy voyage of life
past was at an end, and I began to be thankful for my deliverance.  I
sat many an hour by myself, and wept over the remembrance of past
follies, and the dreadful extravagances of a wicked life, and sometimes
I flattered myself that I had sincerely repented.

But there are temptations which it is not in the power of human nature
to resist, and few know what would be their case if driven to the same
exigencies.  As covetousness is the root of all evil, so poverty is, I
believe, the worst of all snares.  But I waive that discourse till I
come to an experiment.

I lived with this husband with the utmost tranquillity; he was a quiet,
sensible, sober man; virtuous, modest, sincere, and in his business
diligent and just.  His business was in a narrow compass, and his
income sufficient to a plentiful way of living in the ordinary way.  I
do not say to keep an equipage, and make a figure, as the world calls
it, nor did I expect it, or desire it; for as I abhorred the levity and
extravagance of my former life, so I chose now to live retired, frugal,
and within ourselves.  I kept no company, made no visits; minded my
family, and obliged my husband; and this kind of life became a pleasure
to me.

We lived in an uninterrupted course of ease and content for five years,
when a sudden blow from an almost invisible hand blasted all my
happiness, and turned me out into the world in a condition the reverse
of all that had been before it.

My husband having trusted one of his fellow-clerks with a sum of money,
too much for our fortunes to bear the loss of, the clerk failed, and
the loss fell very heavy on my husband, yet it was not so great neither
but that, if he had had spirit and courage to have looked his
misfortunes in the face, his credit was so good that, as I told him, he
would easily recover it; for to sink under trouble is to double the
weight, and he that will die in it, shall die in it.

It was in vain to speak comfortably to him; the wound had sunk too
deep; it was a stab that touched the vitals; he grew melancholy and
disconsolate, and from thence lethargic, and died.  I foresaw the blow,
and was extremely oppressed in my mind, for I saw evidently that if he
died I was undone.

I had had two children by him and no more, for, to tell the truth, it
began to be time for me to leave bearing children, for I was now
eight-and-forty, and I suppose if he had lived I should have had no
more.

I was now left in a dismal and disconsolate case indeed, and in several
things worse than ever.  First, it was past the flourishing time with
me when I might expect to be courted for a mistress; that agreeable
part had declined some time, and the ruins only appeared of what had
been; and that which was worse than all this, that I was the most
dejected, disconsolate creature alive.  I that had encouraged my
husband, and endeavoured to support his spirits under his trouble,
could not support my own; I wanted that spirit in trouble which I told
him was so necessary to him for bearing the burthen.

But my case was indeed deplorable, for I was left perfectly friendless
and helpless, and the loss my husband had sustained had reduced his
circumstances so low, that though indeed I was not in debt, yet I could
easily foresee that what was left would not support me long; that while
it wasted daily for subsistence, I had not way to increase it one
shilling, so that it would be soon all spent, and then I saw nothing
before me but the utmost distress; and this represented itself so
lively to my thoughts, that it seemed as if it was come, before it was
really very near; also my very apprehensions doubled the misery, for I
fancied every sixpence that I paid for a loaf of bread was the last
that I had in the world, and that to-morrow I was to fast, and be
starved to death.

In this distress I had no assistant, no friend to comfort or advise me;
I sat and cried and tormented myself night and day, wringing my hands,
and sometimes raving like a distracted woman; and indeed I have often
wondered it had not affected my reason, for I had the vapours to such a
degree, that my understanding was sometimes quite lost in fancies and
imaginations.

I lived two years in this dismal condition, wasting that little I had,
weeping continually over my dismal circumstances, and, as it were, only
bleeding to death, without the least hope or prospect of help from God
or man; and now I had cried too long, and so often, that tears were, as
I might say, exhausted, and I began to be desperate, for I grew poor
apace.

For a little relief I had put off my house and took lodgings; and as I
was reducing my living, so I sold off most of my goods, which put a
little money in my pocket, and I lived near a year upon that, spending
very sparingly, and eking things out to the utmost; but still when I
looked before me, my very heart would sink within me at the inevitable
approach of misery and want.  Oh let none read this part without
seriously reflecting on the circumstances of a desolate state, and how
they would grapple with mere want of friends and want of bread; it will
certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only, but of
looking up to heaven for support, and of the wise man's prayer, 'Give
me not poverty, lest I steal.'

Let them remember that a time of distress is a time of dreadful
temptation, and all the strength to resist is taken away;  poverty
presses, the soul is made desperate by distress, and what can be done?
It was one evening, when being brought, as I may say, to the last gasp,
I think I may truly say I was distracted and raving, when prompted by I
know not what spirit, and, as it were, doing I did not know what or
why, I dressed me (for I had still pretty good clothes) and went out.
I am very sure I had no manner of design in my head when I went out; I
neither knew nor considered where to go, or on what business; but as
the devil carried me out and laid his bait for me, so he brought me, to
be sure, to the place, for I knew not whither I was going or what I did.

Wandering thus about, I knew not whither, I passed by an apothecary's
shop in Leadenhall Street, when I saw lie on a stool just before the
counter a little bundle wrapped in a white cloth; beyond it stood a
maid-servant with her back to it, looking towards the top of the shop,
where the apothecary's apprentice, as I suppose, was standing upon the
counter, with his back also to the door, and a candle in his hand,
looking and reaching up to the upper shelf for something he wanted, so
that both were engaged mighty earnestly, and nobody else in the shop.

This was the bait; and the devil, who I said laid the snare, as readily
prompted me as if he had spoke, for I remember, and shall never forget
it, 'twas like a voice spoken to me over my shoulder, 'Take the bundle;
be quick; do it this moment.'  It was no sooner said but I stepped into
the shop, and with my back to the wench, as if I had stood up for a
cart that was going by, I put my hand behind me and took the bundle,
and went off with it, the maid or the fellow not perceiving me, or any
one else.

It is impossible to express the horror of my soul all the while I did
it.  When I went away I had no heart to run, or scarce to mend my pace.
I crossed the street indeed, and went down the first turning I came to,
and I think it was a street that went through into Fenchurch Street.
From thence I crossed and turned through so many ways and turnings,
that I could never tell which way it was, not where I went; for I felt
not the ground I stepped on, and the farther I was out of danger, the
faster I went, till, tired and out of breath, I was forced to sit down
on a little bench at a door, and then I began to recover, and found I
was got into Thames Street, near Billingsgate.  I rested me a little
and went on; my blood was all in a fire; my heart beat as if I was in a
sudden fright.  In short, I was under such a surprise that I still knew
not wither I was going, or what to do.

After I had tired myself thus with walking a long way about, and so
eagerly, I began to consider and make home to my lodging, where I came
about nine o'clock at night.

When the bundle was made up for, or on what occasion laid where I found
it, I knew not, but when I came to open it I found there was a suit of
childbed-linen in it, very good and almost new, the lace very fine;
there was a silver porringer of a pint, a small silver mug and six
spoons, with some other linen, a good smock, and three silk
handkerchiefs, and in the mug, wrapped up in a paper, 18s. 6d. in money.

All the while I was opening these things I was under such dreadful
impressions of fear, and I such terror of mind, though I was perfectly
safe, that I cannot express the manner of it.  I sat me down, and cried
most vehemently.  'Lord,' said I, 'what am I now? a thief!  Why, I
shall be taken next time, and be carried to Newgate and be tried for my
life!'  And with that I cried again a long time, and I am sure, as poor
as I was, if I had durst for fear, I would certainly have carried the
things back again; but that went off after a while.  Well, I went to
bed for that night, but slept little; the horror of the fact was upon
my mind, and I knew not what I said or did all night, and all the next
day.  Then I was impatient to hear some news of the loss; and would
fain know how it was, whether they were a poor body's goods, or a rich.
'Perhaps,' said I, 'it may be some poor widow like me, that had packed
up these goods to go and sell them for a little bread for herself and a
poor child, and are now starving and breaking their hearts for want of
that little they would have fetched.'  And this thought tormented me
worse than all the rest, for three or four days' time.

But my own distresses silenced all these reflections, and the prospect
of my own starving, which grew every day more frightful to me, hardened
my heart by degrees.  It was then particularly heavy upon my mind, that
I had been reformed, and had, as I hoped, repented of all my past
wickedness; that I had lived a sober, grave, retired life for several
years, but now I should be driven by the dreadful necessity of my
circumstances to the gates of destruction, soul and body; and two or
three times I fell upon my knees, praying to God, as well as I could,
for deliverance; but I cannot but say, my prayers had no hope in them.
I knew not what to do; it was all fear without, and dark within; and I
reflected on my past life as not sincerely repented of, that Heaven was
now beginning to punish me on this side the grave, and would make me as
miserable as I had been wicked.

Had I gone on here I had perhaps been a true penitent; but I had an
evil counsellor within, and he was continually prompting me to relieve
myself by the worst means; so one evening he tempted me again, by the
same wicked impulse that had said 'Take that bundle,' to go out again
and seek for what might happen.

I went out now by daylight, and wandered about I knew not whither, and
in search of I knew not what, when the devil put a snare in my way of a
dreadful nature indeed, and such a one as I have never had before or
since.  Going through Aldersgate Street, there was a pretty little
child who had been at a dancing-school, and was going home, all alone;
and my prompter, like a true devil, set me upon this innocent creature.
I talked to it, and it prattled to me again, and I took it by the hand
and led it along till I came to a paved alley that goes into
Bartholomew Close, and I led it in there.  The child said that was not
its way home.  I said, 'Yes, my dear, it is; I'll show you the way
home.' The child had a little necklace on of gold beads, and I had my
eye upon that, and in the dark of the alley I stooped, pretending to
mend the child's clog that was loose, and took off her necklace, and
the child never felt it, and so led the child on again.  Here, I say,
the devil put me upon killing the child in the dark alley, that it
might not cry, but the very thought frighted me so that I was ready to
drop down; but I turned the child about and bade it go back again, for
that was not its way home.  The child said, so she would, and I went
through into Bartholomew Close, and then turned round to another
passage that goes into St. John Street; then, crossing into Smithfield,
went down Chick Lane and into Field Lane to Holborn Bridge, when,
mixing with the crowd of people usually passing there, it was not
possible to have been found out; and thus I enterprised my second sally
into the world.

The thoughts of this booty put out all the thoughts of the first, and
the reflections I had made wore quickly off; poverty, as I have said,
hardened my heart, and my own necessities made me regardless of
anything.  The last affair left no great concern upon me, for as I did
the poor child no harm, I only said to myself, I had given the parents
a just reproof for their negligence in leaving the poor little lamb to
come home by itself, and it would teach them to take more care of it
another time.

This string of beads was worth about twelve or fourteen pounds.  I
suppose it might have been formerly the mother's, for it was too big
for the child's wear, but that perhaps the vanity of the mother, to
have her child look fine at the dancing-school, had made her let the
child wear it; and no doubt the child had a maid sent to take care of
it, but she, careless jade, was taken up perhaps with some fellow that
had met her by the way, and so the poor baby wandered till it fell into
my hands.

However, I did the child no harm; I did not so much as fright it, for I
had a great many tender thoughts about me yet, and did nothing but
what, as I may say, mere necessity drove me to.

I had a great many adventures after this, but I was young in the
business, and did not know how to manage, otherwise than as the devil
put things into my head; and indeed he was seldom backward to me.  One
adventure I had which was very lucky to me.  I was going through
Lombard Street in the dusk of the evening, just by the end of Three
King court, when on a sudden comes a fellow running by me as swift as
lightning, and throws a bundle that was in his hand, just behind me, as
I stood up against the corner of the house at the turning into the
alley.  Just as he threw it in he said, 'God bless you, mistress, let
it lie there a little,' and away he runs swift as the wind.  After him
comes two more, and immediately a young fellow without his hat, crying
'Stop thief!' and after him two or three more.  They pursued the two
last fellows so close, that they were forced to drop what they had got,
and one of them was taken into the bargain, and other got off free.

I stood stock-still all this while, till they came back, dragging the
poor fellow they had taken, and lugging the things they had found,
extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the booty and taken
the thief; and thus they passed by me, for I looked only like one who
stood up while the crowd was gone.

uzzaed, and wished them a
good journey; some damned and cursed those that had brought them to
it--that is, meaning the evidence, or prosecutors--many pitying them,
and some few, but very few, praying for them.

There was hardly room for so much composure of mind as was required for
me to bless the merciful Providence that had, as it were, snatched me
out of the jaws of this destruction.  I remained, as it were, dumb and
silent, overcome with the sense of it, and not able to express what I
had in my heart; for the passions on such occasions as these are
certainly so agitated as not to be able presently to regulate their own
motions.

All the while the poor condemned creatures were preparing to their
death, and the ordinary, as they call him, was busy with them,
disposing them to submit to their sentence--I say, all this while I was
seized with a fit of trembling, as much as I could have been if I had
been in the same condition, as to be sure the day before I expected to
be; I was so violently agitated by this surprising fit, that I shook as
if it had been in the cold fit of an ague, so that I could not speak or
look but like one distracted.  As soon as they were all put into carts
and gone, which, however, I had not courage enough to see--I say, as
soon as they were gone, I fell into a fit of crying involuntarily, and
without design, but as a mere distemper, and yet so violent, and it
held me so long, that I knew not what course to take, nor could I stop,
or put a check to it, no, not with all the strength and courage I had.

This fit of crying held me near two hours, and, as I believe, held me
till they were all out of the world, and then a most humble, penitent,
serious kind of joy succeeded; a real transport it was, or passion of
joy and thankfulness, but still unable to give vent to it by words, and
in this I continued most part of the day.

In the evening the good minister visited me again, and then fell to his
usual good discourses.  He congratulated my having a space yet allowed
me for repentance, whereas the state of those six poor creatures was
determined, and they were now past the offers of salvation; he
earnestly pressed me to retain the same sentiments of the things of
life that I had when I had a view of eternity; and at the end of all
told me I should not conclude that all was over, that a reprieve was
not a pardon, that he could not yet answer for the effects of it;
however, I had this mercy, that I had more time given me, and that it
was my business to improve that time.

This discourse, though very seasonable, left a kind of sadness on my
heart, as if I might expect the affair would have a tragical issue
still, which, however, he had no certainty of; and I did not indeed, at
that time, question him about it, he having said that he would do his
utmost to bring it to a good end, and that he hoped he might, but he
would not have me be secure; and the consequence proved that he had
reason for what he said.

It was about a fortnight after this that I had some just apprehensions
that I should be included in the next dead warrant at the ensuing
sessions; and it was not without great difficulty, and at last a humble
petition for transportation, that I avoided it, so ill was I beholding
to fame, and so prevailing was the fatal report of being an old
offender; though in that they did not do me strict justice, for I was
not in the sense of the law an old offender, whatever I was in the eye
of the judge, for I had never been before them in a judicial way
before; so the judges could not charge me with being an old offender,
but the Recorder was pleased to represent my case as he thought fit.

I had now a certainty of life indeed, but with the hard conditions of
being ordered for transportation, which indeed was hard condition in
itself, but not when comparatively considered; and therefore I shall
make no comments upon the sentence, nor upon the choice I was put to.
We shall all choose anything rather than death, especially when 'tis
attended with an uncomfortable prospect beyond it, which was my case.

The good minister, whose interest, though a stranger to me, had
obtained me the reprieve, mourned sincerely for this part.  He was in
hopes, he said, that I should have ended my days under the influence of
good instruction, that I should not have been turned loose again among
such a wretched crew as they generally are, who are thus sent abroad,
where, as he said, I must have more than ordinary secret assistance
from the grace of God, if I did not turn as wicked again as ever.

I have not for a good while mentioned my governess, who had during
most, if not all, of this part been dangerously sick, and being in as
near a view of death by her disease as I was by my sentence, was a
great penitent--I say, I have not mentioned her, nor indeed did I see
her in all this time; but being now recovering, and just able to come
abroad, she came to see me.

I told her my condition, and what a different flux and reflux of tears
and hopes I had been agitated with; I told her what I had escaped, and
upon what terms; and she was present when the minister expressed his
fears of my relapsing into wickedness upon my falling into the wretched
companies that are generally transported.  Indeed I had a melancholy
reflection upon it in my own mind, for I knew what a dreadful gang was
always sent away together, and I said to my governess that the good
minister's fears were not without cause.  'Well, well,' says  she, 'but
I hope you will not be tempted with such a horrid example as that.' And
as soon as the minister was gone, she told me she would not have me
discouraged, for perhaps ways and means might be found out to dispose
of me in a particular way, by myself, of which she would talk further
to me afterward.

I looked earnestly at her, and I thought she looked more cheerful than
she usually had done, and I entertained immediately a thousand notions
of being delivered, but could not for my life image the methods, or
think of one that was in the least feasible; but I was too much
concerned in it to let her go from me without explaining herself,
which, though she was very loth to do, yet my importunity prevailed,
and, while I was still pressing, she answered me in a few words, thus:
'Why, you have money, have you not?  Did you ever know one in your life
that was transported and had a hundred pounds in his pocket, I'll
warrant you, child?' says she.

I understood her presently, but told her I would leave all that to her,
but I saw no room to hope for anything but a strict execution of the
order, and as it was a severity that was esteemed a mercy, there was no
doubt but it would be strictly observed.  She said no more but this:
'We will try what can be done,' and so we parted for that night.

I lay in the prison near fifteen weeks after this order for
transportation was signed.  What the reason of it was, I know not, but
at the end of this time I was put on board of a ship in the Thames, and
with me a gang of thirteen as hardened vile creatures as ever Newgate
produced in my time; and it would really well take up a history longer
than mine to describe the degrees of impudence and audacious villainy
that those thirteen were arrived to, and the manner of their behaviour
in the voyage; of which I have a very diverting account by me, which
the captain of the ship who carried them over gave me the minutes of,
and which he caused his mate to write down at large.

It may perhaps be thought trifling to enter here into a relation of all
the little incidents which attended me in this interval of my
circumstances; I mean, between the final order of my transportation and
the time of my going on board the ship; and I am too near the end of my
story to allow room for it; but something relating to me and my
Lancashire husband I must not omit.

He had, as I have observed already, been carried from the master's side
of the ordinary prison into the press-yard, with three of his comrades,
for they found another to add to them after some time; here, for what
reason I knew not, they were kept in custody without being brought to
trial almost three months.  It seems they found means to bribe or buy
off some of those who were expected to come in against them, and they
wanted evidence for some time to convict them.  After some puzzle on
this account, at first they made a shift to get proof enough against
two of them to carry them off; but the other two, of which my
Lancashire husband was one, lay still in suspense.  They had, I think,
one positive evidence against each of them, but the law strictly
obliging them to have two witnesses, they could make nothing of it.
Yet it seems they were resolved not to part with the men neither, not
doubting but a further evidence would at last come in; and in order to
this, I think publication was made, that such prisoners being taken,
any one that had been robbed by them might come to the prison and see
them.

I took this opportunity to satisfy my curiosity, pretending that I had
been robbed in the Dunstable coach, and that I would go to see the two
highwaymen.  But when I came into the press-yard, I so disguised
myself, and muffled my face up so, that he could see little of me, and
consequently knew nothing of who I was; and when I came back, I said
publicly that I knew them very well.

Immediately it was rumoured all over the prison that Moll Flanders
would turn evidence against one of the highwaymen, and that I was to
come off by it from the sentence of transportation.

They heard of it, and immediately my husband desired to see this Mrs.
Flanders that knew him so well, and was to be an evidence against him;
and accordingly I had leave given to go to him.  I dressed myself up as
well as the best clothes that I suffered myself ever to appear in there
would allow me, and went to the press-yard, but had for some time a
hood over my face.  He said little to me at first, but asked me if I
knew him.  I told him, Yes, very well; but as I concealed my face, so I
counterfeited my voice, that he had not the least guess at who I was.
He asked me where I had seen him.  I told him between Dunstable and
Brickhill; but turning to the keeper that stood by, I asked if I might
not be admitted to talk with him alone.  He said Yes, yes, as much as I
pleased, and so very civilly withdrew.

As soon as he was gone, I had shut the door, I threw off my hood, and
bursting out into tears, 'My dear,' says I, 'do you not know me?'  He
turned pale, and stood speechless, like one thunderstruck, and, not
able to conquer the surprise, said no more but this, 'Let me sit down';
and sitting down by a table, he laid his elbow upon the table, and
leaning his head on his hand, fixed his eyes on the ground as one
stupid.  I cried so vehemently, on the other hand, that it was a good
while ere I could speak any more; but after I had given some vent to my
passion by tears, I repeated the same words, 'My dear, do you not know
me?'  At which he answered, Yes, and said no more a good while.

After some time continuing in the surprise, as above, he cast up his
eyes towards me and said, 'How could you be so cruel?' I did not
readily understand what he meant; and I answered, 'How can you call me
cruel?  What have I been cruel to you in?' 'To come to me,' says he,
'in such a place as this, is it not to insult me?  I have not robbed
you, at least not on the highway.'

I perceived by this that he knew nothing of the miserable circumstances
I was in, and thought that, having got some intelligence of his being
there, I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me.  But I had too
much to say to him to be affronted, and told him in few words, that I
was far from coming to insult him, but at best I came to condole
mutually; that he would be easily satisfied that I had no such view,
when I should tell him that my condition was worse than his, and that
many ways.  He looked a little concerned at the general expression of
my condition being worse than his, but, with a kind smile, looked a
little wildly, and said, 'How can that be?  When you see me fettered,
and in Newgate, and two of my companions executed already, can you can
your condition is worse than mine?'

'Come, my dear,' says I, 'we have a long piece of work to do, if I
should be to relate, or you to hear, my unfortunate history; but if you
are disposed to hear it, you will soon conclude with me that my
condition is worse than yours.'  'How is that possible,' says he again,
'when I expect to be cast for my life the very next sessions?'  'Yes,
says I, ''tis very possible, when I shall tell you that I have been
cast for my life three sessions ago, and am under sentence of death; is
not my case worse than yours?'

Then indeed, he stood silent again, like one struck dumb, and after a
while he starts up.  'Unhappy couple!' says he.  'How can this be
possible?'  I took him by the hand.  'Come, my dear,' said I, 'sit
down, and let us compare our sorrows.  I am a prisoner in this very
house, and in much worse circumstances than you, and you will be
satisfied I do not come to insult you, when I tell you the
particulars.'  And with this we sat down together, and I told him so
much of my story as I thought was convenient, bringing it at last to my
being reduced to great poverty, and representing myself as fallen into
some company that led me to relieve my distresses by way that I had
been utterly unacquainted with, and that they making an attempt at a
tradesman's house, I was seized upon for having been but just at the
door, the maid-servant pulling me in; that I neither had broke any lock
nor taken anything away, and that notwithstanding that, I was brought
in guilty and sentenced to die; but that the judges, having been made
sensible of the hardship of my circumstances, had obtained leave to
remit the sentence upon my consenting to be transported.

I told him I fared the worse for being taken in the prison for one Moll
Flanders, who was a famous successful thief, that all of them had heard
of, but none of them had ever seen; but that, as he knew well, was none
of my name.  But I placed all to the account of my ill fortune, and
that under this name I was dealt with as an old offender, though this
was the first thing they had ever known of me.  I gave him a long
particular of things that had befallen me since I saw him, but I told
him if I had seen him since he might think I had, and then gave him an
account how I had seen him at Brickhill; how furiously he was pursued,
and how, by giving an account that I knew him, and that he was a very
honest gentleman, one Mr. ----, the hue-and-cry was stopped, and the
high constable went back again.

He listened most attentively to all my story, and smiled at most of the
particulars, being all of them petty matters, and infinitely below what
he had been at the head of; but when I came to the story of Brickhill,
he was surprised.  'And was it you, my dear,' said he, 'that gave the
check to the mob that was at our heels there, at Brickhill?'  'Yes,'
said I, 'it was I indeed.'  And then I told him the particulars which I
had observed him there.  'Why, then,' said he, 'it was you that saved
my life at that time, and I am glad I owe my life to you, for I will
pay the debt to you now, and I'll deliver you from the present
condition you are in, or I will die in the attempt.'

I told him, by no means; it was a risk too great, not worth his running
the hazard of, and for a life not worth his saving.  'Twas no matter
for that, he said, it was a life worth all the world to him; a life
that had given him a new life; 'for,' says he, 'I was never in real
danger of being taken, but that time, till the last minute when I was
taken.'  Indeed, he told me his danger then lay in his believing he had
not been pursued that way; for they had gone from Hockey quite another
way, and had come over the enclosed country into Brickhill, not by the
road, and were sure they had not been seen by anybody.

Here he gave me a long history of his life, which indeed would make a
very strange history, and be infinitely diverting.  He told me he took
to the road about twelve years before he married me; that the woman
which called him brother was not really his sister, or any kin to him,
but one that belonged to their gang, and who, keeping correspondence
with him, lived always in town, having good store of acquaintance; that
she gave them a perfect intelligence of persons going out of town, and
that they had made several good booties by her correspondence; that she
thought she had fixed a fortune for him when she brought me to him, but
happened to be disappointed, which he really could not blame her for;
that if it had been his good luck that I had had the estate, which she
was informed I had, he had resolved to leave off the road and live a
retired, sober live but never to appear in public till some general
pardon had been passed, or till he could, for money, have got his name
into some particular pardon, that so he might have been perfectly easy;
but that, as it had proved otherwise, he was obliged to put off his
equipage and take up the old trade again.

He gave me a long account of some of his adventures, and particularly
one when he robbed the West Chester coaches near Lichfield, when he got
a very great booty; and after that, how he robbed five graziers, in the
west, going to Burford Fair in Wiltshire to buy sheep.  He told me he
got so much money on those two occasions, that if he had known where to
have found me, he would certainly have embraced my proposal of going
with me to Virginia, or to have settled in a plantation on some other
parts of the English colonies in America.

He told me he wrote two or three letters to me, directed according to
my order, but heard nothing from me.  This I indeed knew to be true,
but the letters coming to my hand in the time of my latter husband, I
could do nothing in it, and therefore chose to give no answer, that so
he might rather believe they had miscarried.

Being thus disappointed, he said, he carried on the old trade ever
since, though when he had gotten so much money, he said, he did not run
such desperate risks as he did before.  Then he gave me some account of
several hard and desperate encounters which he had with gentlemen on
the road, who parted too hardly with their money, and showed me some
wounds he had received; and he had one or two very terrible wounds
indeed, as particularly one by a pistol bullet, which broke his arm,
and another with a sword, which ran him quite through the body, but
that missing his vitals, he was cured again; one of his comrades having
kept with him so faithfully, and so friendly, as that he assisted him
in riding near eighty miles before his arm was set, and then got a
surgeon in a considerable city, remote from that place where it was
done, pretending they were gentlemen travelling towards Carlisle and
that they had been attacked on the road by highwaymen, and that one of
them had shot him into the arm and broke the bone.

This, he said, his friend managed so well, that they were not suspected
at all, but lay still till he was perfectly cured.  He gave me so many
distinct accounts of his adventures, that it is with great reluctance
that I decline the relating them; but I consider that this is my own
story, not his.

I then inquired into the circumstances of his present case at that
time, and what it was he expected when he came to be tried.  He told me
that they had no evidence against him, or but very little; for that of
three robberies, which they were all charged with, it was his good
fortune that he was but in one of them, and that there was but one
witness to be had for that fact, which was not sufficient, but that it
was expected some others would come in against him; that he thought
indeed, when he first saw me, that I had been one that came of that
errand; but that if somebody came in against him, he hoped he should be
cleared; that he had had some intimation, that if he would submit to
transport himself, he might be admitted to it without a trial, but that
he could not think of it with any temper, and thought he could much
easier submit to be hanged.

I blamed him for that, and told him I blamed him on two accounts;
first, because if he was transported, there might be a hundred ways for
him that was a gentleman, and a bold enterprising man, to find his way
back again, and perhaps some ways and means to come back before he
went.  He smiled at that part, and said he should like the last the
best of the two, for he had a kind of horror upon his mind at his being
sent over to the plantations, as Romans sent condemned slaves to work
in the mines; that he thought the passage into another state, let it be
what it would, much more tolerable at the gallows, and that this was
the general notion of all the gentlemen who were driven by the exigence
of their fortunes to take the road; that at the place of execution
there was at least an end of all the miseries of the present state, and
as for what was to follow, a man was, in his opinion, as likely to
repent sincerely in the last fortnight of his life, under the pressures
and agonies of a jail and the condemned hole, as he would ever be in
the woods and wilderness of America; that servitude and hard labour
were things gentlemen could never stoop to; that it was but the way to
force them to be their own executioners afterwards, which was much
worse; and that therefore he could not have any patience when he did
but think of being transported.

I used the utmost of my endeavour to persuade him, and joined that
known woman's rhetoric to it--I mean, that of tears.  I told him the
infamy of a public execution was certainly a greater pressure upon the
spirits of a gentleman than any of the mortifications that he could
meet with abroad could be; that he had at least in the other a chance
for his life, whereas here he had none at all; that it was the easiest
thing in the world for him to manage the captain of a ship, who were,
generally speaking, men of good-humour and some gallantry; and a small
matter of conduct, especially if there was any money to be had, would
make way for him to buy himself off when he came to Virginia.

He looked wistfully at me, and I thought I guessed at what he meant,
that is to say, that he had no money; but I was mistaken, his meaning
was another way.  'You hinted just now, my dear,' said he, 'that there
might be a way of coming back before I went, by which I understood you
that it might be possible to buy it off here.  I had rather give #200
to prevent going, than #100 to be set at liberty when I came there.'
'That is, my dear,' said I, 'because you do not know the place so well
as I do.' 'That may be,' said he; 'and yet I believe, as well as you
know it, you would do the same, unless it is because, as you told me,
you have a mother there.'

I told him, as to my mother, it was next to impossible but that she
must be dead many years before; and as for any other relations that I
might have there, I knew them not now; that since the misfortunes I had
been under had reduced me to the condition I had been in for some
years, I had not kept up any correspondence with them; and that he
would easily believe, I should find but a cold reception from them if I
should be put to make my first visit in the condition of a transported
felon; that therefore, if I went thither, I resolved not to see them;
but that I had many views in going there, if it should be my fate,
which took off all the uneasy part of it; and if he found himself
obliged to go also, I should easily instruct him how to manage himself,
so as never to go a servant at all, especially since I found he was not
destitute of money, which was the only friend in such a condition.

He smiled, and said he did not tell me he had money.  I took him up
short, and told him I hoped he did not understand by my speaking, that
I should expect any supply from him if he had money; that, on the other
hand, though I had not a great deal, yet I did not want, and while I
had any I would rather add to him than weaken him in that article,
seeing, whatever he had, I knew in the case of transportation he would
have occasion of it all.

He expressed himself in a most tender manner upon that head.  He told
me what money he had was not a great deal, but that he would never hide
any of it from me if I wanted it, and that he assured me he did not
speak with any such apprehensions; that he was only intent upon what I
had hinted to him before he went; that here he knew what to do with
himself, but that there he should be the most ignorant, helpless wretch
alive.

I told him he frighted and terrified himself with that which had no
terror in it; that if he had money, as I was glad to hear he had, he
might not only avoid the servitude supposed to be the consequence of
transportation, but begin the world upon a new foundation, and that
such a one as he could not fail of success in, with the common
application usual in such cases; that he could not but call to mind
that is was what I had recommended to him many years before and had
proposed it for our mutual subsistence and restoring our fortunes in
the world; and I would tell him now, that to convince him both of the
certainty of it and of my being fully acquainted with the method, and
also fully satisfied in the probability of success, he should first see
me deliver myself from the necessity of going over at all, and then
that I would go with him freely, and of my own choice, and perhaps
carry enough with me to satisfy him that I did not offer it for want of
being able to live without assistance from him, but that I thought our
mutual misfortunes had been such as were sufficient to reconcile us
both to quitting this part of the world, and living where nobody could
upbraid us with what was past, or we be in any dread of a prison, and
without agonies of a condemned hole to drive us to it; this where we
should look back on all our past disasters with infinite satisfaction,
when we should consider that our enemies should entirely forget us, and
that we should live as new people in a new world, nobody having
anything to say to us, or we to them.

I pressed this home to him with so many arguments, and answered all his
own passionate objections so effectually that he embraced me, and told
me I treated him with such sincerity and affection as overcame him;
that he would take my advice, and would strive to submit to his fate in
hope of having the comfort of my assistance, and of so faithful a
counsellor and such a companion in his misery.  But still he put me in
mind of what I had mentioned before, namely, that there might be some
way to get off before he went, and that it might be possible to avoid
going at all, which he said would be much better.  I told him he should
see, and be fully satisfied, that I would do my utmost in that part
too, and if it did not succeed, yet that I would make good the rest.

We parted after this long conference with such testimonies of kindness
and affection as I thought were equal, if not superior, to that at our
parting at Dunstable; and now I saw more plainly than before, the
reason why he declined coming at that time any farther with me toward
London than Dunstable, and why, when we parted there, he told me it was
not convenient for him to come part of the way to London to bring me
going, as he would otherwise have done.  I have observed that the
account of his life would have made a much more pleasing history than
this of mine; and, indeed, nothing in it was more strange than this
part, viz. that he carried on that desperate trade full five-and-twenty
years and had never been taken, the success he had met with had been so
very uncommon, and such that sometimes he had lived handsomely, and
retired in place for a year or two at a time, keeping himself and a
man-servant to wait on him, and had often sat in the coffee-houses and
heard the very people whom he had robbed give accounts of their being
robbed, and of the place and circumstances, so that he could easily
remember that it was the same.

In this manner, it seems, he lived near Liverpool at the time he
unluckily married me for a fortune.  Had I been the fortune he
expected, I verily believe, as he said, that he would have taken up and
lived honestly all his days.

He had with the rest of his misfortunes the good luck not to be
actually upon the spot when the robbery was done which he was committed
for, and so none of the persons robbed could swear to him, or had
anything to charge upon him.  But it seems as he was taken with the
gang, one hard-mouthed countryman swore home to him, and they were like
to have others come in according to the publication they had made; so
that they expected more evidence against him, and for that reason he
was kept in hold.

However, the offer which was made to him of admitting him to
transportation was made, as I understood, upon the intercession of some
great person who pressed him hard to accept of it before a trial; and
indeed, as he knew there were several that might come in against him, I
thought his friend was in the right, and I lay at him night and day to
delay it no longer.

At last, with much difficulty, he gave his consent; and as he was not
therefore admitted to transportation in court, and on his petition, as
I was, so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking
himself as I had said he might have done; his great friend, who was his
intercessor for the favour of that grant, having given security for him
that he should transport himself, and not return within the term.

This hardship broke all my measures, for the steps I took afterwards
for my own deliverance were hereby rendered wholly ineffectual, unless
I would abandon him, and leave him to go to America by himself; than
which he protested he would much rather venture, although he were
certain to go directly to the gallows.

I must now return to my case.  The time of my being transported
according to my sentence was near at hand; my governess, who continued
my fast friend, had tried to obtain a pardon, but it could not be done
unless with an expense too heavy for my purse, considering that to be
left naked and empty, unless I had resolved to return to my old trade
again, had been worse than my transportation, because there I knew I
could live, here I could not.  The good minister stood very hard on
another account to prevent my being transported also; but he was
answered, that indeed my life had been given me at his first
solicitations, and therefore he ought to ask no more. He was sensibly
grieved at my going, because, as he said, he feared I should lose the
good impressions which a prospect of death had at first made on me, and
which were since increased by his instructions; and the pious gentleman
was exceedingly concerned about me on that account.

On the other hand, I really was not so solicitous about it as I was
before, but I industriously concealed my reasons for it from the
minister, and to the last he did not know but that I went with the
utmost reluctance and affliction.

It was in the month of February that I was, with seven other convicts,
as they called us, delivered to a merchant that traded to Virginia, on
board a ship, riding, as they called it, in Deptford Reach.  The
officer of the prison delivered us on board, and the master of the
vessel gave a discharge for us.

We were for that night clapped under hatches, and kept so close that I
thought I should have been suffocated for want of air; and the next
morning the ship weighed, and fell down the river to a place they call
Bugby's Hole, which was done, as they told us, by the agreement of the
merchant, that all opportunity of escape should be taken from us.
However, when the ship came thither and cast anchor, we were allowed
more liberty, and particularly were permitted to come up on the deck,
but not up on the quarter-deck, that being kept particularly for the
captain and for passengers.

When by the noise of the men over my head, and the motion of the ship,
I perceived that they were under sail, I was at first greatly
surprised, fearing we should go away directly, and that our friends
would not be admitted to see us any more; but I was easy soon after,
when I found they had come to an anchor again, and soon after that we
had notice given by some of the men where we were, that the next
morning we should have the liberty to come up on deck, and to have our
friends come and see us if we had any.

All that night I lay upon the hard boards of the deck, as the
passengers did, but we had afterwards the liberty of little cabins for
such of us as had any bedding to lay in them, and room to stow any box
or trunk for clothes and linen, if we had it (which might well be put
in), for some of them had neither shirt nor shift or a rag of linen or
woollen, but what was on their backs, or a farthing of money to help
themselves; and yet I did not find but they fared well enough in the
ship, especially the women, who got money from the seamen for washing
their clothes, sufficient to  purchase any common things that they
wanted.

When the next morning we had the liberty to come up on the deck, I
asked one of the officers of the ship, whether I might not have the
liberty to send a letter on shore, to let my friends know where the
ship lay, and to get some necessary things sent to me.  This was, it
seems, the boatswain, a very civil, courteous sort of man, who told me
I should have that, or any other liberty that I desired, that he could
allow me with safety.  I told him I desired no other; and he answered
that the ship's boat would go up to London the next tide, and he would
order my letter to be carried.

Accordingly, when the boat went off, the boatswain came to me and told
me the boat was going off, and that he went in it himself, and asked me
if my letter was ready he would take care of it.  I had prepared
myself, you may be sure, pen, ink, and paper beforehand, and I had
gotten a letter ready directed to my governess, and enclosed another
for my fellow-prisoner, which, however, I did not let her know was my
husband, not to the last.  In that to my governess, I let her know
where the ship lay, and pressed her earnestly to send me what things I
knew she had got ready for me for my voyage.

When I gave the boatswain the letter, I gave him a shilling with it,
which I told him was for the charge of a messenger or porter, which I
entreated him to send with the letter as soon as he came on shore, that
if possible I might have an answer brought back by the same hand, that
I might know what was become of my things; 'for sir,' says I, 'if the
ship should go away before I have them on board, I am undone.'

I took care, when I gave him the shilling, to let him see that I had a
little better furniture about me than the ordinary prisoners, for he
saw that I had a purse, and in it a pretty deal of money; and I found
that the very sight of it immediately furnished me with very different
treatment from what I should otherwise have met with in the ship; for
though he was very courteous indeed before, in a kind of natural
compassion to me, as a woman in distress, yet he was more than
ordinarily so afterwards, and procured me to be better treated in the
ship than, I say, I might otherwise have been; as shall appear in its
place.

He very honestly had my letter delivered to my governess's own hands,
and brought me back an answer from her in writing; and when he gave me
the answer, gave me the shilling again.  'There,' says he, 'there's
your shilling again too, for I delivered the letter myself.'  I could
not tell what to say, I was so surprised at the thing; but after some
pause, I said, 'Sir, you are too kind; it had been but reasonable that
you had paid yourself coach-hire, then.'

'No, no,' says he, 'I am overpaid.  What is the gentlewoman?  Your
sister.'

'No, sir,' says I, 'she is no relation to me, but she is a dear friend,
and all the friends I have in the world.'  'Well,' says he, 'there are
few such friends in the world.  Why, she cried after you like a child,'
'Ay,' says I again, 'she would give a hundred pounds, I believe, to
deliver me from this dreadful condition I am in.'

'Would she so?' says he.  'For half the money I believe I could put you
in a way how to deliver yourself.'  But this he spoke softly, that
nobody could hear.

'Alas! sir,' said I, 'but then that must be such a deliverance as, if I
should be taken again, would cost me my life.'  'Nay,' said he, 'if you
were once out of the ship, you must look to yourself afterwards; that I
can say nothing to.'  So we dropped the discourse for that time.

In the meantime, my governess, faithful to the last moment, conveyed my
letter to the prison to my husband, and got an answer to it, and the
next day came down herself to the ship, bringing me, in the first
place, a sea-bed as they call it, and all its furniture, such as was
convenient, but not to let the people think it was extraordinary.  She
brought with her a sea-chest--that is, a chest, such as are made for
seamen, with all the conveniences in it, and filled with everything
almost that I could want; and in one of the corners of the chest, where
there was a private drawer, was my bank of money--this is to say, so
much of it as I had resolved to carry with me; for I ordered a part of
my stock to be left behind me, to be sent afterwards in such goods as I
should want when I came to settle; for money in that country is not of
much use where all things are brought for tobacco, much more is it a
great loss to carry it from hence.

But my case was particular; it was by no means proper to me to go
thither without money or goods, and for a poor convict, that was to be
sold as soon as I came on shore, to carry with me a cargo of goods
would be to have notice taken of it, and perhaps to have them seized by
the public; so I took part of my stock with me thus, and left the other
part with my governess.

My governess brought me a great many other things, but it was not
proper for me to look too well provided in the ship, at least till I
knew what kind of a captain we should have.  When she came into the
ship, I thought she would have died indeed; her heart sank at the sight
of me, and at the thoughts of parting with me in that condition, and
she cried so intolerably, I could not for a long time have any talk
with her.

I took that time to read my fellow-prisoner's letter, which, however,
greatly perplexed me.  He told me he was determined to go, but found it
would be impossible for him to be discharged time enough for going in
the same ship, and which was more than all, he began to question
whether they would give him leave to go in what ship he pleased, though
he did voluntarily transport himself; but that they would see him put
on board such a ship as they should direct, and that he would be
charged upon the captain as other convict prisoners were; so that he
began to be in despair of seeing me till he came to Virginia, which
made him almost desperate; seeing that, on the other hand, if I should
not be there, if any accident of the sea or of mortality should take me
away, he should be the most undone creature there in the world.

This was very perplexing, and I knew not what course to take.  I told
my governess the story of the boatswain, and she was mighty eager with
me treat with him; but I had no mind to it, till I heard whether my
husband, or fellow-prisoner, so she called him, could be at liberty to
go with me or no.  At last I was forced to let her into the whole
matter, except only that of his being my husband.  I told her I had
made a positive bargain or agreement with him to go, if he could get
the liberty of going in the same ship, and that I found he had money.

Then I read a long lecture to her of what I proposed to do when we came
there, how we could plant, settle, and, in short, grow rich without any
more adventures; and, as a great secret, I told her that we were to
marry as soon as he came on board.

She soon agreed cheerfully to my going when she heard this, and she
made it her business from that time to get him out of the prison in
time, so that he might go in the same ship with me, which at last was
brought to pass, though with great difficulty, and not without all the
forms of a transported prisoner-convict, which he really was not yet,
for he had not been tried, and which was a great mortification to him.
As our fate was now determined, and we were both on board, actually
bound to Virginia, in the despicable quality of transported convicts
destined to be sold for slaves, I for five years, and he under bonds
and security not to return to England any more, as long as he lived, he
was very much dejected and cast down; the mortification of being
brought on board, as he was, like a prisoner, piqued him very much,
since it was first told him he should transport himself, and so that he
might go as a gentleman at liberty.  It is true he was not ordered to
be sold when he came there, as we were, and for that reason he was
obliged to pay for his passage to the captain, which we were not; as to
the rest, he was as much at a loss as a child what to do with himself,
or with what he had, but by directions.

Our first business was to compare our stock.  He was very honest to me,
and told me his stock was pretty good when he came into the prison, but
the living there as he did in a figure like a gentleman, and, which was
ten times as much, the making of friends, and soliciting his case, had
been very expensive; and, in a word, all his stock that he had left was
#108, which he had about him all in gold.

I gave him an account of my stock as faithfully, that is to say, of
what I had taken to carry with me, for I was resolved, whatever should
happen, to keep what I had left with my governess in reserve; that in
case I should die, what I had with me was enough to give him, and that
which was left in my governess's hands would be her own, which she had
well deserved of me indeed.

My stock which I had with me was #246 some odd shillings; so that we
had #354 between us, but a worse gotten estate was scarce ever put
together to being the world with.

Our greatest misfortune as to our stock was that it was all in money,
which every one knows is an unprofitable cargo to be carried to the
plantations.  I believe his was really all he had left in the world, as
he told me it was; but I, who had between #700 and #800 in bank when
this disaster befell me, and who had one of the faithfullest friends in
the world to manage it for me, considering she was a woman of manner of
religious principles, had still #300 left in her hand, which I reserved
as above; besides, some very valuable things, as particularly two gold
watches, some small pieces of plate, and some rings--all stolen goods.
The plate, rings, and watches were put in my chest with the money, and
with this fortune, and in the sixty-first year of my age, I launched
out into a new world, as I may call it, in the condition (as to what
appeared) only of a poor, naked convict, ordered to be transported in
respite from the gallows.  My clothes were poor and mean, but not
ragged or dirty, and none knew in the whole ship that I had anything of
value about me.

However, as I had a great many very good clothes and linen in
abundance, which I had ordered to be packed up in two great boxes, I
had them shipped on board, not as my goods, but as consigned to my real
name in Virginia; and had the bills of loading signed by a captain in
my pocket; and in these boxes was my plate and watches, and everything
of value except my money, which I kept by itself in a private drawer in
my chest, which could not be found, or opened, if found, without splitting
the chest to pieces.

In this condition I lay for three weeks in the ship, not knowing
whether I should have my husband with me or no, and therefore not
resolving how or in what manner to receive the honest boatswain's
proposal, which indeed he thought a little strange at first.

At the end of this time, behold my husband came on board.  He looked
with a dejected, angry countenance, his great heart was swelled with
rage and disdain; to be dragged along with three keepers of Newgate,
and put on board like a convict, when he had not so much as been
brought to a trial.  He made loud complaints of it by his friends, for
it seems he had some interest; but his friends got some check in their
application, and were told he had had favour enough, and that they had
received such an account of him, since the last grant of his
transportation, that he ought to think himself very well treated that
he was not prosecuted anew.  This answer quieted him at once, for he
knew too much what might have happened, and what he had room to expect;
and now he saw the goodness of the advice to him, which prevailed with
him to accept of the offer of a voluntary transportation.  And after
this his chagrin at these hell-hounds, as he called them, was a little
over, he looked a little composed, began to be cheerful, and as I was
telling him how glad I was to have him once more out of their hands, he
took me in his arms, and acknowledged with great tenderness that I had
given him the best advice possible.  'My dear,' says he, 'thou has
twice saved my life; from henceforward it shall be all employed for
you, and I'll always take your advice.'

The ship began now to fill; several passengers came on board, who were
embarked on no criminal account, and these had accommodations assigned
them in the great cabin, and other parts of the ship, whereas we, as
convicts, were thrust down below, I know not where.  But when my
husband came on board, I spoke to the boatswain, who had so early given
me hints of his friendship in carrying my letter.  I told him he had
befriended me in many things, and I had not made any suitable return to
him, and with that I put a guinea into his hand.  I told him that my
husband was now come on board; that though we were both under the
present misfortune, yet we had been persons of a different character
from the wretched crew that we came with, and desired to know of him,
whether the captain might not be moved to admit us to some conveniences
in the ship, for which we would make him what satisfaction he pleased,
and that we would gratify him for his pains in procuring this for us.
He took the guinea, as I could see, with great satisfaction, and
assured me of his assistance.

Then he told us he did not doubt but that the captain, who was one of
the best-humoured gentlemen in the world, would be easily brought to
accommodate us as well as we could desire, and, to make me easy, told
me he would go up the next tide on purpose to speak to the captain
about it.  The next morning, happening to sleep a little longer than
ordinary, when I got up, and began to look abroad, I saw the boatswain
among the men in his ordinary business.  I was a little melancholy at
seeing him there, and going forward to speak to him, he saw me, and
came towards me, but not giving him time to speak first, I said,
smiling, 'I doubt, sir, you have forgot us, for I see you are very
busy.'  He returned presently, 'Come along with me, and you shall see.'
So he took me into the great cabin, and there sat a good sort of a
gentlemanly man for a seaman, writing, and with a great many papers
before him.

'Here,' says the boatswain to him that was a-writing, 'is the
gentlewoman that the captain spoke to you of'; and turning to me, he
said, 'I have been so far from forgetting your business, that I have
been up at the captain's house, and have represented faithfully to the
captain what you said, relating to you being furnished with better
conveniences for yourself and your husband; and the captain has sent
this gentleman, who is mate of the ship, down with me, on purpose to
show you everything, and to accommodate you fully to your content, and
bid me assure you that you shall not be treated like what you were at
first expected to be, but with the same respect as other passengers are
treated.'

The mate then spoke to me, and, not giving me time to thank the
boatswain for his kindness, confirmed what the boatswain had said, and
added that it was the captain's delight to show himself kind and
charitable, especially to those that were under any misfortunes, and
with that he showed me several cabins built up, some in the great
cabin, and some partitioned off, out of the steerage, but opening into
the great cabin on purpose for the accommodation of passengers, and
gave me leave to choose where I would.  However, I chose a cabin which
opened into the steerage, in which was very good conveniences to set
our chest and boxes, and a table to eat on.

The mate then told me that the boatswain had given so good a character
of me and my husband, as to our civil behaviour, that he had orders to
tell me we should eat with him, if we thought fit, during the whole
voyage, on the common terms of passengers; that we might lay in some
fresh provisions, if we pleased; or if not, he should lay in his usual
store, and we should have share with him.  This was very reviving news
to me, after so many hardships and afflictions as I had gone through of
late.  I thanked him, and told him the captain should make his own
terms with us, and asked him leave to go and tell my husband of it, who
was not very well, and was not yet out of his cabin.  Accordingly I
went, and my husband, whose spirits were still so much sunk with the
indignity (as he understood it) offered him, that he was scared yet
himself, was so revived with the account that I gave him of the
reception we were like to have in the ship, that he was quite another
man, and new vigour and courage appeared in his very countenance.  So
true is it, that the greatest of spirits, when overwhelmed by their
afflictions, are subject to the greatest dejections, and are tth thankfulness; and from this time forward I believe he
was as sincere a penitent, and as thoroughly a reformed man, as ever
God's goodness brought back from a profligate, a highwayman, and a
robber.  I could fill a larger history than this with the evidence of
this truth, and but that I doubt that part of the story will not be
equally diverting as the wicked part, I have had thoughts of making a
volume of it by itself.

As for myself, as this is to be my own story, not my husband's, I
return to that part which related to myself.  We went on with our
plantation, and managed it with the help and diversion of such friends
as we got there by our obliging behaviour, and especially the honest
Quaker, who proved a faithful, generous, and steady friend to us; and
we had very good success, for having a flourishing stock to begin with,
as I have said, and this being now increased by the addition of #150
sterling in money, we enlarged our number of servants, built us a very
good house, and cured every year a great deal of land.  The second year
I wrote to my old governess, giving her part with us of the joy of our
success, and order her how to lay out the money I had left with her,
which was #250 as above, and to send it to us in goods, which she
performed with her usual kindness and fidelity, and this arrived safe
to us.

Here we had a supply of all sorts of clothes, as well for my husband as
for myself; and I took especial care to buy for him all those things
that I knew he delighted to have; as two good long wigs, two
silver-hilted swords, three or four fine fowling-pieces, a fine saddle
with holsters and pistols very handsome, with a scarlet cloak; and, in
a word, everything I could think of to oblige him, and to make him
appear, as he really was, a very fine gentleman.  I ordered a good
quantity of such household stuff as we yet wanted, with linen of all
sorts for us both.  As for myself, I wanted very little of clothes or
linen, being very well furnished before.  The rest of my cargo
consisted in iron-work of all sorts, harness for horses, tools, clothes
for servants, and woollen cloth, stuffs, serges, stockings, shoes,
hats, and the like, such as servants wear; and whole pieces also to
make up for servants, all by direction of the Quaker; and all this
cargo arrived safe, and in good condition, with three woman-servants,
lusty wenches, which my old governess had picked for me, suitable
enough to the place, and to the work we had for them to do; one of
which happened to come double, having been got with child by one of the
seamen in the ship, as she owned afterwards, before the ship got so far
as Gravesend; so she brought us a stout boy, about seven months after
her landing.

My husband, you may suppose, was a little surprised at the arriving of
all this cargo from England; and talking with me after he saw the
account of this particular, 'My dear,' says he, 'what is the meaning of
all this?  I fear you will run us too deep in debt:  when shall we be
able to make return for it all?' I smiled, and told him that is was all
paid for; and then I told him, that what our circumstances might expose
us to, I had not taken my whole stock with me, that I had reserved so
much in my friend's hands, which now we were come over safe, and was
settled in a way to live, I had sent for, as he might see.

He was amazed, and stood a while telling upon his fingers, but said
nothing.  At last he began thus:  'Hold, let's see,' says he, telling
upon his fingers still, and first on his thumb; 'there's #246 in money
at first, then two gold watches, diamond rings, and plate,' says he,
upon the forefinger.  Then upon the next finger, 'Here's a plantation
on York River, #100 a year, then #150 in money, then a sloop load of
horses, cows, hogs, and stores'; and so on to the thumb again.  'And
now,' says he, 'a cargo cost #250 in England, and worth here twice the
money.' 'Well,' says I, 'what do you make of all that?'  'Make of it?'
says he; 'why, who says I was deceived when I married a wife in
Lancashire?  I think I have married a fortune, and a very good fortune
too,' says he.

In a word, we were now in very considerable circumstances, and every
year increasing; for our new plantation grew upon our hands insensibly,
and in eight years which we lived upon it, we brought it to such pitch,
that the produce was at least #300 sterling a year; I mean, worth so
much in England.

After I had been a year at home again, I went over the bay to see my
son, and to receive another year's income of my plantation; and I was
surprised to hear, just at my landing there, that my old husband was
dead, and had not been buried above a fortnight.  This, I confess, was
not disagreeable news, because now I could appear as I was, in a
married condition; so I told my son before I came from him, that I
believed I should marry a gentleman who had a plantation near mine; and
though I was legally free to marry, as to any obligation that was on me
before, yet that I was shy of it, lest the blot should some time or
other be revived, and it might make a husband uneasy.  My son, the same
kind, dutiful, and obliging creature as ever, treated me now at his own
house, paid me my hundred pounds, and sent me home again loaded with
presents.

Some time after this, I let my son know I was married, and invited him
over to see us, and my husband wrote a very obliging letter to him
also, inviting him to come and see him; and he came accordingly some
months after, and happened to be there just when my cargo from England
came in, which I let him believe belonged all to my husband's estate,
not to me.

It must be observed that when the old wretch my brother (husband) was
dead, I then freely gave my husband an account of all that affair, and
of this cousin, as I had called him before, being my own son by that
mistaken unhappy match.  He was perfectly easy in the account, and told
me he should have been as easy if the old man, as we called him, had
been alive.  'For,' said he, 'it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it
was a mistake impossible to be prevented.'  He only reproached him with
desiring me to conceal it, and to live with him as a wife, after I knew
that he was my brother; that, he said, was a vile part.  Thus all these
difficulties were made easy, and we lived together with the greatest
kindness and comfort imaginable.

We are grown old; I am come back to England, being almost seventy years
of age, husband sixty-eight, having performed much more than the
limited terms of my transportation; and now, notwithstanding all the
fatigues and all the miseries we have both gone through, we are both of
us in good heart and health.  My husband remained there some time after
me to settle our affairs, and at first I had intended to go back to
him, but at his desire I altered that resolution, and he is come over
to England also, where we resolve to spend the remainder of our years
in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived.

WRITTEN IN THE YEAR 1683
CHAPTER I
DESCRIPTION OF A PALACE IN A VALLEY.


YE who listen with credulity to the whispers of fancy, and pursue with
eagerness the phantoms of hope; who expect that age will perform the
promises of youth, and that the deficiencies of the present day will be
supplied by the morrow, attend to the history of Rasselas, Prince of
Abyssinia.

Rasselas was the fourth son of the mighty Emperor in whose dominions the
father of waters begins his course—whose bounty pours down the streams of
plenty, and scatters over the world the harvests of Egypt.

According to the custom which has descended from age to age among the
monarchs of the torrid zone, Rasselas was confined in a private palace,
with the other sons and daughters of Abyssinian royalty, till the order
of succession should call him to the throne.

The place which the wisdom or policy of antiquity had destined for the
residence of the Abyssinian princes was a spacious valley in the kingdom
of Amhara, surrounded on every side by mountains, of which the summits
overhang the middle part.  The only passage by which it could be entered
was a cavern that passed under a rock, of which it had long been disputed
whether it was the work of nature or of human industry.  The outlet of
the cavern was concealed by a thick wood, and the mouth which opened into
the valley was closed with gates of iron, forged by the artificers of
ancient days, so massive that no man, without the help of engines, could
open or shut them.

From the mountains on every side rivulets descended that filled all the
valley with verdure and fertility, and formed a lake in the middle,
inhabited by fish of every species, and frequented by every fowl whom
nature has taught to dip the wing in water.  This lake discharged its
superfluities by a stream, which entered a dark cleft of the mountain on
the northern side, and fell with dreadful noise from precipice to
precipice till it was heard no more.

The sides of the mountains were covered with trees, the banks of the
brooks were diversified with flowers; every blast shook spices from the
rocks, and every month dropped fruits upon the ground.  All animals that
bite the grass or browse the shrubs, whether wild or tame, wandered in
this extensive circuit, secured from beasts of prey by the mountains
which confined them.  On one part were flocks and herds feeding in the
pastures, on another all the beasts of chase frisking in the lawns, the
sprightly kid was bounding on the rocks, the subtle monkey frolicking in
the trees, and the solemn elephant reposing in the shade.  All the
diversities of the world were brought together, the blessings of nature
were collected, and its evils extracted and excluded.

The valley, wide and fruitful, supplied its inhabitants with all the
necessaries of life, and all delights and superfluities were added at the
annual visit which the Emperor paid his children, when the iron gate was
opened to the sound of music, and during eight days every one that
resided in the valley was required to propose whatever might contribute
to make seclusion pleasant, to fill up the vacancies of attention, and
lessen the tediousness of time.  Every desire was immediately granted.
All the artificers of pleasure were called to gladden the festivity; the
musicians exerted the power of harmony, and the dancers showed their
activity before the princes, in hopes that they should pass their lives
in blissful captivity, to which those only were admitted whose
performance was thought able to add novelty to luxury.  Such was the
appearance of security and delight which this retirement afforded, that
they to whom it was new always desired that it might be perpetual; and as
those on whom the iron gate had once closed were never suffered to
return, the effect of longer experience could not be known.  Thus every
year produced new scenes of delight, and new competitors for
imprisonment.

The palace stood on an eminence, raised about thirty paces above the
surface of the lake.  It was divided into many squares or courts, built
with greater or less magnificence according to the rank of those for whom
they were designed.  The roofs were turned into arches of massive stone,
joined by a cement that grew harder by time, and the building stood from
century to century, deriding the solstitial rains and equinoctial
hurricanes, without need of reparation.

This house, which was so large as to be fully known to none but some
ancient officers, who successively inherited the secrets of the place,
was built as if Suspicion herself had dictated the plan.  To every room
there was an open and secret passage; every square had a communication
with the rest, either from the upper storeys by private galleries, or by
subterraneous passages from the lower apartments.  Many of the columns
had unsuspected cavities, in which a long race of monarchs had deposited
their treasures.  They then closed up the opening with marble, which was
never to be removed but in the utmost exigences of the kingdom, and
recorded their accumulations in a book, which was itself concealed in a
tower, not entered but by the Emperor, attended by the prince who stood
next in succession.




CHAPTER II
THE DISCONTENT OF RASSELAS IN THE HAPPY VALLEY.


HERE the sons and daughters of Abyssinia lived only to know the soft
vicissitudes of pleasure and repose, attended by all that were skilful to
delight, and gratified with whatever the senses can enjoy.  They wandered
in gardens of fragrance, and slept in the fortresses of security.  Every
art was practised to make them pleased with their own condition.  The
sages who instructed them told them of nothing but the miseries of public
life, and described all beyond the mountains as regions of calamity,
where discord was always racing, and where man preyed upon man.  To
heighten their opinion of their own felicity, they were daily entertained
with songs, the subject of which was the Happy Valley.  Their appetites
were excited by frequent enumerations of different enjoyments, and
revelry and merriment were the business of every hour, from the dawn of
morning to the close of the evening.

These methods were generally successful; few of the princes had ever
wished to enlarge their bounds, but passed their lives in full conviction
that they had all within their reach that art or nature could bestow, and
pitied those whom nature had excluded from this seat of tranquillity as
the sport of chance and the slaves of misery.

Thus they rose in the morning and lay down at night, pleased with each
other and with themselves, all but Rasselas, who, in the twenty-sixth
year of his age, began to withdraw himself from the pastimes and
assemblies, and to delight in solitary walks and silent meditation.  He
often sat before tables covered with luxury, and forgot to taste the
dainties that were placed before him; he rose abruptly in the midst of
the song, and hastily retired beyond the sound of music.  His attendants
observed the change, and endeavoured to renew his love of pleasure.  He
neglected their officiousness, repulsed their invitations, and spent day
after day on the banks of rivulets sheltered with trees, where he
sometimes listened to the birds in the branches, sometimes observed the
fish playing in the streams, and anon cast his eyes upon the pastures and
mountains filled with animals, of which some were biting the herbage, and
some sleeping among the bushes.  The singularity of his humour made him
much observed.  One of the sages, in whose conversation he had formerly
delighted, followed him secretly, in hope of discovering the cause of his
disquiet.  Rasselas, who knew not that any one was near him, having for
some time fixed his eyes upon the goats that were browsing among the
rocks, began to compare their condition with his own.

“What,” said he, “makes the difference between man and all the rest of
the animal creation?  Every beast that strays beside me has the same
corporal necessities with myself: he is hungry, and crops the grass; he
is thirsty, and drinks the stream; his thirst and hunger are appeased; he
is satisfied, and sleeps; he rises again, and is hungry; he is again fed,
and is at rest.  I am hungry and thirsty, like him, but when thirst and
hunger cease, I am not at rest.  I am, like him, pained with want, but am
not, like him, satisfied with fulness.  The intermediate hours are
tedious and gloomy; I long again to be hungry that I may again quicken
the attention.  The birds peck the berries or the corn, and fly away to
the groves, where they sit in seeming happiness on the branches, and
waste their lives in tuning one unvaried series of sounds.  I likewise
can call the lutist and the singer; but the sounds that pleased me
yesterday weary me to-day, and will grow yet more wearisome to-morrow.  I
can discover in me no power of perception which is not glutted with its
proper pleasure, yet I do not feel myself delighted.  Man surely has some
latent sense for which this place affords no gratification; or he has
some desire distinct from sense, which must be satisfied before he can be
happy.”

After this he lifted up his head, and seeing the moon rising, walked
towards the palace.  As he passed through the fields, and saw the animals
around him, “Ye,” said he, “are happy, and need not envy me that walk
thus among you, burdened with myself; nor do I, ye gentle beings, envy
your felicity; for it is not the felicity of man.  I have many distresses
from which you are free; I fear pain when I do not feel it; I sometimes
shrink at evils recollected, and sometimes start at evils anticipated:
surely the equity of Providence has balanced peculiar sufferings with
peculiar enjoyments.”

With observations like these the Prince amused himself as he returned,
uttering them with a plaintive voice, yet with a look that discovered him
to feel some complacence in his own perspicacity, and to receive some
solace of the miseries of life from consciousness of the delicacy with
which he felt and the eloquence with which he bewailed them.  He mingled
cheerfully in the diversions of the evening, and all rejoiced to find
that his heart was lightened.




CHAPTER III
THE WANTS OF HIM THAT WANTS NOTHING.


ON the next day, his old instructor, imagining that he had now made
himself acquainted with his disease of mind, was in hope of curing it by
counsel, and officiously sought an opportunity of conference, which the
Prince, having long considered him as one whose intellects were
exhausted, was not very willing to afford.  “Why,” said he, “does this
man thus intrude upon me?  Shall I never be suffered to forget these
lectures, which pleased only while they were new, and to become new again
must be forgotten?”  He then walked into the wood, and composed himself
to his usual meditations; when, before his thoughts had taken any settled
form, he perceived his pursuer at his side, and was at first prompted by
his impatience to go hastily away; but being unwilling to offend a man
whom he had once reverenced and still loved, he invited him to sit down
with him on the bank.

The old man, thus encouraged, began to lament the change which had been
lately observed in the Prince, and to inquire why he so often retired
from the pleasures of the palace to loneliness and silence.  “I fly from
pleasure,” said the Prince, “because pleasure has ceased to please: I am
lonely because I am miserable, and am unwilling to cloud with my presence
the happiness of others.”  “You, sir,” said the sage, “are the first who
has complained of misery in the Happy Valley.  I hope to convince you
that your complaints have no real cause.  You are here in full possession
of all the Emperor of Abyssinia can bestow; here is neither labour to be
endured nor danger to be dreaded, yet here is all that labour or danger
can procure or purchase.  Look round and tell me which of your wants is
without supply: if you want nothing, how are you unhappy?”

“That I want nothing,” said the Prince, “or that I know not what I want,
is the cause of my complaint: if I had any known want, I should have a
certain wish; that wish would excite endeavour, and I should not then
repine to see the sun move so slowly towards the western mountains, or to
lament when the day breaks, and sleep will no longer hide me from myself.
When I see the kids and the lambs chasing one another, I fancy that I
should be happy if I had something to pursue.  But, possessing all that I
can want, I find one day and one hour exactly like another, except that
the latter is still more tedious than the former.  Let your experience
inform me how the day may now seem as short as in my childhood, while
nature was yet fresh, and every moment showed me what I never had
observed before.  I have already enjoyed too much: give me something to
desire.”  The old man was surprised at this new species of affliction,
and knew not what to reply, yet was unwilling to be silent.  “Sir,” said
he, “if you had seen the miseries of the world, you would know how to
value your present state.”  “Now,” said the Prince, “you have given me
something to desire.  I shall long to see the miseries of the world,
since the sight of them is necessary to happiness.”




CHAPTER IV
THE PRINCE CONTINUES TO GRIEVE AND MUSE.


AT this time the sound of music proclaimed the hour of repast, and the
conversation was concluded.  The old man went away sufficiently
discontented to find that his reasonings had produced the only conclusion
which they were intended to prevent.  But in the decline of life, shame
and grief are of short duration: whether it be that we bear easily what
we have borne long; or that, finding ourselves in age less regarded, we
less regard others; or that we look with slight regard upon afflictions
to which we know that the hand of death is about to put an end.

The Prince, whose views were extended to a wider space, could not
speedily quiet his emotions.  He had been before terrified at the length
of life which nature promised him, because he considered that in a long
time much must be endured: he now rejoiced in his youth, because in many
years much might be done.  The first beam of hope that had been ever
darted into his mind rekindled youth in his cheeks, and doubled the
lustre of his eyes.  He was fired with the desire of doing something,
though he knew not yet, with distinctness, either end or means.  He was
now no longer gloomy and unsocial; but considering himself as master of a
secret stock of happiness, which he could only enjoy by concealing it, he
affected to be busy in all the schemes of diversion, and endeavoured to
make others pleased with the state of which he himself was weary.  But
pleasures can never be so multiplied or continued as not to leave much of
life unemployed; there were many hours, both of the night and day, which
he could spend without suspicion in solitary thought.  The load of life
was much lightened; he went eagerly into the assemblies, because he
supposed the frequency of his presence necessary to the success of his
purposes; he retired gladly to privacy, because he had now a subject of
thought.  His chief amusement was to picture to himself that world which
he had never seen, to place himself in various conditions, to be
entangled in imaginary difficulties, and to be engaged in wild
adventures; but, his benevolence always terminated his projects in the
relief of distress, the detection of fraud, the defeat of oppression, and
the diffusion of happiness.

Thus passed twenty months of the life of Rasselas.  He busied himself so
intensely in visionary bustle that he forgot his real solitude; and
amidst hourly preparations for the various incidents of human affairs,
neglected to consider by what means he should mingle with mankind.

One day, as he was sitting on a bank, he feigned to himself an orphan
virgin robbed of her little portion by a treacherous lover, and crying
after him for restitution.  So strongly was the image impressed upon his
mind that he started up in the maid’s defence, and ran forward to seize
the plunderer with all the eagerness of real pursuit.  Fear naturally
quickens the flight of guilt.  Rasselas could not catch the fugitive with
his utmost efforts; but, resolving to weary by perseverance him whom he
could not surpass in speed, he pressed on till the foot of the mountain
stopped his course.

Here he recollected himself, and smiled at his own useless impetuosity.
Then raising his eyes to the mountain, “This,” said he, “is the fatal
obstacle that hinders at once the enjoyment of pleasure and the exercise
of virtue.  How long is it that my hopes and wishes have flown beyond
this boundary of my life, which yet I never have attempted to surmount?”

Struck with this reflection, he sat down to muse, and remembered that
since he first resolved to escape from his confinement, the sun had
passed twice over him in his annual course.  He now felt a degree of
regret with which he had never been before acquainted.  He considered how
much might have been done in the time which had passed, and left nothing
real behind it.  He compared twenty months with the life of man.  “In
life,” said he, “is not to be counted the ignorance of infancy or
imbecility of age.  We are long before we are able to think, and we soon
cease from the power of acting.  The true period of human existence may
be reasonably estimated at forty years, of which I have mused away the
four-and-twentieth part.  What I have lost was certain, for I have
certainly possessed it; but of twenty months to come, who can assure me?”

The consciousness of his own folly pierced him deeply, and he was long
before he could be reconciled to himself.  “The rest of my time,” said
he, “has been lost by the crime or folly of my ancestors, and the absurd
institutions of my country; I remember it with disgust, yet without
remorse: but the months that have passed since new light darted into my
soul, since I formed a scheme of reasonable felicity, have been
squandered by my own fault.  I have lost that which can never be
restored; I have seen the sun rise and set for twenty months, an idle
gazer on the light of heaven; in this time the birds have left the nest
of their mother, and committed themselves to the woods and to the skies;
the kid has forsaken the teat, and learned by degrees to climb the rocks
in quest of independent sustenance.  I only have made no advances, but am
still helpless and ignorant.  The moon, by more than twenty changes,
admonished me of the flux of life; the stream that rolled before my feet
upbraided my inactivity.  I sat feasting on intellectual luxury,
regardless alike of the examples of the earth and the instructions of the
planets.  Twenty months are passed: who shall restore them?”

These sorrowful meditations fastened upon his mind; he passed four months
in resolving to lose no more time in idle resolves, and was awakened to
more vigorous exertion by hearing a maid, who had broken a porcelain cup,
remark that what cannot be repaired is not to be regretted.

This was obvious; and Rasselas reproached himself that he had not
discovered it—having not known, or not considered, how many useful hints
are obtained by chance, and how often the mind, hurried by her own ardour
to distant views, neglects the truths that lie open before her.  He for a
few hours regretted his regret, and from that time bent his whole mind
upon the means of escaping from the Valley of Happiness.




CHAPTER V
THE PRINCE MEDITATES HIS ESCAPE.


HE now found that it would be very difficult to effect that which it was
very easy to suppose effected.  When he looked round about him, he saw
himself confined by the bars of nature, which had never yet been broken,
and by the gate through which none that had once passed it were ever able
to return.  He was now impatient as an eagle in a grate.  He passed week
after week in clambering the mountains to see if there was any aperture
which the bushes might conceal, but found all the summits inaccessible by
their prominence.  The iron gate he despaired to open for it was not only
secured with all the power of art, but was always watched by successive
sentinels, and was, by its position, exposed to the perpetual observation
of all the inhabitants.

He then examined the cavern through which the waters of the lake were
discharged; and, looking down at a time when the sun shone strongly upon
its mouth, he discovered it to be full of broken rocks, which, though
they permitted the stream to flow through many narrow passages, would
stop any body of solid bulk.  He returned discouraged and dejected; but
having now known the blessing of hope, resolved never to despair.

In these fruitless researches he spent ten months.  The time, however,
passed cheerfully away—in the morning he rose with new hope; in the
evening applauded his own diligence; and in the night slept soundly after
his fatigue.  He met a thousand amusements, which beguiled his labour and
diversified his thoughts.  He discerned the various instincts of animals
and properties of plants, and found the place replete with wonders, of
which he proposed to solace himself with the contemplation if he should
never be able to accomplish his flight—rejoicing that his endeavours,
though yet unsuccessful, had supplied him with a source of inexhaustible
inquiry.  But his original curiosity was not yet abated; he resolved to
obtain some knowledge of the ways of men.  His wish still continued, but
his hope grew less.  He ceased to survey any longer the walls of his
prison, and spared to search by new toils for interstices which he knew
could not be found, yet determined to keep his design always in view, and
lay hold on any expedient that time should offer.




CHAPTER VI
A DISSERTATION ON THE ART OF FLYING.


AMONG the artists that had been allured into the Happy Valley, to labour
for the accommodation and pleasure of its inhabitants, was a man eminent
for his knowledge of the mechanic powers, who had contrived many engines
both of use and recreation.  By a wheel which the stream turned he forced
the water into a tower, whence it was distributed to all the apartments
of the palace.  He erected a pavilion in the garden, around which he kept
the air always cool by artificial showers.  One of the groves,
appropriated to the ladies, was ventilated by fans, to which the rivulets
that ran through it gave a constant motion; and instruments of soft music
were played at proper distances, of which some played by the impulse of
the wind, and some by the power of the stream.

This artist was sometimes visited by Rasselas who was pleased with every
kind of knowledge, imagining that the time would come when all his
acquisitions should be of use to him in the open world.  He came one day
to amuse himself in his usual manner, and found the master busy in
building a sailing chariot.  He saw that the design was practicable upon
a level surface, and with expressions of great esteem solicited its
completion.  The workman was pleased to find himself so much regarded by
the Prince, and resolved to gain yet higher honours.  “Sir,” said he,
“you have seen but a small part of what the mechanic sciences can
perform.  I have been long of opinion that, instead of the tardy
conveyance of ships and chariots, man might use the swifter migration of
wings, that the fields of air are open to knowledge, and that only
ignorance and idleness need crawl upon the ground.”

This hint rekindled the Prince’s desire of passing the mountains.  Having
seen what the mechanist had already performed, he was willing to fancy
that he could do more, yet resolved to inquire further before he suffered
hope to afflict him by disappointment.  “I am afraid,” said he to the
artist, “that your imagination prevails over your skill, and that you now
tell me rather what you wish than what you know.  Every animal has his
element assigned him; the birds have the air, and man and beasts the
earth.”  “So,” replied the mechanist, “fishes have the water, in which
yet beasts can swim by nature and man by art.  He that can swim needs not
despair to fly; to swim is to fly in a grosser fluid, and to fly is to
swim in a subtler.  We are only to proportion our power of resistance to
the different density of matter through which we are to pass.  You will
be necessarily up-borne by the air if you can renew any impulse upon it
faster than the air can recede from the pressure.”

“But the exercise of swimming,” said the Prince, “is very laborious; the
strongest limbs are soon wearied.  I am afraid the act of flying will be
yet more violent; and wings will be of no great use unless we can fly
further than we can swim.”

“The labour of rising from the ground,” said the artist, “will be great,
as we see it in the heavier domestic fowls; but as we mount higher the
earth’s attraction and the body’s gravity will be gradually diminished,
till we shall arrive at a region where the man shall float in the air
without any tendency to fall; no care will then be necessary but to move
forward, which the gentlest impulse will effect.  You, sir, whose
curiosity is so extensive, will easily conceive with what pleasure a
philosopher, furnished with wings and hovering in the sky, would see the
earth and all its inhabitants rolling beneath him, and presenting to him
successively, by its diurnal motion, all the countries within the same
parallel.  How must it amuse the pendent spectator to see the moving
scene of land and ocean, cities and deserts; to survey with equal
security the marts of trade and the fields of battle; mountains infested
by barbarians, and fruitful regions gladdened by plenty and lulled by
peace.  How easily shall we then trace the Nile through all his passages,
pass over to distant regions, and examine the face of nature from one
extremity of the earth to the other.”

“All this,” said the Prince, “is much to be desired, but I am afraid that
no man will be able to breathe in these regions of speculation and
tranquillity.  I have been told that respiration is difficult upon lofty
mountains, yet from these precipices, though so high as to produce great
tenuity of air, it is very easy to fall; therefore I suspect that from
any height where life can be supported, there may be danger of too quick
descent.”

“Nothing,” replied the artist, “will ever be attempted if all possible
objections must be first overcome.  If you will favour my project, I will
try the first flight at my own hazard.  I have considered the structure
of all volant animals, and find the folding continuity of the bat’s wings
most easily accommodated to the human form.  Upon this model I shall
begin my task to-morrow, and in a year expect to tower into the air
beyond the malice and pursuit of man.  But I will work only on this
condition, that the art shall not be divulged, and that you shall not
require me to make wings for any but ourselves.”

“Why,” said Rasselas, “should you envy others so great an advantage?  All
skill ought to be exerted for universal good; every man has owed much to
others, and ought to repay the kindness that he has received.”

“If men were all virtuous,” returned the artist, “I should with great
alacrity teach them to fly.  But what would be the security of the good
if the bad could at pleasure invade them from the sky?  Against an army
sailing through the clouds neither walls, mountains, nor seas could
afford security.  A flight of northern savages might hover in the wind
and light with irresistible violence upon the capital of a fruitful
reason.  Even this valley, the retreat of princes, the abode of
happiness, might be violated by the sudden descent of some of the naked
nations that swarm on the coast of the southern sea!”

The Prince promised secrecy, and waited for the performance, not wholly
hopeless of success.  He visited the work from time to time, observed its
progress, and remarked many ingenious contrivances to facilitate motion
and unite levity with strength.  The artist was every day more certain
that he should leave vultures and eagles behind him, and the contagion of
his confidence seized upon the Prince.  In a year the wings were
finished; and on a morning appointed the maker appeared, furnished for
flight, on a little promontory; he waved his pinions awhile to gather
air, then leaped from his stand, and in an instant dropped into the lake.
His wings, which were of no use in the air, sustained him in the water;
and the Prince drew him to land half dead with terror and vexation.




CHAPTER VII
THE PRINCE FINDS A MAN OF LEARNING.


THE Prince was not much afflicted by this disaster, having suffered
himself to hope for a happier event only because he had no other means of
escape in view.  He still persisted in his design to leave the Happy
Valley by the first opportunity.

His imagination was now at a stand; he had no prospect of entering into
the world, and, notwithstanding all his endeavours to support himself,
discontent by degrees preyed upon him, and he began again to lose his
thoughts in sadness when the rainy season, which in these countries is
periodical, made it inconvenient to wander in the woods.

The rain continued longer and with more violence than had ever been
known; the clouds broke on the surrounding mountains, and the torrents
streamed into the plain on every side, till the cavern was too narrow to
discharge the water.  The lake overflowed its banks, and all the level of
the valley was covered with the inundation.  The eminence on which the
palace was built, and some other spots of rising ground, were all that
the eye could now discover.  The herds and flocks left the pasture, and
both the wild beasts and the tame retreated to the mountains.

This inundation confined all the princes to domestic amusements, and the
attention of Rasselas was particularly seized by a poem (which Imlac
rehearsed) upon the various conditions of humanity.  He commanded the
poet to attend him in his apartment, and recite his verses a second time;
then entering into familiar talk, he thought himself happy in having
found a man who knew the world so well, and could so skilfully paint the
scenes of life.  He asked a thousand questions about things to which,
though common to all other mortals, his confinement from childhood had
kept him a stranger.  The poet pitied his ignorance, and loved his
curiosity, and entertained him from day to day with novelty and
instruction so that the Prince regretted the necessity of sleep, and
longed till the morning should renew his pleasure.

As they were sitting together, the Prince commanded Imlac to relate his
history, and to tell by what accident he was forced, or by what motive
induced, to close his life in the Happy Valley.  As he was going to begin
his narrative, Rasselas was called to a concert, and obliged to restrain
his curiosity till the evening.




CHAPTER VIII
THE HISTORY OF IMLAC.


THE close of the day is, in the regions of the torrid zone, the only
season of diversion and entertainment, and it was therefore midnight
before the music ceased and the princesses retired.  Rasselas then called
for his companion, and required him to begin the story of his life.

“Sir,” said Imlac, “my history will not be long: the life that is devoted
to knowledge passes silently away, and is very little diversified by
events.  To talk in public, to think in solitude, to read and to hear, to
inquire and answer inquiries, is the business of a scholar.  He wanders
about the world without pomp or terror, and is neither known nor valued
but by men like himself.

“I was born in the kingdom of Goiama, at no great distance from the
fountain of the Nile.  My father was a wealthy merchant, who traded
between the inland countries of Africa and the ports of the Red Sea.  He
was honest, frugal, and diligent, but of mean sentiments and narrow
comprehension; he desired only to be rich, and to conceal his riches,
lest he should be spoiled by the governors of the province.”

“Surely,” said the Prince, “my father must be negligent of his charge if
any man in his dominions dares take that which belongs to another.  Does
he not know that kings are accountable for injustice permitted as well as
done?  If I were Emperor, not the meanest of my subjects should he
oppressed with impunity.  My blood boils when I am told that a merchant
durst not enjoy his honest gains for fear of losing them by the rapacity
of power.  Name the governor who robbed the people that I may declare his
crimes to the Emperor!”

“Sir,” said Imlac, “your ardour is the natural effect of virtue animated
by youth.  The time will come when you will acquit your father, and
perhaps hear with less impatience of the governor.  Oppression is, in the
Abyssinian dominions, neither frequent nor tolerated; but no form of
government has been yet discovered by which cruelty can be wholly
prevented.  Subordination supposes power on one part and subjection on
the other; and if power be in the hands of men it will sometimes be
abused.  The vigilance of the supreme magistrate may do much, but much
will still remain undone.  He can never know all the crimes that are
committed, and can seldom punish all that he knows.”

“This,” said the Prince, “I do not understand; but I had rather hear thee
than dispute.  Continue thy narration.”

“My father,” proceeded Imlac, “originally intended that I should have no
other education than such as might qualify me for commerce; and
discovering in me great strength of memory and quickness of apprehension,
often declared his hope that I should be some time the richest man in
Abyssinia.”

“Why,” said the Prince, “did thy father desire the increase of his wealth
when it was already greater than he durst discover or enjoy?  I am
unwilling to doubt thy veracity, yet inconsistencies cannot both be
true.”

“Inconsistencies,” answered Imlac, “cannot both be right; but, imputed to
man, they may both be true.  Yet diversity is not inconsistency.  My
father might expect a time of greater security.  However, some desire is
necessary to keep life in motion; and he whose real wants are supplied
must admit those of fancy.”

“This,” said the Prince, “I can in some measure conceive.  I repent that
I interrupted thee.”

“With this hope,” proceeded Imlac, “he sent me to school.  But when I had
once found the delight of knowledge, and felt the pleasure of
intelligence and the pride of invention, I began silently to despise
riches, and determined to disappoint the purposes of my father, whose
grossness of conception raised my pity.  I was twenty years old before
his tenderness would expose me to the fatigue of travel; in which time I
had been instructed, by successive masters, in all the literature of my
native country.  As every hour taught me something new, I lived in a
continual course of gratification; but as I advanced towards manhood, I
lost much of the reverence with which I had been used to look on my
instructors; because when the lessons were ended I did not find them
wiser or better than common men.

“At length my father resolved to initiate me in commerce; and, opening
one of his subterranean treasuries, counted out ten thousand pieces of
gold.  ‘This, young man,’ said he, ‘is the stock with which you must
negotiate.  I began with less than a fifth part, and you see how
diligence and parsimony have increased it.  This is your own, to waste or
improve.  If you squander it by negligence or caprice, you must wait for
my death before you will be rich; if in four years you double your stock,
we will thenceforward let subordination cease, and live together as
friends and partners, for he shall be always equal with me who is equally
skilled in the art of growing rich.’

“We laid out our money upon camels, concealed in bales of cheap goods,
and travelled to the shore of the Red Sea.  When I cast my eye on the
expanse of waters, my heart bounded like that of a prisoner escaped.  I
felt an inextinguishable curiosity kindle in my mind, and resolved to
snatch this opportunity of seeing the manners of other nations, and of
learning sciences unknown in Abyssinia.

“I remembered that my father had obliged me to the improvement of my
stock, not by a promise, which I ought not to violate, but by a penalty,
which I was at liberty to incur; and therefore determined to gratify my
predominant desire, and, by drinking at the fountain of knowledge, to
quench the thirst of curiosity.

“As I was supposed to trade without connection with my father, it was
easy for me to become acquainted with the master of a ship, and procure a
passage to some other country.  I had no motives of choice to regulate my
voyage.  It was sufficient for me that, wherever I wandered, I should see
a country which I had not seen before.  I therefore entered a ship bound
for Surat, having left a letter for my father declaring my intention.”




CHAPTER IX
THE HISTORY OF IMLAC (_continued_).


“WHEN I first entered upon the world of waters, and lost sight of land, I
looked round about me in pleasing terror, and thinking my soul enlarged
by the boundless prospect, imagined that I could gaze around me for ever
without satiety; but in a short time I grew weary of looking on barren
uniformity, where I could only see again what I had already seen.  I then
descended into the ship, and doubted for awhile whether all my future
pleasures would not end, like this, in disgust and disappointment.  ‘Yet
surely,’ said I, ‘the ocean and the land are very different.  The only
variety of water is rest and motion.  But the earth has mountains and
valleys, deserts and cities; it is inhabited by men of different customs
and contrary opinions; and I may hope to find variety in life, though I
should miss it in nature.’

“With this thought I quieted my mind, and amused myself during the
voyage, sometimes by learning from the sailors the art of navigation,
which I have never practised, and sometimes by forming schemes for my
conduct in different situations, in not one of which I have been ever
placed.

“I was almost weary of my naval amusements when we safely landed at
Surat.  I secured my money and, purchasing some commodities for show,
joined myself to a caravan that was passing into the inland country.  My
companions, for some reason or other, conjecturing that I was rich, and,
by my inquiries and admiration, finding that I was ignorant, considered
me as a novice whom they had a right to cheat, and who was to learn, at
the usual expense, the art of fraud.  They exposed me to the theft of
servants and the exaction of officers, and saw me plundered upon false
pretences, without any advantage to themselves but that of rejoicing in
the superiority of their own knowledge.”

“Stop a moment,” said the Prince; “is there such depravity in man as that
he should injure another without benefit to himself?  I can easily
conceive that all are pleased with superiority; but your ignorance was
merely accidental, which, being neither your crime nor your folly, could
afford them no reason to applaud themselves; and the knowledge which they
had, and which you wanted, they might as effectually have shown by
warning as betraying you.”

“Pride,” said Imlac, “is seldom delicate; it will please itself with very
mean advantages, and envy feels not its own happiness but when it may be
compared with the misery of others.  They were my enemies because they
grieved to think me rich, and my oppressors because they delighted to
find me weak.”

“Proceed,” said the Prince; “I doubt not of the facts which you relate,
but imagine that you impute them to mistaken motives.”

“In this company,” said Imlac, “I arrived at Agra, the capital of
Hindostan, the city in which the Great Mogul commonly resides.  I applied
myself to the language of the country, and in a few months was able to
converse with the learned men; some of whom I found morose and reserved,
and others easy and communicative; some were unwilling to teach another
what they had with difficulty learned themselves; and some showed that
the end of their studies was to gain the dignity of instructing.

“To the tutor of the young princes I recommended myself so much that I
was presented to the Emperor as a man of uncommon knowledge.  The Emperor
asked me many questions concerning my country and my travels, and though
I cannot now recollect anything that he uttered above the power of a
common man, he dismissed me astonished at his wisdom and enamoured of his
goodness.

“My credit was now so high that the merchants with whom I had travelled
applied to me for recommendations to the ladies of the Court.  I was
surprised at their confidence of solicitation and greatly reproached them
with their practices on the road.  They heard me with cold indifference,
and showed no tokens of shame or sorrow.

“They then urged their request with the offer of a bribe, but what I
would not do for kindness I would not do for money, and refused them, not
because they had injured me, but because I would not enable them to
injure others; for I knew they would have made use of my credit to cheat
those who should buy their wares.

“Having resided at Agra till there was no more to be learned, I travelled
into Persia, where I saw many remains of ancient magnificence and
observed many new accommodations of life.  The Persians are a nation
eminently social, and their assemblies afforded me daily opportunities of
remarking characters and manners, and of tracing human nature through all
its variations.

“From Persia I passed into Arabia, where I saw a nation pastoral and
warlike, who lived without any settled habitation, whose wealth is their
flocks and herds, and who have carried on through ages an hereditary war
with mankind, though they neither covet nor envy their possessions.”




CHAPTER X
IMLAC’S HISTORY (_continued_)—A DISSERTATION UPON POETRY.


“WHEREVER I went I found that poetry was considered as the highest
learning, and regarded with a veneration somewhat approaching to that
which man would pay to angelic nature.  And yet it fills me with wonder
that in almost all countries the most ancient poets are considered as the
best; whether it be that every other kind of knowledge is an acquisition
greatly attained, and poetry is a gift conferred at once; or that the
first poetry of every nation surprised them as a novelty, and retained
the credit by consent which it received by accident at first; or whether,
as the province of poetry is to describe nature and passion, which are
always the same, the first writers took possession of the most striking
objects for description and the most probable occurrences for fiction,
and left nothing to those that followed them but transcription of the
same events and new combinations of the same images.  Whatever be the
reason, it is commonly observed that the early writers are in possession
of nature, and their followers of art; that the first excel in strength
and invention, and the latter in elegance and refinement.

“I was desirous to add my name to this illustrious fraternity.  I read
all the poets of Persia and Arabia, and was able to repeat by memory the
volumes that are suspended in the mosque of Mecca.  But I soon found that
no man was ever great by imitations.  My desire of excellence impelled me
to transfer my attention to nature and to life.  Nature was to be my
subject, and men to be my auditors.  I could never describe what I had
not seen.  I could not hope to move those with delight or terror whose
interests and opinions I did not understand.

“Being now resolved to be a poet, I saw everything with a new purpose; my
sphere of attention was suddenly magnified; no kind of knowledge was to
be overlooked.  I ranged mountains and deserts for images and
resemblances, and pictured upon my mind every tree of the forest and
flower of the valley.  I observed with equal care the crags of the rock
and the pinnacles of the palace.  Sometimes I wandered along the mazes of
the rivulet, and sometimes watched the changes of the summer clouds.  To
a poet nothing can be useless.  Whatever is beautiful and whatever is
dreadful must be familiar to his imagination; he must be conversant with
all that is awfully vast or elegantly little.  The plants of the garden,
the animals of the wood, the minerals of the earth, and meteors of the
sky, must all concur to store his mind with inexhaustible variety; for
every idea is useful for the enforcement or decoration of moral or
religious truth, and he who knows most will have most power of
diversifying his scenes and of gratifying his reader with remote
allusions and unexpected instruction.

“All the appearances of nature I was therefore careful to study, and
every country which I have surveyed has contributed something to my
poetical powers.”

“In so wide a survey,” said the Prince, “you must surely have left much
unobserved.  I have lived till now within the circuit of the mountains,
and yet cannot walk abroad without the sight of something which I had
never beheld before, or never heeded.”

“This business of a poet,” said Imlac, “is to examine, not the
individual, but the species; to remark general properties and large
appearances.  He does not number the streaks of the tulip, or describe
the different shades of the verdure of the forest.  He is to exhibit in
his portraits of nature such prominent and striking features as recall
the original to every mind, and must neglect the minuter discriminations,
which one may have remarked and another have neglected, for those
characteristics which are alike obvious to vigilance and carelessness.

“But the knowledge of nature is only half the task of a poet; he must be
acquainted likewise with all the modes of life.  His character requires
that he estimate the happiness and misery of every condition, observe the
power of all the passions in all their combinations, and trace the
changes of the human mind, as they are modified by various institutions
and accidental influences of climate or custom, from the sprightliness of
infancy to the despondence of decrepitude.  He must divest himself of the
prejudices of his age and country; he must consider right and wrong in
their abstracted and invariable state; he must disregard present laws and
opinions, and rise to general and transcendental truths, which will
always be the same.  He must, therefore, content himself with the slow
progress of his name, contemn the praise of his own time, and commit his
claims to the justice of posterity.  He must write as the interpreter of
nature and the legislator of mankind, and consider himself as presiding
over the thoughts and manners of future generations, as a being superior
to time and place.

“His labour is not yet at an end.  He must know many languages and many
sciences, and, that his style may be worthy of his thoughts, must by
incessant practice familiarise to himself every delicacy of speech and
grace of harmony.”




CHAPTER XI
IMLAC’S NARRATIVE (_continued_)—A HINT OF PILGRIMAGE.


IMLAC now felt the enthusiastic fit, and was proceeding to aggrandise his
own profession, when then Prince cried out: “Enough! thou hast convinced
me that no human being can ever be a poet.  Proceed with thy narration.”

“To be a poet,” said Imlac, “is indeed very difficult.”

“So difficult,” returned the Prince, “that I will at present hear no more
of his labours.  Tell me whither you went when you had seen Persia.”

“From Persia,” said the poet, “I travelled through Syria, and for three
years resided in Palestine, where I conversed with great numbers of the
northern and western nations of Europe, the nations which are now in
possession of all power and all knowledge, whose armies are irresistible,
and whose fleets command the remotest parts of the globe.  When I
compared these men with the natives of our own kingdom and those that
surround us, they appeared almost another order of beings.  In their
countries it is difficult to wish for anything that may not be obtained;
a thousand arts, of which we never heard, are continually labouring for
their convenience and pleasure, and whatever their own climate has denied
them is supplied by their commerce.”

“By what means,” said the Prince, “are the Europeans thus powerful? or
why, since they can so easily visit Asia and Africa for trade or
conquest, cannot the Asiatics and Africans invade their coast, plant
colonies in their ports, and give laws to their natural princes?  The
same wind that carries them back would bring us thither.”

“They are more powerful, sir, than we,” answered Imlac, “because they are
wiser; knowledge will always predominate over ignorance, as man governs
the other animals.  But why their knowledge is more than ours I know not
what reason can be given but the unsearchable will of the Supreme Being.”

“When,” said the Prince with a sigh, “shall I be able to visit Palestine,
and mingle with this mighty confluence of nations?  Till that happy
moment shall arrive, let me fill up the time with such representations as
thou canst give me.  I am not ignorant of the motive that assembles such
numbers in that place, and cannot but consider it as the centre of wisdom
and piety, to which the best and wisest men of every land must be
continually resorting.”

“There are some nations,” said Imlac, “that send few visitants to
Palestine; for many numerous and learned sects in Europe concur to
censure pilgrimage as superstitious, or deride it as ridiculous.”

“You know,” said the Prince, “how little my life has made me acquainted
with diversity of opinions; it will be too long to hear the arguments on
boere is some
satisfaction more popular and accessible, and that millions can hardly be
subjected to the will of a single man, only to fill his particular breast
with incommunicable content.”

These thoughts were often in his mind, and he found no solution of the
difficulty.  But as presents and civilities gained him more familiarity,
he found that almost every man who stood high in his employment hated all
the rest and was hated by them, and that their lives were a continual
succession of plots and detections, stratagems and escapes, faction and
treachery.  Many of those who surrounded the Bassa were sent only to
watch and report his conduct: every tongue was muttering censure, and
every eye was searching for a fault.

At last the letters of revocation arrived: the Bassa was carried in
chains to Constantinople, and his name was mentioned no more.

“What are we now to think of the prerogatives of power?” said Rasselas to
his sister: “is it without efficacy to good, or is the subordinate degree
only dangerous, and the supreme safe and glorious?  Is the Sultan the
only happy man in his dominions, or is the Sultan himself subject to the
torments of suspicion and the dread of enemies?”

In a short time the second Bassa was deposed.  The Sultan that had
advanced him was murdered by the Janissaries, and his successor had other
views or different favourites.




CHAPTER XXV
THE PRINCESS PURSUES HER INQUIRY WITH MORE DILIGENCE THAN SUCCESS.


THE Princess in the meantime insinuated herself into many families; for
there are few doors through which liberality, joined with good humour,
cannot find its way.  The daughters of many houses were airy and
cheerful; but Nekayah had been too long accustomed to the conversation of
Imlac and her brother to be much pleased with childish levity and prattle
which had no meaning.  She found their thoughts narrow, their wishes low,
and their merriment often artificial.  Their pleasures, poor as they
were, could not be preserved pure, but were embittered by petty
competitions and worthless emulation.  They were always jealous of the
beauty of each other, of a quality to which solicitude can add nothing,
and from which detraction can take nothing away.  Many were in love with
triflers like themselves, and many fancied that they were in love when in
truth they were only idle.  Their affection was not fixed on sense or
virtue, and therefore seldom ended but in vexation.  Their grief,
however, like their joy, was transient; everything floated in their mind
unconnected with the past or future, so that one desire easily gave way
to another, as a second stone, cast into the water, effaces and confounds
the circles of the first.

With these girls she played as with inoffensive animals, and found them
proud of her countenance and weary of her company.

But her purpose was to examine more deeply, and her affability easily
persuaded the hearts that were swelling with sorrow to discharge their
secrets in her ear, and those whom hope flattered or prosperity delighted
often courted her to partake their pleasure.

The Princess and her brother commonly met in the evening in a private
summerhouse on the banks of the Nile, and related to each other the
occurrences of the day.  As they were sitting together the Princess cast
her eyes upon the river that flowed before her.  “Answer,” said she,
“great father of waters, thou that rollest thy goods through eighty
nations, to the invocations of the daughter of thy native king.  Tell me
if thou waterest through all thy course a single habitation from which
thou dost not hear the murmurs of complaint.”

“You are then,” said Rasselas, “not more successful in private houses
than I have been in Courts.”  “I have, since the last partition of our
provinces,” said the Princess, “enabled myself to enter familiarly into
many families, where there was the fairest show of prosperity and peace,
and know not one house that is not haunted by some fury that destroys
their quiet.

“I did not seek ease among the poor, because I concluded that there it
could not be found.  But I saw many poor whom I had supposed to live in
affluence.  Poverty has in large cities very different appearances.  It
is often concealed in splendour and often in extravagance.  It is the
care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their indigence from the
rest.  They support themselves by temporary expedients, and every day is
lost in contriving for the morrow.

“This, however, was an evil which, though frequent, I saw with less pain,
because I could relieve it.  Yet some have refused my bounties; more
offended with my quickness to detect their wants than pleased with my
readiness to succour them; and others, whose exigencies compelled them to
admit my kindness, have never been able to forgive their benefactress.
Many, however, have been sincerely grateful without the ostentation of
gratitude or the hope of other favours.”




CHAPTER XXVI
THE PRINCESS CONTINUES HER REMARKS UPON PRIVATE LIFE.


NEKAYAH, perceiving her brother’s attention fixed, proceeded in her
narrative.

“In families where there is or is not poverty there is commonly discord.
If a kingdom be, as Imlac tells us, a great family, a family likewise is
a little kingdom, torn with factions and exposed to revolutions.  An
unpractised observer expects the love of parents and children to be
constant and equal.  But this kindness seldom continues beyond the years
of infancy; in a short time the children become rivals to their parents.
Benefits are allowed by reproaches, and gratitude debased by envy.

“Parents and children seldom act in concert; each child endeavours to
appropriate the esteem or the fondness of the parents; and the parents,
with yet less temptation, betray each other to their children.  Thus,
some place their confidence in the father and some in the mother, and by
degrees the house is filled with artifices and feuds.

“The opinions of children and parents, of the young and the old, are
naturally opposite, by the contrary effects of hope and despondency, of
expectation and experience, without crime or folly on either side.  The
colours of life in youth and age appear different, as the face of Nature
in spring and winter.  And how can children credit the assertions of
parents which their own eyes show them to be false?

“Few parents act in such a manner as much to enforce their maxims by the
credit of their lives.  The old man trusts wholly to slow contrivance and
gradual progression; the youth expects to force his way by genius,
vigour, and precipitance.  The old man pays regard to riches, and the
youth reverences virtue.  The old man deifies prudence; the youth commits
himself to magnanimity and chance.  The young man, who intends no ill,
believes that none is intended, and therefore acts with openness and
candour; but his father; having suffered the injuries of fraud, is
impelled to suspect and too often allured to practise it.  Age looks with
anger on the temerity of youth, and youth with contempt on the
scrupulosity of age.  Thus parents and children for the greatest part
live on to love less and less; and if those whom Nature has thus closely
united are the torments of each other, where shall we look for tenderness
and consolations?”

“Surely,” said the Prince, “you must have been unfortunate in your choice
of acquaintance.  I am unwilling to believe that the most tender of all
relations is thus impeded in its effects by natural necessity.”

“Domestic discord,” answered she, “is not inevitably and fatally
necessary, but yet it is not easily avoided.  We seldom see that a whole
family is virtuous; the good and the evil cannot well agree, and the evil
can yet less agree with one another.  Even the virtuous fall sometimes to
variance, when their virtues are of different kinds and tending to
extremes.  In general, those parents have most reverence who most deserve
it, for he that lives well cannot be despised.

“Many other evils infest private life.  Some are the slaves of servants
whom they have trusted with their affairs.  Some are kept in continual
anxiety by the caprice of rich relations, whom they cannot please and
dare not offend.  Some husbands are imperious and some wives perverse,
and, as it is always more easy to do evil than good, though the wisdom or
virtue of one can very rarely make many happy, the folly or vice of one
makes many miserable.”

“If such be the general effect of marriage,” said the Prince, “I shall
for the future think it dangerous to connect my interest with that of
another, lest I should be unhappy by my partner’s fault.”

“I have met,” said the Princess, “with many who live single for that
reason, but I never found that their prudence ought to raise envy.  They
dream away their time without friendship, without fondness, and are
driven to rid themselves of the day, for which they have no use, by
childish amusements or vicious delights.  They act as beings under the
constant sense of some known inferiority that fills their minds with
rancour and their tongues with censure.  They are peevish at home and
malevolent abroad, and, as the outlaws of human nature, make it their
business and their pleasure to disturb that society which debars them
from its privileges.  To live without feeling or exciting sympathy, to be
fortunate without adding to the felicity of others, or afflicted without
tasting the balm of pity, is a state more gloomy than solitude; it is not
retreat but exclusion from mankind.  Marriage has many pains, but
celibacy has no pleasures.”

“What then is to be done?” said Rasselas.  “The more we inquire the less
we can resolve.  Surely he is most likely to please himself that has no
other inclination to regard.”




CHAPTER XXVII
DISQUISITION UPON GREATNESS.


THE conversation had a short pause.  The Prince, having considered his
sister’s observation, told her that she had surveyed life with prejudice
and supposed misery where she did not find it.  “Your narrative,” says
he, “throws yet a darker gloom upon the prospects of futurity.  The
predictions of Imlac were but faint sketches of the evils painted by
Nekayah.  I have been lately convinced that quiet is not the daughter of
grandeur or of power; that her presence is not to be bought by wealth nor
enforced by conquest.  It is evident that as any man acts in a wider
compass he must be more exposed to opposition from enmity or miscarriage
from chance.  Whoever has many to please or to govern must use the
ministry of many agents, some of whom will be wicked and some ignorant,
by some he will be misled and by others betrayed.  If he gratifies one he
will offend another; those that are not favoured will think themselves
injured, and since favours can be conferred but upon few the greater
number will be always discontented.”

“The discontent,” said the Princess, “which is thus unreasonable, I hope
that I shall always have spirit to despise and you power to repress.”

“Discontent,” answered Rasselas, “will not always be without reason under
the most just and vigilant administration of public affairs.  None,
however attentive, can always discover that merit which indigence or
faction may happen to obscure, and none, however powerful, can always
reward it.  Yet he that sees inferior desert advanced above him will
naturally impute that preference to partiality or caprice, and indeed it
can scarcely be hoped that any man, however magnanimous by Nature or
exalted by condition, will be able to persist for ever in fixed and
inexorable justice of distribution; he will sometimes indulge his own
affections and sometimes those of his favourites; he will permit some to
please him who can never serve him; he will discover in those whom he
loves qualities which in reality they do not possess, and to those from
whom he receives pleasure he will in his turn endeavour to give it.  Thus
will recommendations sometimes prevail which were purchased by money or
by the more destructive bribery of flattery and servility.

“He that hath much to do will do something wrong, and of that wrong must
suffer the consequences, and if it were possible that he should always
act rightly, yet, when such numbers are to judge of his conduct, the bad
will censure and obstruct him by malevolence and the good sometimes by
mistake.

“The highest stations cannot therefore hope to be the abodes of
happiness, which I would willingly believe to have fled from thrones and
palaces to seats of humble privacy and placid obscurity.  For what can
hinder the satisfaction or intercept the expectations of him whose
abilities are adequate to his employments, who sees with his own eyes the
whole circuit of his influence, who chooses by his own knowledge all whom
he trusts, and whom none are tempted to deceive by hope or fear?  Surely
he has nothing to do but to love and to be loved; to be virtuous and to
be happy.”

“Whether perfect happiness would be procured by perfect goodness,” said
Nekayah, “this world will never afford an opportunity of deciding.  But
this, at least, may be maintained, that we do not always find visible
happiness in proportion to visible virtue.  All natural and almost all
political evils are incident alike to the bad and good; they are
confounded in the misery of a famine, and not much distinguished in the
fury of a faction; they sink together in a tempest and are driven
together from their country by invaders.  All that virtue can afford is
quietness of conscience and a steady prospect of a happier state; this
may enable us to endure calamity with patience, but remember that
patience must oppose pain.”




CHAPTER XXVIII
RASSELAS AND NEKAYAH CONTINUE THEIR CONVERSATION.


“DEAR Princess,” said Rasselas, “you fall into the common errors of
exaggeratory declamation, by producing in a familiar disquisition
examples of national calamities and scenes of extensive misery which are
found in books rather than in the world, and which, as they are horrid,
are ordained to be rare.  Let us not imagine evils which we do not feel,
nor injure life by misrepresentations.  I cannot bear that querulous
eloquence which threatens every city with a siege like that of Jerusalem,
that makes famine attend on every flight of locust, and suspends
pestilence on the wing of every blast that issues from the south.

“On necessary and inevitable evils which overwhelm kingdoms at once all
disputation is vain; when they happen they must be endured.  But it is
evident that these bursts of universal distress are more dreaded than
felt; thousands and tens of thousands flourish in youth and wither in
age, without the knowledge of any other than domestic evils, and share
the same pleasures and vexations, whether their kings are mild or cruel,
whether the armies of their country pursue their enemies or retreat
before them.  While Courts are disturbed with intestine competitions and
ambassadors are negotiating in foreign countries, the smith still plies
his anvil and the husbandman drives his plough forward; the necessaries
of life are required and obtained, and the successive business of the
season continues to make its wonted revolutions.

“Let us cease to consider what perhaps may never happen, and what, when
it shall happen, will laugh at human speculation.  We will not endeavour
to modify the motions of the elements or to fix the destiny of kingdoms.
It is our business to consider what beings like us may perform, each
labouring for his own happiness by promoting within his circle, however
narrow, the happiness of others.

“Marriage is evidently the dictate of Nature; men and women were made to
be the companions of each other, and therefore I cannot be persuaded but
that marriage is one of the means of happiness.”

“I know not,” said the Princess, “whether marriage be more than one of
the innumerable modes of human misery.  When I see and reckon the various
forms of connubial infelicity, the unexpected causes of lasting discord,
the diversities of temper, the oppositions of opinion, the rude
collisions of contrary desire where both are urged by violent impulses,
the obstinate contest of disagreeing virtues where both are supported by
consciousness of good intention, I am sometimes disposed to think, with
the severer casuists of most nations, that marriage is rather permitted
than approved, and that none, but by the instigation of a passion too
much indulged, entangle themselves with indissoluble compact.”

“You seem to forget,” replied Rasselas, “that you have, even now
represented celibacy as less happy than marriage.  Both conditions may be
bad, but they cannot both be worse.  Thus it happens, when wrong opinions
are entertained, that they mutually destroy each other and leave the mind
open to truth.”

“I did not expect,” answered, the Princess, “to hear that imputed to
falsehood which is the consequence only of frailty.  To the mind, as to
the eye, it is difficult to compare with exactness objects vast in their
extent and various in their parts.  When we see or conceive the whole at
once, we readily note the discriminations and decide the preference, but
of two systems, of which neither can be surveyed by any human being in
its full compass of magnitude and multiplicity of complication, where is
the wonder that, judging of the whole by parts, I am alternately affected
by one and the other as either presses on my memory or fancy?  We differ
from ourselves just as we differ from each other when we see only part of
the question, as in the multifarious relations of politics and morality,
but when we perceive the whole at once, as in numerical computations, all
agree in one judgment, and none ever varies in his opinion.”

“Let us not add,” said the Prince, “to the other evils of life the
bitterness of controversy, nor endeavour to vie with each other in
subtilties of argument.  We are employed in a search of which both are
equally to enjoy the success or suffer by the miscarriage; it is
therefore fit that we assist each other.  You surely conclude too hastily
from the infelicity of marriage against its institution; will not the
misery of life prove equally that life cannot be the gift of Heaven?  The
world must be peopled by marriage or peopled without it.”

“How the world is to be peopled,” returned Nekayah, “is not my care and
need not be yours.  I see no danger that the present generation should
omit to leave successors behind them; we are not now inquiring for the
world, but for ourselves.”




CHAPTER XXIX
THE DEBATE ON MARRIAGE (_continued_).


“THE good of the whole,” says Rasselas, “is the same with the good of all
its parts.  If marriage be best for mankind, it must be evidently best
for individuals; or a permanent and necessary duty must be the cause of
evil, and some must be inevitably sacrificed to the convenience of
others.  In the estimate which you have made of the two states, it
appears that the incommodities of a single life are in a great measure
necessary and certain, but those of the conjugal state accidental and
avoidable.  I cannot forbear to flatter myself that prudence and
benevolence will make marriage happy.  The general folly of mankind is
the cause of general complaint.  What can be expected but disappointment
and repentance from a choice made in the immaturity of youth, in the
ardour of desire, without judgment, without foresight, without inquiry
after conformity of opinions, similarity of manners, rectitude of
judgment, or purity of sentiment?

“Such is the common process of marriage.  A youth and maiden, meeting by
chance or brought together by artifice, exchange glances, reciprocate
civilities, go home and dream of one another.  Having little to divert
attention or diversify thought, they find themselves uneasy when they are
apart, and therefore conclude that they shall be happy together.  They
marry, and discover what nothing but voluntary blindness before had
concealed; they wear out life in altercations, and charge Nature with
cruelty.

“From those early marriages proceeds likewise the rivalry of parents and
children: the son is eager to enjoy the world before the father is
willing to forsake it, and there is hardly room at once for two
generations.  The daughter begins to bloom before the mother can be
content to fade, and neither can forbear to wish for the absence of the
other.

“Surely all these evils may be avoided by that deliberation and delay
which prudence prescribes to irrevocable choice.  In the variety and
jollity of youthful pleasures, life may be well enough supported without
the help of a partner.  Longer time will increase experience, and wider
views will allow better opportunities of inquiry and selection; one
advantage at least will be certain, the parents will be visibly older
than their children.”

“What reason cannot collect,” and Nekayah, “and what experiment has not
yet taught, can be known only from the report of others.  I have been
told that late marriages are not eminently happy.  This is a question too
important to be neglected; and I have often proposed it to those whose
accuracy of remark and comprehensiveness of knowledge made their
suffrages worthy of regard.  They have generally determined that it is
dangerous for a man and woman to suspend their fate upon each other at a
time when opinions are fixed and habits are established, when friendships
have been contracted on both sides, when life has been planned into
method, and the mind has long enjoyed the contemplation of its own
prospects.

“It is scarcely possible that two travelling through the world under the
conduct of chance should have been both directed to the same path, and it
will not often happen that either will quit the track which custom has
made pleasing.  When the desultory levity of youth has settled into
regularity, it is soon succeeded by pride ashamed to yield, or obstinacy
delighting to contend.  And even though mutual esteem produces mutual
desire to please, time itself, as it modifies unchangeably the external
mien, determines likewise the direction of the passions, and gives an
inflexible rigidity to the manners.  Long customs are not easily broken;
he that attempts to change the course of his own life very often labours
in vain, and how shall we do that for others which we are seldom able to
do for ourselves?”

“But surely,” interposed the Prince, “you suppose the chief motive of
choice forgotten or neglected.  Whenever I shall seek a wife, it shall be
my first question whether she be willing to be led by reason.”

“Thus it is,” said Nekayah, “that philosophers are deceived.  There are a
thousand familiar disputes which reason never can decide; questions that
elude investigation, and make logic ridiculous; cases where something
must be done, and where little can be said.  Consider the state of
mankind, and inquire how few can be supposed to act upon any occasions,
whether small or great, with all the reasons of action present to their
minds.  Wretched would be the pair, above all names of wretchedness, who
should be doomed to adjust by reason every morning all the minute details
of a domestic day.

“Those who marry at an advanced age will probably escape the
encroachments of their children, but in the diminution of this advantage
they will be likely to leave them, ignorant and helpless, to a guardian’s
mercy; or if that should not happen, they must at least go out of the
world before they see those whom they love best either wise or great.

“From their children, if they have less to fear, they have less also to
hope; and they lose without equivalent the joys of early love, and the
convenience of uniting with manners pliant and minds susceptible of new
impressions, which might wear away their dissimilitudes by long
cohabitation, as soft bodies by continual attrition conform their
surfaces to each other.

“I believe it will be found that those who marry late are best pleased
with their children, and those who marry early with their partners.”

“The union of these two affections,” said Rasselas, “would produce all
that could be wished.  Perhaps there is a time when marriage might unite
them—a time neither too early for the father nor too late for the
husband.”

“Every hour,” answered the Princess, “confirms my prejudice in favour of
the position so often uttered by the mouth of Imlac, that ‘Nature sets
her gifts on the right hand and on the left.’  Those conditions which
flatter hope and attract desire are so constituted that as we approach
one we recede from another.  There are goods so opposed that we cannot
seize both, but by too much prudence may pass between them at too great a
distance to reach either.  This is often the fate of long consideration;
he does nothing who endeavours to do more than is allowed to humanity.
Flatter not yourself with contrarieties of pleasure.  Of the blessings
set before you make your choice, and be content.  No man can taste the
fruits of autumn while he is delighting his scent with the flowers of the
spring; no man can at the same time fill his cup from the source and from
the mouth of the Nile.”




CHAPTER XXX
IMLAC ENTERS, AND CHANGES THE CONVERSATION.


HERE Imlac entered, and interrupted them.  “Imlac,” said Rasselas, “I
have been taking from the Princess the dismal history of private life,
and am almost discouraged from further search.”

“It seems to me,” said Imlac, “that while you are making the choice of
life you neglect to live.  You wander about a single city, which, however
large and diversified, can now afford few novelties, and forget that you
are in a country famous among the earliest monarchies for the power and
wisdom of its inhabitants—a country where the sciences first dawned that
illuminate the world, and beyond which the arts cannot be traced of civil
society or domestic life.

“The old Egyptians have left behind them monuments of industry and power
before which all European magnificence is confessed to fade away.  The
ruins of their architecture are the schools of modern builders; and from
the wonders which time has spared we may conjecture, though uncertainly,
what it has destroyed.”

“My curiosity,” said Rasselas, “does not very strongly lead me to survey
piles of stone or mounds of earth.  My business is with man.  I came
hither not to measure fragments of temples or trace choked aqueducts, but
to look upon the various scenes of the present world.”

“The things that are now before us,” said the Princess, “require
attention, and deserve it.  What have I to do with the heroes or the
monuments of ancient times—with times which can never return, and heroes
whose form of life was different from all that the present condition of
mankind requires or allows?”

“To know anything,” returned the poet, “we must know its effects; to see
men, we must see their works, that we may learn what reason has dictated
or passion has excited, and find what are the most powerful motives of
action.  To judge rightly of the present, we must oppose it to the past;
for all judgment is comparative, and of the future nothing can be known.
The truth is that no mind is much employed upon the present; recollection
and anticipation fill up almost all our moments.  Our passions are joy
and grief, love and hatred, hope and fear.  Of joy and grief, the past is
the object, and the future of hope and fear; even love and hatred respect
the past, for the cause must have been before the effect.

“The present state of things is the consequence of the former; and it is
natural to inquire what were the sources of the good that we enjoy, or
the evils that we suffer.  If we act only for ourselves, to neglect the
study of history is not prudent.  If we are entrusted with the care of
others, it is not just.  Ignorance, when it is voluntary, is criminal;
and he may properly be charged with evil who refused to learn how he
might prevent it.

“There is no part of history so generally useful as that which relates to
the progress of the human mind, the gradual improvement of reason, the
successive advances of science, the vicissitudes of learning and
ignorance (which are the light and darkness of thinking beings), the
extinction and resuscitation of arts, and the revolutions of the
intellectual world.  If accounts of battles and invasions are peculiarly
the business of princes, the useful or elegant arts are not to be
neglected; those who have kingdoms to govern have understandings to
cultivate.

“Example is always more efficacious than precept.  A soldier is formed in
war, and a painter must copy pictures.  In this, contemplative life has
the advantage.  Great actions are seldom seen, but the labours of art are
always at hand for those who desire to know what art has been able to
perform.

“When the eye or the imagination is struck with any uncommon work, the
next transition of an active mind is to the means by which it was
performed.  Here begins the true use of such contemplation.  We enlarge
our comprehension by new ideas, and perhaps recover some art lost to
mankind, or learn what is less perfectly known in our own country.  At
least we compare our own with former times, and either rejoice at our
improvements, or, what is the first motion towards good, discover our
defects.”

“I am willing,” said the Prince, “to see all that can deserve my search.”

“And I,” said the Princess, “shall rejoice to learn something of the
manners of antiquity.”

“The most pompous monument of Egyptian greatness, and one of the most
bulky works of manual industry,” said Imlac, “are the Pyramids: fabrics
raised before the time of history, and of which the earliest narratives
afford us only uncertain traditions.  Of these the greatest is still
standing, very little injured by time.”

“Let us visit them to-morrow,” said Nekayah.  “I have often heard of the
Pyramids, and shall not rest till I have seen them, within and without,
with my own eyes.”




CHAPTER XXXI
THEY VISIT THE PYRAMIDS.


THE resolution being thus taken, they set out the next day.  They laid
tents upon their camels, being resolved to stay among the Pyramids till
their curiosity was fully satisfied.  They travelled gently, turned aside
to everything remarkable, stopped from time to time and conversed with
the inhabitants, and observed the various appearances of towns ruined and
inhabited, of wild and cultivated nature.

When they came to the Great Pyramid they were astonished at the extent of
the base and the height of the top.  Imlac explained to them the
principles upon which the pyramidal form was chosen for a fabric intended
to co-extend its duration with that of the world: he showed that its
gradual diminution gave it such stability as defeated all the common
attacks of the elements, and could scarcely be overthrown by earthquakes
themselves, the least resistible of natural violence.  A concussion that
should shatter the pyramid would threaten the dissolution of the
continent.

They measured all its dimensions, and pitched their tents at its foot.
Next day they prepared to enter its interior apartments, and having hired
the common guides, climbed up to the first passage; when the favourite of
the Princess, looking into the cavity, stepped back and trembled.
“Pekuah,” said the Princess, “of what art thou afraid?”

“Of the narrow entrance,” answered the lady, “and of the dreadful gloom.
I dare not enter a place which must surely be inhabited by unquiet souls.
The original possessors of these dreadful vaults will start up before us,
and perhaps shut us in for ever.”  She spoke, and threw her arms round
the neck of her mistress.

“If all your fear be of apparitions,” said the Prince, “I will promise
you safety.  There is no danger from the dead: he that is once buried
will be seen no more.”

“That the dead are seen no more,” said Imlac, “I will not undertake to
maintain against the concurrent and unvaried testimony of all ages and of
all nations.  There is no people, rude or learned, among whom apparitions
of the dead are not related and believed.  This opinion, which perhaps
prevails as far as human nature is diffused, could become universal only
by its truth: those that never heard of one another would not have agreed
in a tale which nothing but experience can make credible.  That it is
doubted by single cavillers can very little weaken the general evidence,
and some who deny it with their tongues confess it by their fears.

“Yet I do not mean to add new terrors to those which have already seized
upon Pekuah.  There can be no reason why spectres should haunt the
Pyramid more than other places, or why they should have power or will to
hurt innocence and purity.  Our entrance is no violation of their
privileges: we can take nothing from them; how, then, can we offend
them?”

“My dear Pekuah,” said the Princess, “I will always go before you, and
Imlac shall follow you.  Remember that you are the companion of the
Princess of Abyssinia.”

“If the Princess is pleased that her servant should die,” returned the
lady, “let her command some death less dreadful than enclosure in this
horrid cavern.  You know I dare not disobey you—I must go if you command
me; but if I once enter, I never shall come back.”

The Princess saw that her fear was too strong for expostulation or
reproof, and, embracing her, told her that she should stay in the tent
till their return.  Pekuah was not yet satisfied, but entreated the
Princess not to pursue so dreadful a purpose as that of entering the
recesses of the Pyramids.  “Though I cannot teach courage,” said Nekayah,
“I must not learn cowardice, nor leave at last undone what I came hither
only to do.”




CHAPTER XXXII
THEY ENTER THE PYRAMID.


PEKUAH descended to the tents, and the rest entered the Pyramid.  They
passed through the galleries, surveyed the vaults of marble, and examined
the chest in which the body of the founder is supposed to have been
deposited.  They then sat down in one of the most spacious chambers to
rest awhile before they attempted to return.

“We have now,” said Imlac, “gratified our minds with an exact view of the
greatest work of man, except the wall of China.

“Of the wall it is very easy to assign the motive.  It secured a wealthy
and timorous nation from the incursions of barbarians, whose
unskilfulness in the arts made it easier for them to supply their wants
by rapine than by industry, and who from time to time poured in upon the
inhabitants of peaceful commerce as vultures descend upon domestic fowl.
Their celerity and fierceness made the wall necessary, and their
ignorance made it efficacious.

“But for the Pyramids, no reason has ever been given adequate to the cost
and labour of the work.  The narrowness of the chambers proves that it
could afford no retreat from enemies, and treasures might have been
reposited at far less expense with equal security.  It seems to have been
erected only in compliance with that hunger of imagination which preys
incessantly upon life, and must be always appeased by some employment.
Those who have already all that they can enjoy must enlarge their
desires.  He that has built for use till use is supplied must begin to
build for vanity, and extend his plan to the utmost power of human
performance that he may not be soon reduced to form another wish.

“I consider this mighty structure as a monument of the insufficiency of
human enjoyments.  A king whose power is unlimited, and whose treasures
surmount all real and imaginary wants, is compelled to solace, by the
erection of a pyramid, the satiety of dominion and tastelessness of
pleasures, and to amuse the tediousness of declining life by seeing
thousands labouring without end, and one stone, for no purpose, laid upon
another.  Whoever thou art that, not content with a moderate condition,
imaginest happiness in royal magnificence, and dreamest that command or
riches can feed the appetite of novelty with perpetual gratifications,
survey the Pyramids, and confess thy folly!”




CHAPTER XXXIII
THE PRINCESS MEETS WITH AN UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNE.


THEY rose up, and returned through the cavity at which they had entered;
and the Princess prepared for her favourite a long narrative of dark
labyrinths and costly rooms, and of the different impressions which the
varieties of the way had made upon her.  But when they came to their
train, they found every one silent and dejected: the men discovered shame
and fear in their countenances, and the women were weeping in their
tents.

What had happened they did not try to conjecture, but immediately
inquired.  “You had scarcely entered into the Pyramid,” said one of the
attendants, “when a troop of Arabs rushed upon us: we were too few to
resist them, and too slow to escape.  They were about to search the
tents, set us on our camels, and drive us along before them, when the
approach of some Turkish horsemen put them to flight: but they seized the
Lady Pekuah with her two maids, and carried them away: the Turks are now
pursuing them by our instigation, but I fear they will not be able to
overtake them.”

The Princess was overpowered with surprise and grief.  Rasselas, in the
first heat of his resentment, ordered his servants to follow him, and
prepared to pursue the robbers with his sabre in his hand.  “Sir,” said
Imlac, “what can you hope from violence or valour?  The Arabs are mounted
on horses trained to battle and retreat; we have only beasts of burden.
By leaving our present station we may lose the Princess, but cannot hope
to regain Pekuah.”

In a short time the Turks returned, having not been able to reach the
enemy.  The Princess burst out into new lamentations, and Rasselas could
scarcely forbear to reproach them with cowardice; but Imlac was of
opinion that the escape of the Arabs was no addition to their misfortune,
for perhaps they would have killed their captives rather than have
resigned them.




CHAPTER XXXIV
THEY RETURN TO CAIRO WITHOUT PEKUAH.


THERE was nothing to be hoped from longer stay.  They returned to Cairo,
repenting of their curiosity, censuring the negligence of the government,
lamenting their own rashness, which had neglected to procure a guard,
imagining many expedients by which the loss of Pekuah might have been
prevented, and resolving to do something for her recovery, though none
could find anything proper to be done.

Nekayah retired to her chamber, where her women attempted to comfort her
by telling her that all had their troubles, and that Lady Pekuah had
enjoyed much happiness in the world for a long time, and might reasonably
expect a change of fortune.  They hoped that some good would befall her
wheresoever she was, and that their mistress would find another friend
who might supply her place.

The Princess made them no answer; and they continued the form of
condolence, not much grieved in their hearts that the favourite was lost.

Next day the Prince presented to the Bassa a memorial of the wrong which
he had suffered, and a petition for redress.  The Bassa threatened to
punish the robbers, but did not attempt to catch them; nor indeed could
any account or description be given by which he might direct the pursuit.

It soon appeared that nothing would be done by authority.  Governors
being accustomed to hear of more crimes than they can punish, and more
wrongs than they can redress, set themselves at ease by indiscriminate
negligence, and presently forget the request when they lose sight of the
petitioner.

Imlac then endeavoured to gain some intelligence by private agents.  He
found many who pretended to an exact knowledge of all the haunts of the
Arabs, and to regular correspondence with their chiefs, and who readily
undertook the recovery of Pekuah.  Of these, some were furnished with
money for their journey, and came back no more; some were liberally paid
for accounts which a few days discovered to be false.  But the Princess
would not suffer any means, however improbable, to be left untried.
While she was doing something, she kept her hope alive.  As one expedient
failed, another was suggested; when one messenger returned unsuccessful,
another was despatched to a different quarter.

Two months had now passed, and of Pekuah nothing had been heard; the
hopes which they had endeavoured to raise in each other grew more
languid; and the Princess, when she saw nothing more to be tried, sunk
down inconsolable in hopeless dejection.  A thousand times she reproached
herself with the easy compliance by which she permitted her favourite to
stay behind her.  “Had not my fondness,” said she, “lessened my
authority, Pekuah had not dared to talk of her terrors.  She ought to
have feared me more than spectres.  A severe look would have overpowered
her; a peremptory command would have compelled obedience.  Why did
foolish indulgence prevail upon me?  Why did I not speak, and refuse to
hear?”

“Great Princess,” said Imlac, “do not reproach yourself for your virtue,
or consider that as blameable by which evil has accidentally been caused.
Your tenderness for the timidity of Pekuah was generous and kind.  When
we act according to our duty, we commit the events to Him by whose laws
our actions are governed, and who will suffer none to be finally punished
for obedience.  When, in prospect of some good, whether natural or moral,
we break the rules prescribed us, we withdraw from the direction of
superior wisdom, and take all consequences upon ourselves.  Man cannot so
far know the connection of causes and events as that he may venture to do
wrong in order to do right.  When we pursue our end by lawful means, we
may always console our miscarriage by the hope of future recompense.
When we consult only our own policy, and attempt to find a nearer way to
good by over-leaping the settled boundaries of right and wrong, we cannot
be happy even by success, because we cannot escape the consciousness of
our fault; but if we miscarry, the disappointment is irremediably
embittered.  How comfortless is the sorrow of him who feels at once the
pangs of guilt and the vexation of calamity which guilt has brought upon
him!

“Consider, Princess, what would have been your condition if the Lady
Pekuah had entreated to accompany you, and, being compelled to stay in
the tents, had been carried away; or how would you have borne the thought
if you had forced her into the Pyramid, and she had died before you in
agonies of terror?”

“Had either happened,” said Nekayah, “I could not have endured life till
now; I should have been tortured to madness by the remembrance of such
cruelty, or must have pined away in abhorrence of myself.”

“This, at least,” said Imlac, “is the present reward of virtuous conduct,
that no unlucky consequence can oblige us to repent it.”




CHAPTER XXXV
THE PRINCESS LANGUISHES FOR WANT OF PEKUAH.


NEKAYAH, being thus reconciled to herself, found that no evil is
insupportable but that which is accompanied with consciousness of wrong.
She was from that time delivered from the violence of tempestuous sorrow,
and sunk into silent pensiveness and gloomy tranquillity.  She sat from
morning to evening recollecting all that had been done or said by her
Pekuah, treasured up with care every trifle on which Pekuah had set an
accidental value, and which might recall to mind any little incident or
careless conversation.  The sentiments of her whom she now expected to
see no more were treasured in her memory as rules of life, and she
deliberated to no other end than to conjecture on any occasion what would
have been the opinion and counsel of Pekuah.

The women by whom she was attended knew nothing of her real condition,
and therefore she could not talk to them but with caution and reserve.
She began to remit her curiosity, having no great desire to collect
notions which she had no convenience of uttering.  Rasselas endeavoured
first to comfort and afterwards to divert her; he hired musicians, to
whom she seemed to listen, but did not hear them; and procured masters to
instruct her in various arts, whose lectures, when they visited her
again, were again to be repeated.  She had lost her taste of pleasure and
her ambition of excellence; and her mind, though forced into short
excursions, always recurred to the image of her friend.

Imlac was every morning earnestly enjoined to renew his inquiries, and
was asked every night whether he had yet heard of Pekuah; till, not being
able to return the Princess the answer that she desired, he was less and
less willing to come into her presence.  She observed his backwardness,
and commanded him to attend her.   “You are not,” said she, “to confound
impatience with resentment, or to suppose that I charge you with
negligence because I repine at your unsuccessfulness.  I do not much
wonder at your absence.  I know that the unhappy are never pleasing, and
that all naturally avoid the contagion of misery.  To hear complaints is
wearisome alike to the wretched and the happy; for who would cloud by
adventitious grief the short gleams of gaiety which life allows us, or
who that is struggling under his own evils will add to them the miseries
of another?

“The time is at hand when none shall be disturbed any longer by the sighs
of Nekayah: my search after happiness is now at an end.  I am resolved to
retire from the world, with all its flatteries and deceits, and will hide
myself in solitude, without any other care than to compose my thoughts
and regulate my hours by a constant succession of innocent occupations,
till, with a mind purified from earthly desires, I shall enter into that
state to which all are hastening, and in which I hope again to enjoy the
friendship of Pekuah.”

“Do not entangle your mind,” said Imlac, “by irrevocable determinations,
nor increase the burden of life by a voluntary accumulation of misery.
The weariness of retirement will continue to increase when the loss of
Pekuah is forgot.  That you have been deprived of one pleasure is no very
good reason for rejection of the rest.”

“Since Pekuah was taken from me,” said the Princess, “I have no pleasure
to reject or to retain.  She that has no one to love or trust has little
to hope.  She wants the radical principle of happiness.  We may perhaps
allow that what satisfaction this world can afford must arise from the
conjunction of wealth, knowledge, and goodness.  Wealth is nothing but as
it is bestowed, and knowledge nothing but as it is communicated.  They
must therefore be imparted to others, and to whom could I now delight to
impart them?  Goodness affords the only comfort which can be enjoyed
without a partner, and goodness may be practised in retirement.”

“How far solitude may admit goodness or advance it, I shall not,” replied
Imlac, “dispute at present.  Remember the confession of the pious hermit.
You will wish to return into the world when the image of your companion
has left your thoughts.”

“That time,” said Nekayah, “will never come.  The generous frankness, the
modest obsequiousness, and the faithful secrecy of my dear Pekuah will
always be more missed as I shall live longer to see vice and folly.”

“The state of a mind oppressed with a sudden calamity,” said Imlac, “is
like that of the fabulous inhabitants of the new-created earth, who, when
the first night came upon them, supposed that day would never return.
When the clouds of sorrow gather over us, we see nothing beyond them, nor
can imagine how they will be dispelled; yet a new day succeeded to the
night, and sorrow is never long without a dawn of ease.  But they who
restrain themselves from receiving comfort do as the savages would have
done had they put out their eyes when it was dark.  Our minds, like our
bodies, are in continual flux; something is hourly lost, and something
acquired.  To lose much at once is inconvenient to either, but while the
vital power remains uninjured, nature will find the means of reparation.
Distance has the same effect on the mind as on the eye; and while we
glide along the stream of time, whatever we leave behind us is always
lessening, and that which we approach increasing in magnitude.  Do not
suffer life to stagnate: it will grow muddy for want of motion; commit
yourself again to the current of the world; Pekuah will vanish by
degrees; you will meet in your way some other favourite, or learn to
diffuse yourself in general conversation.”

“At least,” said the Prince, “do not despair before all remedies have
been tried.  The inquiry after the unfortunate lady is still continued,
and shall be carried on with yet greater diligence, on condition that you
will promise to wait a year for the event, without any unalterable
resolution.”

Nekayah thought this a reasonable demand, and made the promise to her
brother, who had been obliged by Imlac to require it.  Imlac had, indeed,
no great hope of regaining Pekuah; but he supposed that if he could
secure the interval of a year, the Princess would be then in no danger of
a cloister.




CHAPTER XXXVI
PEKUAH IS STILL REMEMBERED.  THE PROGRESS OF SORROW.


NEKAYAH, seeing that nothing was omitted for the recovery of her
favourite, and having by her promise set her intention of retirement at a
distance, began imperceptibly to return to common cares and common
pleasures.  She rejoiced without her own consent at the suspension of her
sorrows, and sometimes caught herself with indignation in the act of
turning away her mind from the remembrance of her whom yet she resolved
never to forget.

She then appointed a certain hour of the day for meditation on the merits
and fondness of Pekuah, and for some weeks retired constany when they give it pain; but when melancholy notions take
the form of duty, they lay hold on the faculties without opposition,
because we are afraid to exclude or banish them.  For this reason the
superstitious are often melancholy, and the melancholy almost always
superstitious.

“But do not let the suggestions of timidity overpower your better reason;
the danger of neglect can be but as the probability of the obligation,
which, when you consider it with freedom, you find very little, and that
little growing every day less.  Open your heart to the influence of the
light, which from time to time breaks in upon you; when scruples
importune you, which you in your lucid moments know to be vain, do not
stand to parley, but fly to business or to Pekuah; and keep this thought
always prevalent, that you are only one atom of the mass of humanity, and
have neither such virtue nor vice as that you should be singled out for
supernatural favours or afflictions.”




CHAPTER XLVII
THE PRINCE ENTERS, AND BRINGS A NEW TOPIC.


“ALL this,” said the astronomer, “I have often thought; but my reason has
been so long subjugated by an uncontrollable and overwhelming idea, that
it durst not confide in its own decisions.  I now see how fatally I
betrayed my quiet, by suffering chimeras to prey upon me in secret; but
melancholy shrinks from communication, and I never found a man before to
whom I could impart my troubles, though I had been certain of relief.  I
rejoice to find my own sentiments confirmed by yours, who are not easily
deceived, and can have no motive or purpose to deceive.  I hope that time
and variety will dissipate the gloom that has so long surrounded me, and
the latter part of my days will be spent in peace.”

“Your learning and virtue,” said Imlac, “may justly give you hopes.”

Rasselas then entered, with the Princess and Pekuah, and inquired whether
they had contrived any new diversion for the next day.  “Such,” said
Nekayah, “is the state of life, that none are happy but by the
anticipation of change; the change itself is nothing; when we have made
it the next wish is to change again.  The world is not yet exhausted: let
me see something to-morrow which I never saw before.”

“Variety,” said Rasselas, “is so necessary to content, that even the
Happy Valley disgusted me by the recurrence of its luxuries; yet I could
not forbear to reproach myself with impatience when I saw the monks of
St. Anthony support, without complaint, a life, not of uniform delight,
but uniform hardship.”

“Those men,” answered Imlac, “are less wretched in their silent convent
than the Abyssinian princes in their prison of pleasure.  Whatever is
done by the monks is incited by an adequate and reasonable motive.  Their
labour supplies them with necessaries; it therefore cannot be omitted,
and is certainly rewarded.  Their devotion prepares them for another
state, and reminds them of its approach while it fits them for it.  Their
time is regularly distributed; one duty succeeds another, so that they
are not left open to the distraction of unguided choice, nor lost in the
shades of listless inactivity.  There is a certain task to be performed
at an appropriated hour, and their toils are cheerful, because they
consider them as acts of piety by which they are always advancing towards
endless felicity.”

“Do you think,” said Nekayah, “that the monastic rule is a more holy and
less imperfect state than any other?  May not he equally hope for future
happiness who converses openly with mankind, who succours the distressed
by his charity, instructs the ignorant by his learning, and contributes
by his industry to the general system of life, even though he should omit
some of the mortifications which are practised in the cloister, and allow
himself such harmless delights as his condition may place within his
reach?”

“This,” said Imlac, “is a question which has long divided the wise and
perplexed the good.  I am afraid to decide on either part.  He that lives
well in the world is better than he that lives well in a monastery.  But
perhaps everyone is not able to stem the temptations of public life, and
if he cannot conquer he may properly retreat.  Some have little power to
do good, and have likewise little strength to resist evil.  Many are
weary of the conflicts with adversity, and are willing to eject those
passions which have long busied them in vain.  And many are dismissed by
age and diseases from the more laborious duties of society.  In
monasteries the weak and timorous may be happily sheltered, the weary may
repose, and the penitent may meditate.  Those retreats of prayer and
contemplation have something so congenial to the mind of man, that
perhaps there is scarcely one that does not purpose to close his life in
pious abstraction, with a few associates serious as himself.”

“Such,” said Pekuah, “has often been my wish, and I have heard the
Princess declare that she should not willingly die in a crowd.”

“The liberty of using harmless pleasures,” proceeded Imlac, “will not be
disputed, but it is still to be examined what pleasures are harmless.
The evil of any pleasure that Nekayah can image is not in the act itself
but in its consequences.  Pleasure in itself harmless may become
mischievous by endearing to us a state which we know to be transient and
probatory, and withdrawing our thoughts from that of which every hour
brings us nearer to the beginning, and of which no length of time will
bring us to the end.  Mortification is not virtuous in itself, nor has
any other use but that it disengages us from the allurements of sense.
In the state of future perfection to which we all aspire there will be
pleasure without danger and security without restraint.”

The Princess was silent, and Rasselas, turning to the astronomer, asked
him whether he could not delay her retreat by showing her something which
she had not seen before.

“Your curiosity,” said the sage, “has been so general, and your pursuit
of knowledge so vigorous, that novelties are not now very easily to be
found; but what you can no longer procure from the living may be given by
the dead.  Among the wonders of this country are the catacombs, or the
ancient repositories in which the bodies of the earliest generations were
lodged, and where, by the virtue of the gums which embalmed them, they
yet remain without corruption.”

“I know not,” said Rasselas, “what pleasure the sight of the catacombs
can afford; but, since nothing else is offered, I am resolved to view
them, and shall place this with my other things which I have done because
I would do something.”

They hired a guard of horsemen, and the next day visited the catacombs.
When they were about to descend into the sepulchral caves, “Pekuah,” said
the Princess, “we are now again invading the habitations of the dead; I
know that you will stay behind.  Let me find you safe when I return.”
“No, I will not be left,” answered Pekuah, “I will go down between you
and the Prince.”

They then all descended, and roved with wonder through the labyrinth of
subterraneous passages, where the bodies were laid in rows on either
side.




CHAPTER XLVIII
IMLAC DISCOURSES ON THE NATURE OF THE SOUL.


“WHAT reason,” said the Prince, “can be given why the Egyptians should
thus expensively preserve those carcases which some nations consume with
fire, others lay to mingle with the earth, and all agree to remove from
their sight as soon as decent rites can be performed?”

“The original of ancient customs,” said Imlac, “is commonly unknown, for
the practice often continues when the cause has ceased; and concerning
superstitious ceremonies it is vain to conjecture; for what reason did
not dictate, reason cannot explain.  I have long believed that the
practice of embalming arose only from tenderness to the remains of
relations or friends; and to this opinion I am more inclined because it
seems impossible that this care should have been general; had all the
dead been embalmed, their repositories must in time have been more
spacious than the dwellings of the living.  I suppose only the rich or
honourable were secured from corruption, and the rest left to the course
of nature.

“But it is commonly supposed that the Egyptians believed the soul to live
as long as the body continued undissolved, and therefore tried this
method of eluding death.”

“Could the wise Egyptians,” said Nekayah, “think so grossly of the soul?
If the soul could once survive its separation, what could it afterwards
receive or suffer from the body?”

“The Egyptians would doubtless think erroneously,” said the astronomer,
“in the darkness of heathenism and the first dawn of philosophy.  The
nature of the soul is still disputed amidst all our opportunities of
clearer knowledge; some yet say that it may be material, who,
nevertheless, believe it to be immortal.”

“Some,” answered Imlac, “have indeed said that the soul is material, but
I can scarcely believe that any man has thought it who knew how to think;
for all the conclusions of reason enforce the immateriality of mind, and
all the notices of sense and investigations of science concur to prove
the unconsciousness of matter.

“It was never supposed that cogitation is inherent in matter, or that
every particle is a thinking being.  Yet if any part of matter be devoid
of thought, what part can we suppose to think?  Matter can differ from
matter only in form, density, bulk, motion, and direction of motion.  To
which of these, however varied or combined, can consciousness be annexed?
To be round or square, to be solid or fluid, to be great or little, to be
moved slowly or swiftly, one way or another, are modes of material
existence all equally alien from the nature of cogitation.  If matter be
once without thought, it can only be made to think by some new
modification; but all the modifications which it can admit are equally
unconnected with cogitative powers.”

“But the materialists,” said the astronomer, “urge that matter may have
qualities with which we are unacquainted.”

“He who will determine,” returned Imlac, “against that which he knows
because there may be something which he knows not; he that can set
hypothetical possibility against acknowledged certainty, is not to be
admitted among reasonable beings.  All that we know of matter is, that
matter is inert, senseless, and lifeless; and if this conviction cannot
he opposed but by referring us to something that we know not, we have all
the evidence that human intellect can admit.  If that which is known may
be overruled by that which is unknown, no being, not omniscient, can
arrive at certainty.”

“Yet let us not,” said the astronomer, “too arrogantly limit the
Creator’s power.”

“It is no limitation of Omnipotence,” replied the poet, “to suppose that
one thing is not consistent with another, that the same proposition
cannot be at once true and false, that the same number cannot be even and
odd, that cogitation cannot be conferred on that which is created
incapable of cogitation.”

“I know not,” said Nekayah, “any great use of this question.  Does that
immateriality, which in my opinion you have sufficiently proved,
necessarily include eternal duration?”

“Of immateriality,” said Imlac, “our ideas are negative, and therefore
obscure.  Immateriality seems to imply a natural power of perpetual
duration as a consequence of exemption from all causes of decay: whatever
perishes is destroyed by the solution of its contexture and separation of
its parts; nor can we conceive how that which has no parts, and therefore
admits no solution, can be naturally corrupted or impaired.”

“I know not,” said Rasselas, “how to conceive anything without extension:
what is extended must have parts, and you allow that whatever has parts
may be destroyed.”

“Consider your own conceptions,” replied Imlac, “and the difficulty will
be less.  You will find substance without extension.  An ideal form is no
less real than material bulk; yet an ideal form has no extension.  It is
no less certain, when you think on a pyramid, that your mind possesses
the idea of a pyramid, than that the pyramid itself is standing.  What
space does the idea of a pyramid occupy more than the idea of a grain of
corn? or how can either idea suffer laceration?  As is the effect, such
is the cause; as thought, such is the power that thinks, a power
impassive and indiscerptible.”

“But the Being,” said Nekayah, “whom I fear to name, the Being which made
the soul, can destroy it.”

“He surely can destroy it,” answered Imlac, “since, however imperishable,
it receives from a superior nature its power of duration.  That it will
not perish by any inherent cause of decay or principle of corruption, may
be shown by philosophy; but philosophy can tell no more.  That it will
not be annihilated by Him that made it, we must humbly learn from higher
authority.”

The whole assembly stood awhile silent and collected.  “Let us return,”
said Rasselas, “from this scene of mortality.  How gloomy would be these
mansions of the dead to him who did not know that he should never die;
that what now acts shall continue its agency, and what now thinks shall
think on for ever.  Those that lie here stretched before us, the wise and
the powerful of ancient times, warn us to remember the shortness of our
present state; they were perhaps snatched away while they were busy, like
us, in the _choice of life_.”

“To me,” said the Princess, “the choice of life is become less important;
I hope hereafter to think only on the choice of eternity.”

They then hastened out of the caverns, and under the protection of their
guard returned to Cairo.




CHAPTER XLIX
THE CONCLUSION, IN WHICH NOTHING IS CONCLUDED.


IT was now the time of the inundation of the Nile.  A few days after
their visit to the catacombs the river began to rise.

They were confined to their house.  The whole region being under water,
gave them no invitation to any excursions; and being well supplied with
materials for talk, they diverted themselves with comparisons of the
different forms of life which they had observed, and with various schemes
of happiness which each of them had formed.

Pekuah was never so much charmed with any place as the Convent of St.
Anthony, where the Arab restored her to the Princess, and wished only to
fill it with pious maidens and to be made prioress of the order.  She was
weary of expectation and disgust, and would gladly be fixed in some
unvariable state.

The Princess thought that, of all sublunary things, knowledge was the
best.  She desired first to learn all sciences, and then proposed to
found a college of learned women, in which she would preside, that, by
conversing with the old and educating the young, she might divide her
time between the acquisition and communication of wisdom, and raise up
for the next age models of prudence and patterns of piety.

The Prince desired a little kingdom in which he might administer justice
in his own person and see all the parts of government with his own eyes;
but he could never fix the limits of his dominion, and was always adding
to the number of his subjects.

Imlac and the astronomer were contented to be driven along the stream of
life without directing their course to any particular port.

Of those wishes that they had formed they well knew that none could be
obtained.  They deliberated awhile what was to be done, and resolved,
when the inundation should cease, to return to Abyssinia.
must be that
country which, lying between the Emperor of Morocco’s dominions and the
negroes, lies waste and uninhabited, except by wild beasts; the negroes
having abandoned it and gone farther south for fear of the Moors, and the
Moors not thinking it worth inhabiting by reason of its barrenness; and
indeed, both forsaking it because of the prodigious number of tigers,
lions, leopards, and other furious creatures which harbour there; so that
the Moors use it for their hunting only, where they go like an army, two
or three thousand men at a time; and indeed for near a hundred miles
together upon this coast we saw nothing but a waste, uninhabited country
by day, and heard nothing but howlings and roaring of wild beasts by
night.

Once or twice in the daytime I thought I saw the Pico of Teneriffe, being
the high top of the Mountain Teneriffe in the Canaries, and had a great
mind to venture out, in hopes of reaching thither; but having tried
twice, I was forced in again by contrary winds, the sea also going too
high for my little vessel; so, I resolved to pursue my first design, and
keep along the shore.

Several times I was obliged to land for fresh water, after we had left
this place; and once in particular, being early in morning, we came to an
anchor under a little point of land, which was pretty high; and the tide
beginning to flow, we lay still to go farther in.  Xury, whose eyes were
more about him than it seems mine were, calls softly to me, and tells me
that we had best go farther off the shore; “For,” says he, “look, yonder
lies a dreadful monster on the side of that hillock, fast asleep.”  I
looked where he pointed, and saw a dreadful monster indeed, for it was a
terrible, great lion that lay on the side of the shore, under the shade
of a piece of the hill that hung as it were a little over him.  “Xury,”
says I, “you shall on shore and kill him.”  Xury, looked frighted, and
said, “Me kill! he eat me at one mouth!”—one mouthful he meant.  However,
I said no more to the boy, but bade him lie still, and I took our biggest
gun, which was almost musket-bore, and loaded it with a good charge of
powder, and with two slugs, and laid it down; then I loaded another gun
with two bullets; and the third (for we had three pieces) I loaded with
five smaller bullets.  I took the best aim I could with the first piece
to have shot him in the head, but he lay so with his leg raised a little
above his nose, that the slugs hit his leg about the knee and broke the
bone.  He started up, growling at first, but finding his leg broken, fell
down again; and then got upon three legs, and gave the most hideous roar
that ever I heard.  I was a little surprised that I had not hit him on
the head; however, I took up the second piece immediately, and though he
began to move off, fired again, and shot him in the head, and had the
pleasure to see him drop and make but little noise, but lie struggling
for life.  Then Xury took heart, and would have me let him go on shore.
“Well, go,” said I: so the boy jumped into the water and taking a little
gun in one hand, swam to shore with the other hand, and coming close to
the creature, put the muzzle of the piece to his ear, and shot him in the
head again, which despatched him quite.

This was game indeed to us, but this was no food; and I was very sorry to
lose three charges of powder and shot upon a creature that was good for
nothing to us.  However, Xury said he would have some of him; so he comes
on board, and asked me to give him the hatchet.  “For what, Xury?” said
I.  “Me cut off his head,” said he.  However, Xury could not cut off his
head, but he cut off a foot, and brought it with him, and it was a
monstrous great one.

I bethought myself, however, that, perhaps the skin of him might, one way
or other, be of some value to us; and I resolved to take off his skin if
I could.  So Xury and I went to work with him; but Xury was much the
better workman at it, for I knew very ill how to do it.  Indeed, it took
us both up the whole day, but at last we got off the hide of him, and
spreading it on the top of our cabin, the sun effectually dried it in two
days’ time, and it afterwards served me to lie upon.




CHAPTER III—WRECKED ON A DESERT ISLAND


After this stop, we made on to the southward continually for ten or
twelve days, living very sparingly on our provisions, which began to
abate very much, and going no oftener to the shore than we were obliged
to for fresh water.  My design in this was to make the river Gambia or
Senegal, that is to say anywhere about the Cape de Verde, where I was in
hopes to meet with some European ship; and if I did not, I knew not what
course I had to take, but to seek for the islands, or perish there among
the negroes.  I knew that all the ships from Europe, which sailed either
to the coast of Guinea or to Brazil, or to the East Indies, made this
cape, or those islands; and, in a word, I put the whole of my fortune
upon this single point, either that I must meet with some ship or must
perish.

When I had pursued this resolution about ten days longer, as I have said,
I began to see that the land was inhabited; and in two or three places,
as we sailed by, we saw people stand upon the shore to look at us; we
could also perceive they were quite black and naked.  I was once inclined
to have gone on shore to them; but Xury was my better counsellor, and
said to me, “No go, no go.”  However, I hauled in nearer the shore that I
might talk to them, and I found they ran along the shore by me a good
way.  I observed they had no weapons in their hand, except one, who had a
long slender stick, which Xury said was a lance, and that they could
throw them a great way with good aim; so I kept at a distance, but talked
with them by signs as well as I could; and particularly made signs for
something to eat: they beckoned to me to stop my boat, and they would
fetch me some meat.  Upon this I lowered the top of my sail and lay by,
and two of them ran up into the country, and in less than half-an-hour
came back, and brought with them two pieces of dried flesh and some corn,
such as is the produce of their country; but we neither knew what the one
or the other was; however, we were willing to accept it, but how to come
at it was our next dispute, for I would not venture on shore to them, and
they were as much afraid of us; but they took a safe way for us all, for
they brought it to the shore and laid it down, and went and stood a great
way off till we fetched it on board, and then came close to us again.

We made signs of thanks to them, for we had nothing to make them amends;
but an opportunity offered that very instant to oblige them wonderfully;
for while we were lying by the shore came two mighty creatures, one
pursuing the other (as we took it) with great fury from the mountains
towards the sea; whether it was the male pursuing the female, or whether
they were in sport or in rage, we could not tell, any more than we could
tell whether it was usual or strange, but I believe it was the latter;
because, in the first place, those ravenous creatures seldom appear but
in the night; and, in the second place, we found the people terribly
frighted, especially the women.  The man that had the lance or dart did
not fly from them, but the rest did; however, as the two creatures ran
directly into the water, they did not offer to fall upon any of the
negroes, but plunged themselves into the sea, and swam about, as if they
had come for their diversion; at last one of them began to come nearer
our boat than at first I expected; but I lay ready for him, for I had
loaded my gun with all possible expedition, and bade Xury load both the
others.  As soon as he came fairly within my reach, I fired, and shot him
directly in the head; immediately he sank down into the water, but rose
instantly, and plunged up and down, as if he were struggling for life,
and so indeed he was; he immediately made to the shore; but between the
wound, which was his mortal hurt, and the strangling of the water, he
died just before he reached the shore.

It is impossible to express the astonishment of these poor creatures at
the noise and fire of my gun: some of them were even ready to die for
fear, and fell down as dead with the very terror; but when they saw the
creature dead, and sunk in the water, and that I made signs to them to
come to the shore, they took heart and came, and began to search for the
creature.  I found him by his blood staining the water; and by the help
of a rope, which I slung round him, and gave the negroes to haul, they
dragged him on shore, and found that it was a most curious leopard,
spotted, and fine to an admirable degree; and the negroes held up their
hands with admiration, to think what it was I had killed him with.

The other creature, frighted with the flash of fire and the noise of the
gun, swam on shore, and ran up directly to the mountains from whence they
came; nor could I, at that distance, know what it was.  I found quickly
the negroes wished to eat the flesh of this creature, so I was willing to
have them take it as a favour from me; which, when I made signs to them
that they might take him, they were very thankful for.  Immediately they
fell to work with him; and though they had no knife, yet, with a
sharpened piece of wood, they took off his skin as readily, and much more
readily, than we could have done with a knife.  They offered me some of
the flesh, which I declined, pointing out that I would give it them; but
made signs for the skin, which they gave me very freely, and brought me a
great deal more of their provisions, which, though I did not understand,
yet I accepted.  I then made signs to them for some water, and held out
one of my jars to them, turning it bottom upward, to show that it was
empty, and that I wanted to have it filled.  They called immediately to
some of their friends, and there came two women, and brought a great
vessel made of earth, and burnt, as I supposed, in the sun, this they set
down to me, as before, and I sent Xury on shore with my jars, and filled
them all three.  The women were as naked as the men.

I was now furnished with roots and corn, such as it was, and water; and
leaving my friendly negroes, I made forward for about eleven days more,
without offering to go near the shore, till I saw the land run out a
great length into the sea, at about the distance of four or five leagues
before me; and the sea being very calm, I kept a large offing to make
this point.  At length, doubling the point, at about two leagues from the
land, I saw plainly land on the other side, to seaward; then I concluded,
as it was most certain indeed, that this was the Cape de Verde, and those
the islands called, from thence, Cape de Verde Islands.  However, they
were at a great distance, and I could not well tell what I had best to
do; for if I should be taken with a fresh of wind, I might neither reach
one or other.

In this dilemma, as I was very pensive, I stepped into the cabin and sat
down, Xury having the helm; when, on a sudden, the boy cried out,
“Master, master, a ship with a sail!” and the foolish boy was frighted
out of his wits, thinking it must needs be some of his master’s ships
sent to pursue us, but I knew we were far enough out of their reach.  I
jumped out of the cabin, and immediately saw, not only the ship, but that
it was a Portuguese ship; and, as I thought, was bound to the coast of
Guinea, for negroes.  But, when I observed the course she steered, I was
soon convinced they were bound some other way, and did not design to come
any nearer to the shore; upon which I stretched out to sea as much as I
could, resolving to speak with them if possible.

With all the sail I could make, I found I should not be able to come in
their way, but that they would be gone by before I could make any signal
to them: but after I had crowded to the utmost, and began to despair,
they, it seems, saw by the help of their glasses that it was some
European boat, which they supposed must belong to some ship that was
lost; so they shortened sail to let me come up.  I was encouraged with
this, and as I had my patron’s ancient on board, I made a waft of it to
them, for a signal of distress, and fired a gun, both which they saw; for
they told me they saw the smoke, though they did not hear the gun.  Upon
these signals they very kindly brought to, and lay by for me; and in
about three hours; time I came up with them.

They asked me what I was, in Portuguese, and in Spanish, and in French,
but I understood none of them; but at last a Scotch sailor, who was on
board, called to me: and I answered him, and told him I was an
Englishman, that I had made my escape out of slavery from the Moors, at
Sallee; they then bade me come on board, and very kindly took me in, and
all my goods.

It was an inexpressible joy to me, which any one will believe, that I was
thus delivered, as I esteemed it, from such a miserable and almost
hopeless condition as I was in; and I immediately offered all I had to
the captain of the ship, as a return for my deliverance; but he
generously told me he would take nothing from me, but that all I had
should be delivered safe to me when I came to the Brazils.  “For,” says
he, “I have saved your life on no other terms than I would be glad to be
saved myself: and it may, one time or other, be my lot to be taken up in
the same condition.  Besides,” said he, “when I carry you to the Brazils,
so great a way from your own country, if I should take from you what you
have, you will be starved there, and then I only take away that life I
have given.  No, no,” says he: “Seignior Inglese” (Mr. Englishman), “I
will carry you thither in charity, and those things will help to buy your
subsistence there, and your passage home again.”

As he was charitable in this proposal, so he was just in the performance
to a tittle; for he ordered the seamen that none should touch anything
that I had: then he took everything into his own possession, and gave me
back an exact inventory of them, that I might have them, even to my three
earthen jars.

As to my boat, it was a very good one; and that he saw, and told me he
would buy it of me for his ship’s use; and asked me what I would have for
it?  I told him he had been so generous to me in everything that I could
not offer to make any price of the boat, but left it entirely to him:
upon which he told me he would give me a note of hand to pay me eighty
pieces of eight for it at Brazil; and when it came there, if any one
offered to give more, he would make it up.  He offered me also sixty
pieces of eight more for my boy Xury, which I was loth to take; not that
I was unwilling to let the captain have him, but I was very loth to sell
the poor boy’s liberty, who had assisted me so faithfully in procuring my
own.  However, when I let him know my reason, he owned it to be just, and
offered me this medium, that he would give the boy an obligation to set
him free in ten years, if he turned Christian: upon this, and Xury saying
he was willing to go to him, I let the captain have him.

We had a very good voyage to the Brazils, and I arrived in the Bay de
Todos los Santos, or All Saints’ Bay, in about twenty-two days after.
And now I was once more delivered from the most miserable of all
conditions of life; and what to do next with myself I was to consider.

The generous treatment the captain gave me I can never enough remember:
he would take nothing of me for my passage, gave me twenty ducats for the
leopard’s skin, and forty for the lion’s skin, which I had in my boat,
and caused everything I had in the ship to be punctually delivered to me;
and what I was willing to sell he bought of me, such as the case of
bottles, two of my guns, and a piece of the lump of beeswax—for I had
made candles of the rest: in a word, I made about two hundred and twenty
pieces of eight of all my cargo; and with this stock I went on shore in
the Brazils.

I had not been long here before I was recommended to the house of a good
honest man like himself, who had an _ingenio_, as they call it (that is,
a plantation and a sugar-house).  I lived with him some time, and
acquainted myself by that means with the manner of planting and making of
sugar; and seeing how well the planters lived, and how they got rich
suddenly, I resolved, if I could get a licence to settle there, I would
turn planter among them: resolving in the meantime to find out some way
to get my money, which I had left in London, remitted to me.  To this
purpose, getting a kind of letter of naturalisation, I purchased as much
land that was uncured as my money would reach, and formed a plan for my
plantation and settlement; such a one as might be suitable to the stock
which I proposed to myself to receive from England.

I had a neighbour, a Portuguese, of Lisbon, but born of English parents,
whose name was Wells, and in much such circumstances as I was.  I call
him my neighbour, because his plantation lay next to mine, and we went on
very sociably together.  My stock was but low, as well as his; and we
rather planted for food than anything else, for about two years.
However, we began to increase, and our land began to come into order; so
that the third year we planted some tobacco, and made each of us a large
piece of ground ready for planting canes in the year to come.  But we
both wanted help; and now I found, more than before, I had done wrong in
parting with my boy Xury.

But, alas! for me to do wrong that never did right, was no great wonder.
I hail no remedy but to go on: I had got into an employment quite remote
to my genius, and directly contrary to the life I delighted in, and for
which I forsook my father’s house, and broke through all his good advice.
Nay, I was coming into the very middle station, or upper degree of low
life, which my father advised me to before, and which, if I resolved to
go on with, I might as well have stayed at home, and never have fatigued
myself in the world as I had done; and I used often to say to myself, I
could have done this as well in England, among my friends, as have gone
five thousand miles off to do it among strangers and savages, in a
wilderness, and at such a distance as never to hear from any part of the
world that had the least knowledge of me.

In this manner I used to look upon my condition with the utmost regret.
I had nobody to converse with, but now and then this neighbour; no work
to be done, but by the labour of my hands; and I used to say, I lived
just like a man cast away upon some desolate island, that had nobody
there but himself.  But how just has it been—and how should all men
reflect, that when they compare their present conditions with others that
are worse, Heaven may oblige them to make the exchange, and be convinced
of their former felicity by their experience—I say, how just has it been,
that the truly solitary life I reflected on, in an island of mere
desolation, should be my lot, who had so often unjustly compared it with
the life which I then led, in which, had I continued, I had in all
probability been exceeding prosperous and rich.

I was in some degree settled in my measures for carrying on the
plantation before my kind friend, the captain of the ship that took me up
at sea, went back—for the ship remained there, in providing his lading
and preparing for his voyage, nearly three months—when telling him what
little stock I had left behind me in London, he gave me this friendly and
sincere advice:—“Seignior Inglese,” says he (for so he always called me),
“if you will give me letters, and a procuration in form to me, with
orders to the person who has your money in London to send your effects to
Lisbon, to such persons as I shall direct, and in such goods as are
proper for this country, I will bring you the produce of them, God
willing, at my return; but, since human affairs are all subject to
changes and disasters, I would have you give orders but for one hundred
pounds sterling, which, you say, is half your stock, and let the hazard
be run for the first; so that, if it come safe, you may order the rest
the same way, and, if it miscarry, you may have the other half to have
recourse to for your supply.”

This was so wholesome advice, and looked so friendly, that I could not
but be convinced it was the best course I could take; so I accordingly
prepared letters to the gentlewoman with whom I had left my money, and a
procuration to the Portuguese captain, as he desired.

I wrote the English captain’s widow a full account of all my
adventures—my slavery, escape, and how I had met with the Portuguese
captain at sea, the humanity of his behaviour, and what condition I was
now in, with all other necessary directions for my supply; and when this
honest captain came to Lisbon, he found means, by some of the English
merchants there, to send over, not the order only, but a full account of
my story to a merchant in London, who represented it effectually to her;
whereupon she not only delivered the money, but out of her own pocket
sent the Portugal captain a very handsome present for his humanity and
charity to me.

The merchant in London, vesting this hundred pounds in English goods,
such as the captain had written for, sent them directly to him at Lisbon,
and he brought them all safe to me to the Brazils; among which, without
my direction (for I was too young in my business to think of them), he
had taken care to have all sorts of tools, ironwork, and utensils
necessary for my plantation, and which were of great use to me.

When this cargo arrived I thought my fortune made, for I was surprised
with the joy of it; and my stood steward, the captain, had laid out the
five pounds, which my friend had sent him for a present for himself, to
purchase and bring me over a servant, under bond for six years’ service,
and would not accept of any consideration, except a little tobacco, which
I would have him accept, being of my own produce.

Neither was this all; for my goods being all English manufacture, such as
cloths, stuffs, baize, and things particularly valuable and desirable in
the country, I found means to sell them to a very great advantage; so
that I might say I had more than four times the value of my first cargo,
and was now infinitely beyond my poor neighbour—I mean in the advancement
of my plantation; for the first thing I did, I bought me a negro slave,
and an European servant also—I mean another besides that which the
captain brought me from Lisbon.

But as abused prosperity is oftentimes made the very means of our
greatest adversity, so it was with me.  I went on the next year with
great success in my plantation: I raised fifty great rolls of tobacco on
my own ground, more than I had disposed of for necessaries among my
neighbours; and these fifty rolls, being each of above a hundredweight,
were well cured, and laid by against the return of the fleet from Lisbon:
and now increasing in business and wealth, my head began to be full of
projects and undertakings beyond my reach; such as are, indeed, often the
ruin of the best heads in business.  Had I continued in the station I was
now in, I had room for all the happy things to have yet befallen me for
which my father so earnestly recommended a quiet, retired life, and of
which he had so sensibly described the middle station of life to be full
of; but other things attended me, and I was still to be the wilful agent
of all my own miseries; and particularly, to increase my fault, and
double the reflections upon myself, which in my future sorrows I should
have leisure to make, all these miscarriages were procured by my apparent
obstinate adhering to my foolish inclination of wandering abroad, and
pursuing that inclination, in contradiction to the clearest views of
doing myself good in a fair and plain pursuit of those prospects, and
those measures of life, which nature and Providence concurred to present
me with, and to make my duty.

As I had once done thus in my breaking away from my parents, so I could
not be content now, but I must go and leave the happy view I had of being
a rich and thriving man in my new plantation, only to pursue a rash and
immoderate desire of rising faster than the nature of the thing admitted;
and thus I cast myself down again into the deepest gulf of human misery
that ever man fell into, or perhaps could be consistent with life and a
state of health in the world.

To come, then, by the just degrees to the particulars of this part of my
story.  You may suppose, that having now lived almost four years in the
Brazils, and beginning to thrive and prosper very well upon my
plantation, I had not only learned the language, but had contracted
acquaintance and friendship among my fellow-planters, as well as among
the merchants at St. Salvador, which was our port; and that, in my
discourses among them, I had frequently given them an account of my two
voyages to the coast of Guinea: the manner of trading with the negroes
there, and how easy it was to purchase upon the coast for trifles—such as
beads, toys, knives, scissors, hatchets, bits of glass, and the like—not
only gold-dust, Guinea grains, elephants’ teeth, &c., but negroes, for
the service of the Brazils, in great numbers.

They listened always very attentively to my discourses on these heads,
but especially to that part which related to the buying of negroes, which
was a trade at that time, not only not far entered into, but, as far as
it was, had been carried on by assientos, or permission of the kings of
Spain and Portugal, and engrossed in the public stock: so that few
negroes were bought, and these excessively dear.

It happened, being in company with some merchants and planters of my
acquaintance, and talking of those things very earnestly, three of them
came to me next morning, and told me they had been musing very much upon
what I had discoursed with them of the last night, and they came to make
a secret proposal to me; and, after enjoining me to secrecy, they told me
that they had a mind to fit out a ship to go to Guinea; that they had all
plantations as well as I, and were straitened for nothing so much as
servants; that as it was a trade that could not be carried on, because
they could not publicly sell the negroes when they came home, so they
desired to make but one voyage, to bring the negroes on shore privately,
and divide them among their own plantations; and, in a word, the question
was whether I would go their supercargo in the ship, to manage the
trading part upon the coast of Guinea; and they offered me that I should
have my equal share of the negroes, without providing any part of the
stock.

This was a fair proposal, it must be confessed, had it been made to any
one that had not had a settlement and a plantation of his own to look
after, which was in a fair way of coming to be very considerable, and
with a good stock upon it; but for me, that was thus entered and
established, and had nothing to do but to go on as I had begun, for three
or four years more, and to have sent for the other hundred pounds from
England; and who in that time, and with that little addition, could
scarce have failed of being worth three or four thousand pounds sterling,
and that increasing too—for me to think of such a voyage was the most
preposterous thing that ever man in such circumstances could be guilty
of.

But I, that was born to be my own destroyer, could no more resist the
offer than I could restrain my first rambling designs when my father’
good counsel was lost upon me.  In a word, I told them I would go with
all my heart, if they would undertake to look after my plantation in my
absence, and would dispose of it to such as I should direct, if I
miscarried.  This they all engaged to do, and entered into writings or
covenants to do so; and I made a formal will, disposing of my plantation
and effects in case of my death, making the captain of the ship that had
saved my life, as before, my universal heir, but obliging him to dispose
of my effects as I had directed in my will; one half of the produce being
to himself, and the other to be shipped to England.

In short, I took all possible caution to preserve my effects and to keep
up my plantation.  Had I used half as much prudence to have looked into
my own interest, and have made a judgment of what I ought to have done
and not to have done, I had certainly never gone away from so prosperous
an undertaking, leaving all the probable views of a thriving
circumstance, and gone upon a voyage to sea, attended with all its common
hazards, to say nothing of the reasons I had to expect particular
misfortunes to myself.

But I was hurried on, and obeyed blindly the dictates of my fancy rather
than my reason; and, accordingly, the ship being fitted out, and the
cargo furnished, and all things done, as by agreement, by my partners in
the voyage, I went on board in an evil hour, the 1st September 1659,
being the same day eight years that I went from my father and mother at
Hull, in order to act the rebel to their authority, and the fool to my
own interests.

Our ship was about one hundred and twenty tons burden, carried six guns
and fourteen men, besides the master, his boy, and myself.  We had on
board no large cargo of goods, except of such toys as were fit for our
trade with the negroes, such as beads, bits of glass, shells, and other
trifles, especially little looking-glasses, knives, scissors, hatchets,
and the like.

The same day I went on board we set sail, standing away to the northward
upon our own coast, with design to stretch over for the African coast
when we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it
seems, was the manner of course in those days.  We had very good weather,
only excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came to the
height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we
lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando
de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the
east.  In this course we passed the line in about twelve days’ time, and
were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes
northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite
out of our knowledge.  It began from the south-east, came about to the
north-west, and then settled in the north-east; from whence it blew in
such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing
but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither fate and
the fury of the winds directed; and, during these twelve days, I need not
say that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in
the ship expect to save their lives.

In this distress we had, besides the terror of the storm, one of our men
die of the calenture, and one man and the boy washed overboard.  About
the twelfth day, the weather abating a little, the master made an
observation as well as he could, and found that he was in about eleven
degrees north latitude, but that he was twenty-two degrees of longitude
difference west from Cape St. Augustino; so that he found he was upon the
coast of Guiana, or the north part of Brazil, beyond the river Amazon,
toward that of the river Orinoco, commonly called the Great River; and
began to consult with me what course he should take, for the ship was
leaky, and very much disabled, and he was going directly back to the
coast of Brazil.

I was positively against that; and looking over the charts of the
sea-coast of America with him, we concluded there was no inhabited
country for us to have recourse to till we came within the circle of the
Caribbee Islands, and therefore resolved to stand away for Barbadoes;
which, by keeping off at sea, to avoid the indraft of the Bay or Gulf of
Mexico, we might easily perform, as we hoped, in about fifteen days’
sail; whereas we could not possibly make our voyage to the coast of
Africa without some assistance both to our ship and to ourselves.

With this design we changed our course, and steered away N.W. by W., in
order to reach some of our English islands, where I hoped for relief.
But our voyage was otherwise determined; for, being in the latitude of
twelve degrees eighteen minutes, a second storm came upon us, which
carried us away with the same impetuosity westward, and drove us so out
of the way of all human commerce, that, had all our lives been saved as
to the sea, we were rather in danger of being devoured by savages than
ever returning to our own country.

In this distress, the wind still blowing very hard, one of our men early
in the morning cried out, “Land!” and we had no sooner run out of the
cabin to look out, in hopes of seeing whereabouts in the world we were,
than the ship struck upon a sand, and in a moment her motion being so
stopped, the sea broke over her in such a manner that we expected we
should all have perished immediately; and we were immediately driven into
our close quarters, to shelter us from the very foam and spray of the
sea.

It is not easy for any one who has not been in the like condition to
describe or conceive the consternation of men in such circumstances.  We
knew nothing where we were, or upon what land it was we were
driven—whether an island or the main, whether inhabited or not inhabited.
As the rage of the wind was still great, though rather less than at
first, we could not so much as hope to have the ship hold many minutes
without breaking into pieces, unless the winds, by a kind of miracle,
should turn immediately about.  In a word, we sat looking upon one
another, and expecting death every moment, and every man, accordingly,
preparing for another world; for there was little or nothing more for us
to do in this.  That which was our present comfort, and all the comfort
we had, was that, contrary to our expectation, the ship did not break
yet, and that the master said the wind began to abate.

Now, though we thought that the wind did a little abate, yet the ship
having thus struck upon the sand, and sticking too fast for us to expect
her getting off, we were in a dreadful condition indeed, and had nothing
to do but to think of saving our lives as well as we could.  We had a
boat at our stern just before the storm, but she was first staved by
dashing against the ship’s rudder, and in the next place she broke away,
and either sunk or was driven off to sea; so there was no hope from her.
We had another boat on board, but how to get her off into the sea was a
doubtful thing.  However, there was no time to debate, for we fancied
that the ship would break in pieces every minute, and some told us she
was actually broken already.

In this distress the mate of our vessel laid hold of the boat, and with
the help of the rest of the men got her slung over the ship’s side; and
getting all into her, let go, and committed ourselves, being eleven in
number, to God’s mercy and the wild sea; for though the storm was abated
considerably, yet the sea ran dreadfully high upon the shore, and might
be well called _den wild zee_, as the Dutch call the sea in a storm.

And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that the
sea went so high that the boat could not live, and that we should be
inevitably drowned.  As to making sail, we had none, nor if we had could
we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew
that when the boat came near the shore she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the breach of the sea.  However, we committed our souls to God
in the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could
towards land.

What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew
not.  The only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation was, if we might find some bay or gulf, or the mouth of some
river, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got under
the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water.  But there was
nothing like this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore,
the land looked more frightful than the sea.

After we had rowed, or rather driven about a league and a half, as we
reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and
plainly bade us expect the _coup de grâce_.  It took us with such a fury,
that it overset the boat at once; and separating us as well from the boat
as from one another, gave us no time to say, “O God!” for we were all
swallowed up in a moment.

Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt when I sank
into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven
me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having
spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in.  I had so much presence of mind, as well
as breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I
got upon my feet, and endeavoured to make on towards the land as fast as
I could before another wave should return and take me up again; but I
soon found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me
as high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means
or strength to contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise
myself upon the water if I could; and so, by swimming, to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore, if possible, my greatest
concern now being that the sea, as it would carry me a great way towards
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it
gave back towards the sea.

The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty feet
deep in its own body, and I could feel myself carried with a mighty force
and swiftness towards the shore—a very great way; but I held my breath,
and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might.  I was ready
to burst with holding my breath, when, as I felt myself rising up, so, to
my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the
surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I
could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath, and new
courage.  I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long
but I held it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet.  I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and
till the waters went from me, and then took to my heels and ran with what
strength I had further towards the shore.  But neither would this deliver
me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again; and
twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forward as before,
the shore being very flat.

The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me, for the sea
having hurried me along as before, landed me, or rather dashed me,
against a piece of rock, and that with such force, that it left me
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow
taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my
body; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled
in the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves,
and seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold
fast by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till
the wave went back.  Now, as the waves were not so high as at first,
being nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched
another run, which brought me so near the shore that the next wave,
though it went over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away;
and the next run I took, I got to the mainland, where, to my great
comfort, I clambered up the cliffs of the shore and sat me down upon the
grass, free from danger and quite out of the reach of the water.

I was now landed and safe on shore, and began to look up and thank God
that my life was saved, in a case wherein there was some minutes before
scarce any room to hope.  I believe it is impossible to express, to the
life, what the ecstasies and transports of the soul are, when it is so
saved, as I may say, out of the very grave: and I do not wonder now at
the custom, when a malefactor, who has the halter about his neck, is tied
up, and just going to be turned off, and has a reprieve brought to him—I
say, I do not wonder that they bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood
that very moment they tell him of it, that the surprise may not drive the
animal spirits from the heart and overwhelm him.

    “For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first.”

I walked about on the shore lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I
may say, wrapped up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a
thousand gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon
all my comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul
saved but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any
sign of them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that
were not fellows.

I cast my eye to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the
sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far of; and
considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?

After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I
began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was
next to be done; and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,
I had a dreadful deliverance; for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nor anything either to eat or drink to comfort me; neither did I see any
prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger or being devoured by
wild beasts; and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I
had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or
to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me
for theirs.  In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a
tobacco-pipe, and a little tobacco in a box.  This was all my provisions;
and this threw me into such terrible agonies of mind, that for a while I
ran about like a madman.  Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy
heart to consider what would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts
in that country, as at night they always come abroad for their prey.

All the remedy that offered to my thoughts at that time was to get up
into a thick bushy tree like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I
should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life.  I walked about a
furlong from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink,
which I did, to my great joy; and having drank, and put a little tobacco
into my mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into
it, endeavoured to place myself so that if I should sleep I might not
fall.  And having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defence,
I took up my lodging; and having been excessively fatigued, I fell fast
asleep, and slept as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my
condition, and found myself more refreshed with it than, I think, I ever
was on such an occasion.




CHAPTER IV—FIRST WEEKS ON THE ISLAND


When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated,
so that the sea did not rage and swell as before.  But that which
surprised me most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the
sand where she lay by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost
as far as the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so
bruised by the wave dashing me against it.  This being within about a
mile from the shore where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright
still, I wished myself on board, that at least I might save some
necessary things for my use.

When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me again,
and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and the
sea had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand.
I walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a
neck or inlet of water between me and the boat which was about half a
mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon
getting at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present
subsistence.

A little after noon I found the sea very calm, and the tide ebbed so far
out that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship.  And here I
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we had
kept on board we had been all safe—that is to say, we had all got safe on
shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirety destitute
of all comfort and company as I now was.  This forced tears to my eyes
again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible,
to get to the ship; so I pulled off my clothes—for the weather was hot to
extremity—and took the water.  But when I came to the ship my difficulty
was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of.  I swam round her twice, and the second time I spied a small piece of
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hung down by the
fore-chains so low, as that with great difficulty I got hold of it, and
by the help of that rope I got up into the forecastle of the ship.  Here
I found that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her
hold, but that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or, rather
earth, that her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low,
almost to the water.  By this means all her quarter was free, and all
that was in that part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to
search, and to see what was spoiled and what was free.  And, first, I
found that all the ship’s provisions were dry and untouched by the water,
and being very well disposed to eat, I went to the bread room and filled
my pockets with biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I
had no time to lose.  I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which
I took a large dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me
for what was before me.  Now I wanted nothing but a boat to furnish
myself with many things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.

It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this
extremity roused my application.  We had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship; I
resolved to fall to work with these, and I flung as many of them
overboard as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a
rope, that they might not drive away.  When this was done I went down the
ship’s side, and pulling them to me, I tied four of them together at both
ends as well as I could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three
short pieces of plank upon them crossways, I found I could walk upon it
very well, but that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces
being too light.  So I went to work, and with a carpenter’s saw I cut a
spare topmast into three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great
deal of labour and pains.  But the hope of furnishing myself with
necessaries encouraged me to go beyond what I should have been able to
have done upon another occasion.

My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight.  My next
care was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it
from the surf of the sea; but I was not long considering this.  I first
laid all the planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having
considered well what I most wanted, I got three of the seamen’s chests,
which I had broken open, and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft;
the first of these I filled with provisions—viz. bread, rice, three Dutch
cheeses, five pieces of dried goat’s flesh (which we lived much upon),
and a little remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some
fowls which we brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed.  There
had been some barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappointment,
I found afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all.  As for
liquors, I found several, cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in
which were some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of
rack.  These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into
the chest, nor any room for them.  While I was doing this, I found the
tide begin to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see
my coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on the shore, upon the
sand, swim away.  As for my breeches, which were only linen, and
open-kneed, I swam on board in them and my stockings.  However, this set
me on rummaging for clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more
than I wanted for present use, for I had others things which my eye was
more upon—as, first, tools to work with on shore.  And it was after long
searching that I found out the carpenter’s chest, which was, indeed, a
very useful prize to me, and much more valuable than a shipload of gold
would have been at that time.  I got it down to my raft, whole as it was,
without losing time to look into it, for I knew in general what it
contained.

My next care was for some ammunition and arms.  There were two very good
fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols.  These I  in principle nor in policy, one way or other, to concern myself
in this affair: that my business was, by all possible means to conceal
myself from them, and not to leave the least sign for them to guess by
that there were any living creatures upon the island—I mean of human
shape.  Religion joined in with this prudential resolution; and I was
convinced now, many ways, that I was perfectly out of my duty when I was
laying all my bloody schemes for the destruction of innocent creatures—I
mean innocent as to me.  As to the crimes they were guilty of towards one
another, I had nothing to do with them; they were national, and I ought
to leave them to the justice of God, who is the Governor of nations, and
knows how, by national punishments, to make a just retribution for
national offences, and to bring public judgments upon those who offend in
a public manner, by such ways as best please Him.  This appeared so clear
to me now, that nothing was a greater satisfaction to me than that I had
not been suffered to do a thing which I now saw so much reason to believe
would have been no less a sin than that of wilful murder if I had
committed it; and I gave most humble thanks on my knees to God, that He
had thus delivered me from blood-guiltiness; beseeching Him to grant me
the protection of His providence, that I might not fall into the hands of
the barbarians, or that I might not lay my hands upon them, unless I had
a more clear call from Heaven to do it, in defence of my own life.

In this disposition I continued for near a year after this; and so far
was I from desiring an occasion for falling upon these wretches, that in
all that time I never once went up the hill to see whether there were any
of them in sight, or to know whether any of them had been on shore there
or not, that I might not be tempted to renew any of my contrivances
against them, or be provoked by any advantage that might present itself
to fall upon them; only this I did: I went and removed my boat, which I
had on the other side of the island, and carried it down to the east end
of the whole island, where I ran it into a little cove, which I found
under some high rocks, and where I knew, by reason of the currents, the
savages durst not, at least would not, come with their boats upon any
account whatever.  With my boat I carried away everything that I had left
there belonging to her, though not necessary for the bare going
thither—viz. a mast and sail which I had made for her, and a thing like
an anchor, but which, indeed, could not be called either anchor or
grapnel; however, it was the best I could make of its kind: all these I
removed, that there might not be the least shadow for discovery, or
appearance of any boat, or of any human habitation upon the island.
Besides this, I kept myself, as I said, more retired than ever, and
seldom went from my cell except upon my constant employment, to milk my
she-goats, and manage my little flock in the wood, which, as it was quite
on the other part of the island, was out of danger; for certain, it is
that these savage people, who sometimes haunted this island, never came
with any thoughts of finding anything here, and consequently never
wandered off from the coast, and I doubt not but they might have been
several times on shore after my apprehensions of them had made me
cautious, as well as before.  Indeed, I looked back with some horror upon
the thoughts of what my condition would have been if I had chopped upon
them and been discovered before that; when, naked and unarmed, except
with one gun, and that loaded often only with small shot, I walked
everywhere, peeping and peering about the island, to see what I could
get; what a surprise should I have been in if, when I discovered the
print of a man’s foot, I had, instead of that, seen fifteen or twenty
savages, and found them pursuing me, and by the swiftness of their
running no possibility of my escaping them!  The thoughts of this
sometimes sank my very soul within me, and distressed my mind so much
that I could not soon recover it, to think what I should have done, and
how I should not only have been unable to resist them, but even should
not have had presence of mind enough to do what I might have done; much
less what now, after so much consideration and preparation, I might be
able to do.  Indeed, after serious thinking of these things, I would be
melancholy, and sometimes it would last a great while; but I resolved it
all at last into thankfulness to that Providence which had delivered me
from so many unseen dangers, and had kept me from those mischiefs which I
could have no way been the agent in delivering myself from, because I had
not the least notion of any such thing depending, or the least
supposition of its being possible.  This renewed a contemplation which
often had come into my thoughts in former times, when first I began to
see the merciful dispositions of Heaven, in the dangers we run through in
this life; how wonderfully we are delivered when we know nothing of it;
how, when we are in a quandary as we call it, a doubt or hesitation
whether to go this way or that way, a secret hint shall direct us this
way, when we intended to go that way: nay, when sense, our own
inclination, and perhaps business has called us to go the other way, yet
a strange impression upon the mind, from we know not what springs, and by
we know not what power, shall overrule us to go this way; and it shall
afterwards appear that had we gone that way, which we should have gone,
and even to our imagination ought to have gone, we should have been
ruined and lost.  Upon these and many like reflections I afterwards made
it a certain rule with me, that whenever I found those secret hints or
pressings of mind to doing or not doing anything that presented, or going
this way or that way, I never failed to obey the secret dictate; though I
knew no other reason for it than such a pressure or such a hint hung upon
my mind.  I could give many examples of the success of this conduct in
the course of my life, but more especially in the latter part of my
inhabiting this unhappy island; besides many occasions which it is very
likely I might have taken notice of, if I had seen with the same eyes
then that I see with now.  But it is never too late to be wise; and I
cannot but advise all considering men, whose lives are attended with such
extraordinary incidents as mine, or even though not so extraordinary, not
to slight such secret intimations of Providence, let them come from what
invisible intelligence they will.  That I shall not discuss, and perhaps
cannot account for; but certainly they are a proof of the converse of
spirits, and a secret communication between those embodied and those
unembodied, and such a proof as can never be withstood; of which I shall
have occasion to give some remarkable instances in the remainder of my
solitary residence in this dismal place.

I believe the reader of this will not think it strange if I confess that
these anxieties, these constant dangers I lived in, and the concern that
was now upon me, put an end to all invention, and to all the contrivances
that I had laid for my future accommodations and conveniences.  I had the
care of my safety more now upon my hands than that of my food.  I cared
not to drive a nail, or chop a stick of wood now, for fear the noise I
might make should be heard: much less would I fire a gun for the same
reason: and above all I was intolerably uneasy at making any fire, lest
the smoke, which is visible at a great distance in the day, should betray
me.  For this reason, I removed that part of my business which required
fire, such as burning of pots and pipes, &c., into my new apartment in
the woods; where, after I had been some time, I found, to my unspeakable
consolation, a mere natural cave in the earth, which went in a vast way,
and where, I daresay, no savage, had he been at the mouth of it, would be
so hardy as to venture in; nor, indeed, would any man else, but one who,
like me, wanted nothing so much as a safe retreat.

The mouth of this hollow was at the bottom of a great rock, where, by
mere accident (I would say, if I did not see abundant reason to ascribe
all such things now to Providence), I was cutting down some thick
branches of trees to make charcoal; and before I go on I must observe the
reason of my making this charcoal, which was this—I was afraid of making
a smoke about my habitation, as I said before; and yet I could not live
there without baking my bread, cooking my meat, &c.; so I contrived to
burn some wood here, as I had seen done in England, under turf, till it
became chark or dry coal: and then putting the fire out, I preserved the
coal to carry home, and perform the other services for which fire was
wanting, without danger of smoke.  But this is by-the-bye.  While I was
cutting down some wood here, I perceived that, behind a very thick branch
of low brushwood or underwood, there was a kind of hollow place: I was
curious to look in it; and getting with difficulty into the mouth of it,
I found it was pretty large, that is to say, sufficient for me to stand
upright in it, and perhaps another with me: but I must confess to you
that I made more haste out than I did in, when looking farther into the
place, and which was perfectly dark, I saw two broad shining eyes of some
creature, whether devil or man I knew not, which twinkled like two stars;
the dim light from the cave’s mouth shining directly in, and making the
reflection.  However, after some pause I recovered myself, and began to
call myself a thousand fools, and to think that he that was afraid to see
the devil was not fit to live twenty years in an island all alone; and
that I might well think there was nothing in this cave that was more
frightful than myself.  Upon this, plucking up my courage, I took up a
firebrand, and in I rushed again, with the stick flaming in my hand: I
had not gone three steps in before I was almost as frightened as before;
for I heard a very loud sigh, like that of a man in some pain, and it was
followed by a broken noise, as of words half expressed, and then a deep
sigh again.  I stepped back, and was indeed struck with such a surprise
that it put me into a cold sweat, and if I had had a hat on my head, I
will not answer for it that my hair might not have lifted it off.  But
still plucking up my spirits as well as I could, and encouraging myself a
little with considering that the power and presence of God was
everywhere, and was able to protect me, I stepped forward again, and by
the light of the firebrand, holding it up a little over my head, I saw
lying on the ground a monstrous, frightful old he-goat, just making his
will, as we say, and gasping for life, and, dying, indeed, of mere old
age.  I stirred him a little to see if I could get him out, and he
essayed to get up, but was not able to raise himself; and I thought with
myself he might even lie there—for if he had frightened me, so he would
certainly fright any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as
to come in there while he had any life in him.

I was now recovered from my surprise, and began to look round me, when I
found the cave was but very small—that is to say, it might be about
twelve feet over, but in no manner of shape, neither round nor square, no
hands having ever been employed in making it but those of mere Nature.  I
observed also that there was a place at the farther side of it that went
in further, but was so low that it required me to creep upon my hands and
knees to go into it, and whither it went I knew not; so, having no
candle, I gave it over for that time, but resolved to go again the next
day provided with candles and a tinder-box, which I had made of the lock
of one of the muskets, with some wildfire in the pan.

Accordingly, the next day I came provided with six large candles of my
own making (for I made very good candles now of goat’s tallow, but was
hard set for candle-wick, using sometimes rags or rope-yarn, and
sometimes the dried rind of a weed like nettles); and going into this low
place I was obliged to creep upon all-fours as I have said, almost ten
yards—which, by the way, I thought was a venture bold enough, considering
that I knew not how far it might go, nor what was beyond it.  When I had
got through the strait, I found the roof rose higher up, I believe near
twenty feet; but never was such a glorious sight seen in the island, I
daresay, as it was to look round the sides and roof of this vault or
cave—the wall reflected a hundred thousand lights to me from my two
candles.  What it was in the rock—whether diamonds or any other precious
stones, or gold which I rather supposed it to be—I knew not.  The place I
was in was a most delightful cavity, or grotto, though perfectly dark;
the floor was dry and level, and had a sort of a small loose gravel upon
it, so that there was no nauseous or venomous creature to be seen,
neither was there any damp or wet on the sides or roof.  The only
difficulty in it was the entrance—which, however, as it was a place of
security, and such a retreat as I wanted; I thought was a convenience; so
that I was really rejoiced at the discovery, and resolved, without any
delay, to bring some of those things which I was most anxious about to
this place: particularly, I resolved to bring hither my magazine of
powder, and all my spare arms—viz. two fowling-pieces—for I had three in
all—and three muskets—for of them I had eight in all; so I kept in my
castle only five, which stood ready mounted like pieces of cannon on my
outmost fence, and were ready also to take out upon any expedition.  Upon
this occasion of removing my ammunition I happened to open the barrel of
powder which I took up out of the sea, and which had been wet, and I
found that the water had penetrated about three or four inches into the
powder on every side, which caking and growing hard, had preserved the
inside like a kernel in the shell, so that I had near sixty pounds of
very good powder in the centre of the cask.  This was a very agreeable
discovery to me at that time; so I carried all away thither, never
keeping above two or three pounds of powder with me in my castle, for
fear of a surprise of any kind; I also carried thither all the lead I had
left for bullets.

I fancied myself now like one of the ancient giants who were said to live
in caves and holes in the rocks, where none could come at them; for I
persuaded myself, while I was here, that if five hundred savages were to
hunt me, they could never find me out—or if they did, they would not
venture to attack me here.  The old goat whom I found expiring died in
the mouth of the cave the next day after I made this discovery; and I
found it much easier to dig a great hole there, and throw him in and
cover him with earth, than to drag him out; so I interred him there, to
prevent offence to my nose.




CHAPTER XIII—WRECK OF A SPANISH SHIP


I was now in the twenty-third year of my residence in this island, and
was so naturalised to the place and the manner of living, that, could I
but have enjoyed the certainty that no savages would come to the place to
disturb me, I could have been content to have capitulated for spending
the rest of my time there, even to the last moment, till I had laid me
down and died, like the old goat in the cave.  I had also arrived to some
little diversions and amusements, which made the time pass a great deal
more pleasantly with me than it did before—first, I had taught my Poll,
as I noted before, to speak; and he did it so familiarly, and talked so
articulately and plain, that it was very pleasant to me; and he lived
with me no less than six-and-twenty years.  How long he might have lived
afterwards I know not, though I know they have a notion in the Brazils
that they live a hundred years.  My dog was a pleasant and loving
companion to me for no less than sixteen years of my time, and then died
of mere old age.  As for my cats, they multiplied, as I have observed, to
that degree that I was obliged to shoot several of them at first, to keep
them from devouring me and all I had; but at length, when the two old
ones I brought with me were gone, and after some time continually driving
them from me, and letting them have no provision with me, they all ran
wild into the woods, except two or three favourites, which I kept tame,
and whose young, when they had any, I always drowned; and these were part
of my family.  Besides these I always kept two or three household kids
about me, whom I taught to feed out of my hand; and I had two more
parrots, which talked pretty well, and would all call “Robin Crusoe,” but
none like my first; nor, indeed, did I take the pains with any of them
that I had done with him.  I had also several tame sea-fowls, whose name
I knew not, that I caught upon the shore, and cut their wings; and the
little stakes which I had planted before my castle-wall being now grown
up to a good thick grove, these fowls all lived among these low trees,
and bred there, which was very agreeable to me; so that, as I said above,
I began to be very well contented with the life I led, if I could have
been secured from the dread of the savages.  But it was otherwise
directed; and it may not be amiss for all people who shall meet with my
story to make this just observation from it: How frequently, in the
course of our lives, the evil which in itself we seek most to shun, and
which, when we are fallen into, is the most dreadful to us, is oftentimes
the very means or door of our deliverance, by which alone we can be
raised again from the affliction we are fallen into.  I could give many
examples of this in the course of my unaccountable life; but in nothing
was it more particularly remarkable than in the circumstances of my last
years of solitary residence in this island.

It was now the month of December, as I said above, in my twenty-third
year; and this, being the southern solstice (for winter I cannot call
it), was the particular time of my harvest, and required me to be pretty
much abroad in the fields, when, going out early in the morning, even
before it was thorough daylight, I was surprised with seeing a light of
some fire upon the shore, at a distance from me of about two miles,
toward that part of the island where I had observed some savages had
been, as before, and not on the other side; but, to my great affliction,
it was on my side of the island.

I was indeed terribly surprised at the sight, and stopped short within my
grove, not daring to go out, lest I might be surprised; and yet I had no
more peace within, from the apprehensions I had that if these savages, in
rambling over the island, should find my corn standing or cut, or any of
my works or improvements, they would immediately conclude that there were
people in the place, and would then never rest till they had found me
out.  In this extremity I went back directly to my castle, pulled up the
ladder after me, and made all things without look as wild and natural as
I could.

Then I prepared myself within, putting myself in a posture of defence.  I
loaded all my cannon, as I called them—that is to say, my muskets, which
were mounted upon my new fortification—and all my pistols, and resolved
to defend myself to the last gasp—not forgetting seriously to commend
myself to the Divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver
me out of the hands of the barbarians.  I continued in this posture about
two hours, and began to be impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had
no spies to send out.  After sitting a while longer, and musing what I
should do in this case, I was not able to bear sitting in ignorance
longer; so setting up my ladder to the side of the hill, where there was
a flat place, as I observed before, and then pulling the ladder after me,
I set it up again and mounted the top of the hill, and pulling out my
perspective glass, which I had taken on purpose, I laid me down flat on
my belly on the ground, and began to look for the place.  I presently
found there were no less than nine naked savages sitting round a small
fire they had made, not to warm them, for they had no need of that, the
weather being extremely hot, but, as I supposed, to dress some of their
barbarous diet of human flesh which they had brought with them, whether
alive or dead I could not tell.

They had two canoes with them, which they had hauled up upon the shore;
and as it was then ebb of tide, they seemed to me to wait for the return
of the flood to go away again.  It is not easy to imagine what confusion
this sight put me into, especially seeing them come on my side of the
island, and so near to me; but when I considered their coming must be
always with the current of the ebb, I began afterwards to be more sedate
in my mind, being satisfied that I might go abroad with safety all the
time of the flood of tide, if they were not on shore before; and having
made this observation, I went abroad about my harvest work with the more
composure.

As I expected, so it proved; for as soon as the tide made to the westward
I saw them all take boat and row (or paddle as we call it) away.  I
should have observed, that for an hour or more before they went off they
were dancing, and I could easily discern their postures and gestures by
my glass.  I could not perceive, by my nicest observation, but that they
were stark naked, and had not the least covering upon them; but whether
they were men or women I could not distinguish.

As soon as I saw them shipped and gone, I took two guns upon my
shoulders, and two pistols in my girdle, and my great sword by my side
without a scabbard, and with all the speed I was able to make went away
to the hill where I had discovered the first appearance of all; and as
soon as I get thither, which was not in less than two hours (for I could
not go quickly, being so loaded with arms as I was), I perceived there
had been three canoes more of the savages at that place; and looking out
farther, I saw they were all at sea together, making over for the main.
This was a dreadful sight to me, especially as, going down to the shore,
I could see the marks of horror which the dismal work they had been about
had left behind it—viz. the blood, the bones, and part of the flesh of
human bodies eaten and devoured by those wretches with merriment and
sport.  I was so filled with indignation at the sight, that I now began
to premeditate the destruction of the next that I saw there, let them be
whom or how many soever.  It seemed evident to me that the visits which
they made thus to this island were not very frequent, for it was above
fifteen months before any more of them came on shore there again—that is
to say, I neither saw them nor any footsteps or signals of them in all
that time; for as to the rainy seasons, then they are sure not to come
abroad, at least not so far.  Yet all this while I lived uncomfortably,
by reason of the constant apprehensions of their coming upon me by
surprise: from whence I observe, that the expectation of evil is more
bitter than the suffering, especially if there is no room to shake off
that expectation or those apprehensions.

During all this time I was in a murdering humour, and spent most of my
hours, which should have been better employed, in contriving how to
circumvent and fall upon them the very next time I should see
them—especially if they should be divided, as they were the last time,
into two parties; nor did I consider at all that if I killed one
party—suppose ten or a dozen—I was still the next day, or week, or month,
to kill another, and so another, even _ad infinitum_, till I should be,
at length, no less a murderer than they were in being man-eaters—and
perhaps much more so.  I spent my days now in great perplexity and
anxiety of mind, expecting that I should one day or other fall, into the
hands of these merciless creatures; and if I did at any time venture
abroad, it was not without looking around me with the greatest care and
caution imaginable.  And now I found, to my great comfort, how happy it
was that I had provided a tame flock or herd of goats, for I durst not
upon any account fire my gun, especially near that side of the island
where they usually came, lest I should alarm the savages; and if they had
fled from me now, I was sure to have them come again with perhaps two or
three hundred canoes with them in a few days, and then I knew what to
expect.  However, I wore out a year and three months more before I ever
saw any more of the savages, and then I found them again, as I shall soon
observe.  It is true they might have been there once or twice; but either
they made no stay, or at least I did not see them; but in the month of
May, as near as I could calculate, and in my four-and-twentieth year, I
had a very strange encounter with them; of which in its place.

The perturbation of my mind during this fifteen or sixteen months’
interval was very great; I slept unquietly, dreamed always frightful
dreams, and often started out of my sleep in the night.  In the day great
troubles overwhelmed my mind; and in the night I dreamed often of killing
the savages and of the reasons why I might justify doing it.

But to waive all this for a while.  It was in the middle of May, on the
sixteenth day, I think, as well as my poor wooden calendar would reckon,
for I marked all upon the post still; I say, it was on the sixteenth of
May that it blew a very great storm of wind all day, with a great deal of
lightning and thunder, and; a very foul night it was after it.  I knew
not what was the particular occasion of it, but as I was reading in the
Bible, and taken up with very serious thoughts about my present
condition, I was surprised with the noise of a gun, as I thought, fired
at sea.  This was, to be sure, a surprise quite of a different nature
from any I had met with before; for the notions this put into my thoughts
were quite of another kind.  I started up in the greatest haste
imaginable; and, in a trice, clapped my ladder to the middle place of the
rock, and pulled it after me; and mounting it the second time, got to the
top of the hill the very moment that a flash of fire bid me listen for a
second gun, which, accordingly, in about half a minute I heard; and by
the sound, knew that it was from that part of the sea where I was driven
down the current in my boat.  I immediately considered that this must be
some ship in distress, and that they had some comrade, or some other ship
in company, and fired these for signals of distress, and to obtain help.
I had the presence of mind at that minute to think, that though I could
not help them, it might be that they might help me; so I brought together
all the dry wood I could get at hand, and making a good handsome pile, I
set it on fire upon the hill.  The wood was dry, and blazed freely; and,
though the wind blew very hard, yet it burned fairly out; so that I was
certain, if there was any such thing as a ship, they must needs see it.
And no doubt they did; for as soon as ever my fire blazed up, I heard
another gun, and after that several others, all from the same quarter.  I
plied my fire all night long, till daybreak: and when it was broad day,
and the air cleared up, I saw something at a great distance at sea, full
east of the island, whether a sail or a hull I could not distinguish—no,
not with my glass: the distance was so great, and the weather still
something hazy also; at least, it was so out at sea.

I looked frequently at it all that day, and soon perceived that it did
not move; so I presently concluded that it was a ship at anchor; and
being eager, you may be sure, to be satisfied, I took my gun in my hand,
and ran towards the south side of the island to the rocks where I had
formerly been carried away by the current; and getting up there, the
weather by this time being perfectly clear, I could plainly see, to my
great sorrow, the wreck of a ship, cast away in the night upon those
concealed rocks which I found when I was out in my boat; and which rocks,
as they checked the violence of the stream, and made a kind of
counter-stream, or eddy, were the occasion of my recovering from the most
desperate, hopeless condition that ever I had been in in all my life.
Thus, what is one man’s safety is another man’s destruction; for it seems
these men, whoever they were, being out of their knowledge, and the rocks
being wholly under water, had been driven upon them in the night, the
wind blowing hard at ENE.  Had they seen the island, as I must
necessarily suppose they did not, they must, as I thought, have
endeavoured to have saved themselves on shore by the help of their boat;
but their firing off guns for help, especially when they saw, as I
imagined, my fire, filled me with many thoughts.  First, I imagined that
upon seeing my light they might have put themselves into their boat, and
endeavoured to make the shore: but that the sea running very high, they
might have been cast away.  Other times I imagined that they might have
lost their boat before, as might be the case many ways; particularly by
the breaking of the sea upon their ship, which many times obliged men to
stave, or take in pieces, their boat, and sometimes to throw it overboard
with their own hands.  Other times I imagined they had some other ship or
ships in company, who, upon the signals of distress they made, had taken
them up, and carried them off.  Other times I fancied they were all gone
off to sea in their boat, and being hurried away by the current that I
had been formerly in, were carried out into the great ocean, where there
was nothing but misery and perishing: and that, perhaps, they might by
this time think of starving, and of being in a condition to eat one
another.

As all these were but conjectures at best, so, in the condition I was in,
I could do no more than look on upon the misery of the poor men, and pity
them; which had still this good effect upon my side, that it gave me more
and more cause to give thanks to God, who had so happily and comfortably
provided for me in my desolate condition; and that of two ships’
companies, who were now cast away upon this part of the world, not one
life should be spared but mine.  I learned here again to observe, that it
is very rare that the providence of God casts us into any condition so
low, or any misery so great, but we may see something or other to be
thankful for, and may see others in worse circumstances than our own.
Such certainly was the case of these men, of whom I could not so much as
see room to suppose any were saved; nothing could make it rational so
much as to wish or expect that they did not all perish there, except the
possibility only of their being taken up by another ship in company; and
this was but mere possibility indeed, for I saw not the least sign or
appearance of any such thing.  I cannot explain, by any possible energy
of words, what a strange longing I felt in my soul upon this sight,
breaking out sometimes thus: “Oh that there had been but one or two, nay,
or but one soul saved out of this ship, to have escaped to me, that I
might but have had one companion, one fellow-creature, to have spoken to
me and to have conversed with!”  In all the time of my solitary life I
never felt so earnest, so strong a desire after the society of my
fellow-creatures, or so deep a regret at the want of it.

There are some secret springs in the affections which, when they are set
a-going by some object in view, or, though not in view, yet rendered
present to the mind by the power of imagination, that motion carries out
the soul, by its impetuosity, to such violent, eager embracings of the
object, that the absence of it is insupportable.  Such were these earnest
wishings that but one man had been saved.  I believe I repeated the
words, “Oh that it had been but one!” a thousand times; and my desires
were so moved by it, that when I spoke the words my hands would clinch
together, and my fingers would press the palms of my hands, so that if I
had had any soft thing in my hand I should have crushed it involuntarily;
and the teeth in my head would strike together, and set against one
another so strong, that for some time I could not part them again.  Let
the naturalists explain these things, and the reason and manner of them.
All I can do is to describe the fact, which was even surprising to me
when I found it, though I knew not from whence it proceeded; it was
doubtless the effect of ardent wishes, and of strong ideas formed in my
mind, realising the comfort which the conversation of one of my
fellow-Christians would have been to me.  But it was not to be; either
their fate or mine, or both, forbade it; for, till the last year of my
being on this island, I never knew whether any were saved out of that
ship or no; and had only the affliction, some days after, to see the
corpse of a drowned boy come on shore at the end of the island which was
next the shipwreck.  He had no clothes on but a seaman’s waistcoat, a
pair of open-kneed linen drawers, and a blue linen shirt; but nothing to
direct me so much as to guess what nation he was of.  He had nothing in
his pockets but two pieces of eight and a tobacco pipe—the last was to me
of ten times more value than the first.

It was now calm, and I had a great mind to venture out in my boat to this
wreck, not doubting but I might find something on board that might be
useful to me.  But that did not altogether press me so much as the
possibility that there might be yet some living creature on board, whose
life I might not only save, but might, by saving that life, comfort my
own to the last degree; and this thought clung so to my heart that I
could not be quiet night or day, but I must venture out in my boat on
board this wreck; and committing the rest to God’s providence, I thought
the impression was so strong upon my mind that it could not be
resisted—that it must come from some invisible direction, and that I
should be wanting to myself if I did not go.

Under the power of this impression, I hastened back to my castle,
prepared everything for my voyage, took a quantity of bread, a great pot
of fresh water, a compass to steer by, a bottle of rum (for I had still a
great deal of that left), and a basket of raisins; and thus, loading
myself with everything necessary.  I went down to my boat, got the water
out of her, got her afloat, loaded all my cargo in her, and then went
home again for more.  My second cargo was a great bag of rice, the
umbrella to set up over my head for a shade, another large pot of water,
and about two dozen of small loaves, or barley cakes, more than before,
with a bottle of goat’s milk and a cheese; all which with great labour
and sweat I carried to my boat; and praying to God to direct my voyage, I
put out, and rowing or paddling the canoe along the shore, came at last
to the utmost point of the island on the north-east side.  And now I was
to launch out into the ocean, and either to venture or not to venture.  I
looked on the rapid currents which ran constantly on both sides of the
island at a distance, and which were very terrible to me from the
remembrance of the hazard I had been in before, and my heart began to
fail me; for I foresaw that if I was driven into either of those
currents, I should be carried a great way out to sea, and perhaps out of
my reach or sight of the island again; and that then, as my boat was but
small, if any little gale of wind should rise, I should be inevitably
lost.

These thoughts so oppressed my mind that I began to give over my
enterprise; and having hauled my boat into a little creek on the shore, I
stepped out, and sat down upon a rising bit of ground, very pensive and
anxious, between fear and desire, about my voyage; when, as I was musing,
I could perceive that the tide was turned, and the flood come on; upon
which my going was impracticable for so many hours.  Upon this, presently
it occurred to me that I should go up to the highest piece of ground I
could find, and observe, if I could, how the sets of the tide or currents
lay when the flood came in, that I might judge whether, if I was driven
one way out, I might not expect to be driven another way home, with the
same rapidity of the currents.  This thought was no sooner in my head
than I cast my eye upon a little hill which sufficiently overlooked the
sea both ways, and from whence I had a clear view of the currents or sets
of the tide, and which way I was to guide myself in my return.  Here I
found, that as the current of ebb set out close by the south point of the
island, so the current of the flood set in close by the shore of the
north side; and that I had nothing to do but to keep to the north side of
the island in my return, and I should do well enough.

Encouraged by this observation, I resolved the next morning to set out
with the first of the tide; and reposing myself for the night in my
canoe, under the watch-coat I mentioned, I launched out.  I first made a
little out to sea, full north, till I began to feel the benefit of the
current, which set eastward, and which carried me at a great rate; and
yet did not so hurry me as the current on the south side had done before,
so as to take from me all government of the boat; but having a strong
steerage with my paddle, I went at a great rate directly for the wreck,
and in less than two hours I came up to it.  It was a dismal sight to
look at; the ship, which by its building was Spanish, stuck fast, jammed
in between two rocks.  All the stern and quarter of her were beaten to
pieces by the sea; and as her forecastle, which stuck in the rocks, had
run on with great violence, her mainmast and foremast were brought by the
board—that is to say, broken short off; but her bowsprit was sound, and
the head and bow appeared firm.  When I came close to her, a dog appeared
upon her, who, seeing me coming, yelped and cried; and as soon as I
called him, jumped into the sea to come to me.  I took him into the boat,
but found him almost dead with hunger and thirst.  I gave him a cake of
my bread, and he devoured it like a ravenous wolf that had been starving
a fortnight in the snow; I then gave the poor creature some fresh water,
with which, if I would have let him, he would have burst himself.  After
this I went on board; but the first sight I met with was two men drowned
in the cook-room, or forecastle of the ship, with their arms fast about
one another.  I concluded, as is indeed probable, that when the ship
struck, it being in a storm, the sea broke so high and so continually
over her, that the men were not able to bear it, and were strangled with
the constant rushing in of the water, as much as if they had been under
water.  Besides the dog, there was nothing left in the ship that had
life; nor any goods, that I could see, but what were spoiled by the
water.  There were some casks of liquor, whether wine or brandy I knew
not, which lay lower in the hold, and which, the water being ebbed out, I
could see; but they were too big to meddle with.  I saw several chests,
which I believe belonged to some of the seamen; and I got two of them
into the boat, without examining what was in them.  Had the stern of the
ship been fixed, and the forepart broken off, I am persuaded I might have
made a good voyage; for by what I found in those two chests I had room to
suppose the ship had a great deal of wealth on board; and, if I may guess
from the course she steered, she must have been bound from Buenos Ayres,
or the Rio de la Plata, in the south part of America, beyond the Brazils
to the Havannah, in the Gulf of Mexico, and so perhaps to Spain.  She
had, no doubt, a great treasure in her, but of no use, at that time, to
anybody; and what became of the crew I then knew not.

I found, besides these chests, a little cask full of liquor, of about
twenty gallons, which I got into my boat with much difficulty.  There
were several muskets in the cabin, and a great powder-horn, with about
four pounds of powder in it; as for the muskets, I had no occasion for
them, so I left them, but took the powder-horn.  I took a fire-shovel and
tongs, which I wanted extremely, as also two little brass kettles, a
copper pot to make chocolate, and a gridiron; and with this cargo, and
the dog, I came away, the tide beginning to make home again—and the same
evening, about an hour within night, I reached the island again, weary
and fatigued to the last degree.  I reposed that night in the boat and in
the morning I resolved to harbour what I had got in my new cave, and not
carry it home to my castle.  After refreshing myself, I got all my cargo
on shore, and began to examine the particulars.  The cask of liquor I
found to be a kind of rum, but not such as we had at the Brazils; and, in
a word, not at all good; but when I came to open the chests, I found
several things of great use to me—for example, I found in one a fine case
of bottles, of an extraordinary kind, and filled with cordial waters,
fine and very good; the bottles held about three pints each, and were
tipped with silver.  I found two pots of very good succades, or
sweetmeats, so fastened also on the top that the salt-water had not hurt
them; and two more of the same, which the water had spoiled.  I found
some very good shirts, which were very welcome to me; and about a dozen
and a half of white linen handkerchiefs and coloured neckcloths; the
former were also very welcome, being exceedingly refreshing to wipe my
face in a hot day.  Besides this, when I came to the till in the chest, I
found there three great bags of pieces of eight, which held about eleven
hundred pieces in all; and in one of them, wrapped up in a paper, six
doubloons of gold, and some small bars or wedges of gold; I suppose they
might all weigh near a pound.  In the other chest were some clothes, but
of little value; but, by the circumstances, it must have belonged to the
gunner’s mate; though there was no powder in it, except two pounds of
fine glazed powder, in three flasks, kept, I suppose, for charging their
fowling-pieces on occasion.  Upon the whole, I got very little by this
voyage that was of any use to me; for, as to the money, I had no manner
of occasion for it; it was to me as the dirt under my feet, and I would
have given it all for three or four pair of English shoes and stockings,
which were things I greatly wanted, but had had none on my feet for many
years.  I had, indeed, got two pair of shoes now, which I took off the
feet of two drowned men whom I saw in the wreck, and I found two pair
more in one of the chests, which were very welcome to me; but they were
not like our English shoes, either for ease or service, being rather what
we call pumps than shoes.  I found in this seaman’s chest about fifty
pieces of eight, in rials, but no gold: I supposed this belonged to a
poorer man than the other, which seemed to belong to some officer.  Well,
however, I lugged this money home to my cave, and laid it up, as I had
done that before which I had brought from our own ship; but it was a
great pity, as I said, that the other part of this ship had not come to
my share: for I am satisfied I might have loaded my canoe several times
over with money; and, thought I, if I ever escape to England, it might
lie here safe enough till I come again and fetch it.




CHAPTER XIV—A DREAM REALISED


Having now brought all my things on shore and secured them, I went back
to my boat, and rowed or paddled her along the shore to her old harbour,
where I laid her up, and made the best of my way to my old habitation,
where I found everything safe and quiet.  I began now to repose myself,
live after my old fashion, and take care of my family affairs; and for a
while I lived easy enough, only that I was more vigilant than I used to
be, looked out oftener, and did not go abroad so much; and if at any time
I did stir with any freedom, it was always to the east part of the
island, where I was pretty well satisfied the savages never came, and
where I could go without so many precautions, and such a load of arms and
ammunition as I always carried with me if I went the other way.  I lived
in this condition near two years more; but my unlucky head, that was
always to let me know it was born to make my body miserable, was all
these two years filled with projects and designs how, if it were
possible, I might get away from this island: for sometimes I was for
making another voyage to the wreck, though my reason told me that there
was nothing left there worth the hazard of my voyage; sometimes for a
ramble one way, sometimes another—and I believe verily, if I had had the
boat that I went from Sallee in, I should have ventured to sea, bound
anywhere, I knew not whither.  I have been, in all my circumstances, a
memento to those who are touched with the general plague of mankind,
whence, for aught I know, one half of their miseries flow: I mean that of
not being satisfied with the station wherein God and Nature hath placed
them—for, not to look back upon my primitive condition, and the excellent
advice of my father, the opposition to which was, as I may call it, my
_original sin_, my subsequent mistakes of the same kind had been the
means of my coming into this miserable condition; for had that Providence
which so happily seated me at the Brazils as a planter blessed me with
confined desires, and I could have been contented to have gone on
gradually, I might have been by this time—I mean in the time of my being
in this island—one of the most considerable planters in the Brazils—nay,
I am persuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that little time I
lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had
remained, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores—and what
business had I to leave a settled fortune, a well-stocked plantation,
improving and increasing, to turn supercargo to Guinea to fetch negroes,
when patience and time would have so increased our stock at home, that we
could have bought them at our own door from those whose business it was
to fetch them? and though it had cost us something more, yet the
difference of that price was by no means worth saving at so great a
hazard.  But as this is usually the fate of young heads, so reflection
upon the folly of it is as commonly the exercise of more years, or of the
dear-bought experience of time—so it was with me now; and yet so deep had
the mistake taken root in my temper, that I could not satisfy myself in
my station, but was continually poring upon the means and possibility of
my escape from this place; and that I may, with greater pleasure to the
reader, bring on the remaining part of my story, it may not be improper
to give some account of my first conceptions on the subject of this
foolish scheme for my escape, and how, and upon what foundation, I acted.

I am now to be supposed retired into my castle, after my late voyage to
the wreck, my frigate laid up and secured under water, as usual, and my
condition restored to what it was before: I had more wealth, indeed, than
I had before, but was not at all the richer; for I had no more use for it
than the Indians of Peru had before the Spaniards came there.

It was one of the nights in the rainy season in March, the
four-and-twentieth year of my first setting foot in this island of
solitude, I was lying in my bed or hammock, awake, very well in health,
had no pain, no distemper, no uneasiness of body, nor any uneasiness of
mind more than ordinary, but could by no means close my eyes, that is, so
as to sleep; no, not a wink all night long, otherwise than as follows: It
is impossible to set down the innumerable crowd of thoughts that whirled
through that great thoroughfare of the brain, the memory, in this night’s
time.  I ran over the whole history of my life in miniature, or by
abridgment, as I may call it, to my coming to this island, and also of
that part of my life since I came to this island.  In my reflections upon
the state of my case since I came on shore on this island, I was
comparing the happy posture of my affairs in the first years of my
habitation here, with the life of anxiety, fear, and care which I had
lived in ever since I had seen the print of a foot in the sand.  Not that
I did not believe the savages had frequented the island even all the
while, and might have been several hundreds of them at times on shore
there; but I had never known it, and was incapable of any apprehensions
about it; my satisfaction was perfect, though my danger was the same, and
I was as happy in not knowing my danger as if I had never really been
exposed to it.  This furnished my thoughts with many very profitable
reflections, and particularly this one: How infinitely good that
Providence is, which has provided, in its government of mankind, such
narrow bounds to his sight and knowledge of things; and though he walks
in the midst of so many thousand dangers, the sight of which, if
discovered to him, would distract his mind and sink his spirits, he is
kept serene and calm, by having the events of things hid from his eyes,
and knowing nothing of the dangers which surround him.

After these thoughts had for some time entertained me, I came to reflect
seriously upon the real danger I had been in for so many years in this
very island, and how I had walked about in the greatest security, and
with all possible tranquillity, even when perhaps nothing but the brow of
a hill, a great tree, or the casual approach of night, had been between
me and the worst kind of destruction—viz. that of falling into the hands
of cannibals and savages, who would have seized on me with the same view
as I would on a goat or turtle; and have thought it no more crime to kill
and devour me than I did of a pigeon or a curlew.  I would unjustly
slanuital, they should, when I had put weapons into their hands,
carry me by force among their own people, I might be ill-used for my
kindness to them, and make my case worse than it was before.

He answered, with a great deal of candour and ingenuousness, that their
condition was so miserable, and that they were so sensible of it, that he
believed they would abhor the thought of using any man unkindly that
should contribute to their deliverance; and that, if I pleased, he would
go to them with the old man, and discourse with them about it, and return
again and bring me their answer; that he would make conditions with them
upon their solemn oath, that they should be absolutely under my direction
as their commander and captain; and they should swear upon the holy
sacraments and gospel to be true to me, and go to such Christian country
as I should agree to, and no other; and to be directed wholly and
absolutely by my orders till they were landed safely in such country as I
intended, and that he would bring a contract from them, under their
hands, for that purpose.  Then he told me he would first swear to me
himself that he would never stir from me as long as he lived till I gave
him orders; and that he would take my side to the last drop of his blood,
if there should happen the least breach of faith among his countrymen.
He told me they were all of them very civil, honest men, and they were
under the greatest distress imaginable, having neither weapons nor
clothes, nor any food, but at the mercy and discretion of the savages;
out of all hopes of ever returning to their own country; and that he was
sure, if I would undertake their relief, they would live and die by me.

Upon these assurances, I resolved to venture to relieve them, if
possible, and to send the old savage and this Spaniard over to them to
treat.  But when we had got all things in readiness to go, the Spaniard
himself started an objection, which had so much prudence in it on one
hand, and so much sincerity on the other hand, that I could not but be
very well satisfied in it; and, by his advice, put off the deliverance of
his comrades for at least half a year.  The case was thus: he had been
with us now about a month, during which time I had let him see in what
manner I had provided, with the assistance of Providence, for my support;
and he saw evidently what stock of corn and rice I had laid up; which,
though it was more than sufficient for myself, yet it was not sufficient,
without good husbandry, for my family, now it was increased to four; but
much less would it be sufficient if his countrymen, who were, as he said,
sixteen, still alive, should come over; and least of all would it be
sufficient to victual our vessel, if we should build one, for a voyage to
any of the Christian colonies of America; so he told me he thought it
would be more advisable to let him and the other two dig and cultivate
some more land, as much as I could spare seed to sow, and that we should
wait another harvest, that we might have a supply of corn for his
countrymen, when they should come; for want might be a temptation to them
to disagree, or not to think themselves delivered, otherwise than out of
one difficulty into another.  “You know,” says he, “the children of
Israel, though they rejoiced at first for their being delivered out of
Egypt, yet rebelled even against God Himself, that delivered them, when
they came to want bread in the wilderness.”

His caution was so seasonable, and his advice so good, that I could not
but be very well pleased with his proposal, as well as I was satisfied
with his fidelity; so we fell to digging, all four of us, as well as the
wooden tools we were furnished with permitted; and in about a month’s
time, by the end of which it was seed-time, we had got as much land cured
and trimmed up as we sowed two-and-twenty bushels of barley on, and
sixteen jars of rice, which was, in short, all the seed we had to spare:
indeed, we left ourselves barely sufficient, for our own food for the six
months that we had to expect our crop; that is to say reckoning from the
time we set our seed aside for sowing; for it is not to be supposed it is
six months in the ground in that country.

Having now society enough, and our numbers being sufficient to put us out
of fear of the savages, if they had come, unless their number had been
very great, we went freely all over the island, whenever we found
occasion; and as we had our escape or deliverance upon our thoughts, it
was impossible, at least for me, to have the means of it out of mine.
For this purpose I marked out several trees, which I thought fit for our
work, and I set Friday and his father to cut them down; and then I caused
the Spaniard, to whom I imparted my thoughts on that affair, to oversee
and direct their work.  I showed them with what indefatigable pains I had
hewed a large tree into single planks, and I caused them to do the like,
till they made about a dozen large planks, of good oak, near two feet
broad, thirty-five feet long, and from two inches to four inches thick:
what prodigious labour it took up any one may imagine.

At the same time I contrived to increase my little flock of tame goats as
much as I could; and for this purpose I made Friday and the Spaniard go
out one day, and myself with Friday the next day (for we took our turns),
and by this means we got about twenty young kids to breed up with the
rest; for whenever we shot the dam, we saved the kids, and added them to
our flock.  But above all, the season for curing the grapes coming on, I
caused such a prodigious quantity to be hung up in the sun, that, I
believe, had we been at Alicant, where the raisins of the sun are cured,
we could have filled sixty or eighty barrels; and these, with our bread,
formed a great part of our food—very good living too, I assure you, for
they are exceedingly nourishing.

It was now harvest, and our crop in good order: it was not the most
plentiful increase I had seen in the island, but, however, it was enough
to answer our end; for from twenty-two bushels of barley we brought in
and thrashed out above two hundred and twenty bushels; and the like in
proportion of the rice; which was store enough for our food to the next
harvest, though all the sixteen Spaniards had been on shore with me; or,
if we had been ready for a voyage, it would very plentifully have
victualled our ship to have carried us to any part of the world; that is
to say, any part of America.  When we had thus housed and secured our
magazine of corn, we fell to work to make more wicker-ware, viz. great
baskets, in which we kept it; and the Spaniard was very handy and
dexterous at this part, and often blamed me that I did not make some
things for defence of this kind of work; but I saw no need of it.

And now, having a full supply of food for all the guests I expected, I
gave the Spaniard leave to go over to the main, to see what he could do
with those he had left behind him there.  I gave him a strict charge not
to bring any man who would not first swear in the presence of himself and
the old savage that he would in no way injure, fight with, or attack the
person he should find in the island, who was so kind as to send for them
in order to their deliverance; but that they would stand by him and
defend him against all such attempts, and wherever they went would be
entirely under and subjected to his command; and that this should be put
in writing, and signed in their hands.  How they were to have done this,
when I knew they had neither pen nor ink, was a question which we never
asked.  Under these instructions, the Spaniard and the old savage, the
father of Friday, went away in one of the canoes which they might be said
to have come in, or rather were brought in, when they came as prisoners
to be devoured by the savages.  I gave each of them a musket, with a
firelock on it, and about eight charges of powder and ball, charging them
to be very good husbands of both, and not to use either of them but upon
urgent occasions.

This was a cheerful work, being the first measures used by me in view of
my deliverance for now twenty-seven years and some days.  I gave them
provisions of bread and of dried grapes, sufficient for themselves for
many days, and sufficient for all the Spaniards—for about eight days’
time; and wishing them a good voyage, I saw them go, agreeing with them
about a signal they should hang out at their return, by which I should
know them again when they came back, at a distance, before they came on
shore.  They went away with a fair gale on the day that the moon was at
full, by my account in the month of October; but as for an exact
reckoning of days, after I had once lost it I could never recover it
again; nor had I kept even the number of years so punctually as to be
sure I was right; though, as it proved when I afterwards examined my
account, I found I had kept a true reckoning of years.

It was no less than eight days I had waited for them, when a strange and
unforeseen accident intervened, of which the like has not, perhaps, been
heard of in history.  I was fast asleep in my hutch one morning, when my
man Friday came running in to me, and called aloud, “Master, master, they
are come, they are come!”  I jumped up, and regardless of danger I went,
as soon as I could get my clothes on, through my little grove, which, by
the way, was by this time grown to be a very thick wood; I say,
regardless of danger I went without my arms, which was not my custom to
do; but I was surprised when, turning my eyes to the sea, I presently saw
a boat at about a league and a half distance, standing in for the shore,
with a shoulder-of-mutton sail, as they call it, and the wind blowing
pretty fair to bring them in: also I observed, presently, that they did
not come from that side which the shore lay on, but from the southernmost
end of the island.  Upon this I called Friday in, and bade him lie close,
for these were not the people we looked for, and that we might not know
yet whether they were friends or enemies.  In the next place I went in to
fetch my perspective glass to see what I could make of them; and having
taken the ladder out, I climbed up to the top of the hill, as I used to
do when I was apprehensive of anything, and to take my view the plainer
without being discovered.  I had scarce set my foot upon the hill when my
eye plainly discovered a ship lying at anchor, at about two leagues and a
half distance from me, SSE., but not above a league and a half from the
shore.  By my observation it appeared plainly to be an English ship, and
the boat appeared to be an English long-boat.

I cannot express the confusion I was in, though the joy of seeing a ship,
and one that I had reason to believe was manned by my own countrymen, and
consequently friends, was such as I cannot describe; but yet I had some
secret doubts hung about me—I cannot tell from whence they came—bidding
me keep upon my guard.  In the first place, it occurred to me to consider
what business an English ship could have in that part of the world, since
it was not the way to or from any part of the world where the English had
any traffic; and I knew there had been no storms to drive them in there
in distress; and that if they were really English it was most probable
that they were here upon no good design; and that I had better continue
as I was than fall into the hands of thieves and murderers.

Let no man despise the secret hints and notices of danger which sometimes
are given him when he may think there is no possibility of its being
real.  That such hints and notices are given us I believe few that have
made any observation of things can deny; that they are certain
discoveries of an invisible world, and a converse of spirits, we cannot
doubt; and if the tendency of them seems to be to warn us of danger, why
should we not suppose they are from some friendly agent (whether supreme,
or inferior and subordinate, is not the question), and that they are
given for our good?

The present question abundantly confirms me in the justice of this
reasoning; for had I not been made cautious by this secret admonition,
come it from whence it will, I had been done inevitably, and in a far
worse condition than before, as you will see presently.  I had not kept
myself long in this posture till I saw the boat draw near the shore, as
if they looked for a creek to thrust in at, for the convenience of
landing; however, as they did not come quite far enough, they did not see
the little inlet where I formerly landed my rafts, but ran their boat on
shore upon the beach, at about half a mile from me, which was very happy
for me; for otherwise they would have landed just at my door, as I may
say, and would soon have beaten me out of my castle, and perhaps have
plundered me of all I had.  When they were on shore I was fully satisfied
they were Englishmen, at least most of them; one or two I thought were
Dutch, but it did not prove so; there were in all eleven men, whereof
three of them I found were unarmed and, as I thought, bound; and when the
first four or five of them were jumped on shore, they took those three
out of the boat as prisoners: one of the three I could perceive using the
most passionate gestures of entreaty, affliction, and despair, even to a
kind of extravagance; the other two, I could perceive, lifted up their
hands sometimes, and appeared concerned indeed, but not to such a degree
as the first.  I was perfectly confounded at the sight, and knew not what
the meaning of it should be.  Friday called out to me in English, as well
as he could, “O master! you see English mans eat prisoner as well as
savage mans.”  “Why, Friday,” says I, “do you think they are going to eat
them, then?”  “Yes,” says Friday, “they will eat them.”  “No no,” says I,
“Friday; I am afraid they will murder them, indeed; but you may be sure
they will not eat them.”

All this while I had no thought of what the matter really was, but stood
trembling with the horror of the sight, expecting every moment when the
three prisoners should be killed; nay, once I saw one of the villains
lift up his arm with a great cutlass, as the seamen call it, or sword, to
strike one of the poor men; and I expected to see him fall every moment;
at which all the blood in my body seemed to run chill in my veins.  I
wished heartily now for the Spaniard, and the savage that had gone with
him, or that I had any way to have come undiscovered within shot of them,
that I might have secured the three men, for I saw no firearms they had
among them; but it fell out to my mind another way.  After I had observed
the outrageous usage of the three men by the insolent seamen, I observed
the fellows run scattering about the island, as if they wanted to see the
country.  I observed that the three other men had liberty to go also
where they pleased; but they sat down all three upon the ground, very
pensive, and looked like men in despair.  This put me in mind of the
first time when I came on shore, and began to look about me; how I gave
myself over for lost; how wildly I looked round me; what dreadful
apprehensions I had; and how I lodged in the tree all night for fear of
being devoured by wild beasts.  As I knew nothing that night of the
supply I was to receive by the providential driving of the ship nearer
the land by the storms and tide, by which I have since been so long
nourished and supported; so these three poor desolate men knew nothing
how certain of deliverance and supply they were, how near it was to them,
and how effectually and really they were in a condition of safety, at the
same time that they thought themselves lost and their case desperate.  So
little do we see before us in the world, and so much reason have we to
depend cheerfully upon the great Maker of the world, that He does not
leave His creatures so absolutely destitute, but that in the worst
circumstances they have always something to be thankful for, and
sometimes are nearer deliverance than they imagine; nay, are even brought
to their deliverance by the means by which they seem to be brought to
their destruction.

It was just at high-water when these people came on shore; and while they
rambled about to see what kind of a place they were in, they had
carelessly stayed till the tide was spent, and the water was ebbed
considerably away, leaving their boat aground.  They had left two men in
the boat, who, as I found afterwards, having drunk a little too much
brandy, fell asleep; however, one of them waking a little sooner than the
other and finding the boat too fast aground for him to stir it, hallooed
out for the rest, who were straggling about: upon which they all soon
came to the boat: but it was past all their strength to launch her, the
boat being very heavy, and the shore on that side being a soft oozy sand,
almost like a quicksand.  In this condition, like true seamen, who are,
perhaps, the least of all mankind given to forethought, they gave it
over, and away they strolled about the country again; and I heard one of
them say aloud to another, calling them off from the boat, “Why, let her
alone, Jack, can’t you? she’ll float next tide;” by which I was fully
confirmed in the main inquiry of what countrymen they were.  All this
while I kept myself very close, not once daring to stir out of my castle
any farther than to my place of observation near the top of the hill: and
very glad I was to think how well it was fortified.  I knew it was no
less than ten hours before the boat could float again, and by that time
it would be dark, and I might be at more liberty to see their motions,
and to hear their discourse, if they had any.  In the meantime I fitted
myself up for a battle as before, though with more caution, knowing I had
to do with another kind of enemy than I had at first.  I ordered Friday
also, whom I had made an excellent marksman with his gun, to load himself
with arms.  I took myself two fowling-pieces, and I gave him three
muskets.  My figure, indeed, was very fierce; I had my formidable
goat-skin coat on, with the great cap I have mentioned, a naked sword by
my side, two pistols in my belt, and a gun upon each shoulder.

It was my design, as I said above, not to have made any attempt till it
was dark; but about two o’clock, being the heat of the day, I found that
they were all gone straggling into the woods, and, as I thought, laid
down to sleep.  The three poor distressed men, too anxious for their
condition to get any sleep, had, however, sat down under the shelter of a
great tree, at about a quarter of a mile from me, and, as I thought, out
of sight of any of the rest.  Upon this I resolved to discover myself to
them, and learn something of their condition; immediately I marched as
above, my man Friday at a good distance behind me, as formidable for his
arms as I, but not making quite so staring a spectre-like figure as I
did.  I came as near them undiscovered as I could, and then, before any
of them saw me, I called aloud to them in Spanish, “What are ye,
gentlemen?”  They started up at the noise, but were ten times more
confounded when they saw me, and the uncouth figure that I made.  They
made no answer at all, but I thought I perceived them just going to fly
from me, when I spoke to them in English. “Gentlemen,” said I, “do not be
surprised at me; perhaps you may have a friend near when you did not
expect it.”  “He must be sent directly from heaven then,” said one of
them very gravely to me, and pulling off his hat at the same time to me;
“for our condition is past the help of man.”  “All help is from heaven,
sir,” said I, “but can you put a stranger in the way to help you? for you
seem to be in some great distress.  I saw you when you landed; and when
you seemed to make application to the brutes that came with you, I saw
one of them lift up his sword to kill you.”

The poor man, with tears running down his face, and trembling, looking
like one astonished, returned, “Am I talking to God or man?  Is it a real
man or an angel?”  “Be in no fear about that, sir,” said I; “if God had
sent an angel to relieve you, he would have come better clothed, and
armed after another manner than you see me; pray lay aside your fears; I
am a man, an Englishman, and disposed to assist you; you see I have one
servant only; we have arms and ammunition; tell us freely, can we serve
you?  What is your case?”  “Our case, sir,” said he, “is too long to tell
you while our murderers are so near us; but, in short, sir, I was
commander of that ship—my men have mutinied against me; they have been
hardly prevailed on not to murder me, and, at last, have set me on shore
in this desolate place, with these two men with me—one my mate, the other
a passenger—where we expected to perish, believing the place to be
uninhabited, and know not yet what to think of it.”  “Where are these
brutes, your enemies?” said I; “do you know where they are gone?  There
they lie, sir,” said he, pointing to a thicket of trees; “my heart
trembles for fear they have seen us and heard you speak; if they have,
they will certainly murder us all.”  “Have they any firearms?” said I.
He answered, “They had only two pieces, one of which they left in the
boat.”  “Well, then,” said I, “leave the rest to me; I see they are all
asleep; it is an easy thing to kill them all; but shall we rather take
them prisoners?”  He told me there were two desperate villains among them
that it was scarce safe to show any mercy to; but if they were secured,
he believed all the rest would return to their duty.  I asked him which
they were.  He told me he could not at that distance distinguish them,
but he would obey my orders in anything I would direct.  “Well,” says I,
“let us retreat out of their view or hearing, lest they awake, and we
will resolve further.”  So they willingly went back with me, till the
woods covered us from them.

“Look you, sir,” said I, “if I venture upon your deliverance, are you
willing to make two conditions with me?”  He anticipated my proposals by
telling me that both he and the ship, if recovered, should be wholly
directed and commanded by me in everything; and if the ship was not
recovered, he would live and die with me in what part of the world soever
I would send him; and the two other men said the same.  “Well,” says I,
“my conditions are but two; first, that while you stay in this island
with me, you will not pretend to any authority here; and if I put arms in
your hands, you will, upon all occasions, give them up to me, and do no
prejudice to me or mine upon this island, and in the meantime be governed
by my orders; secondly, that if the ship is or may be recovered, you will
carry me and my man to England passage free.”

He gave me all the assurances that the invention or faith of man could
devise that he would comply with these most reasonable demands, and
besides would owe his life to me, and acknowledge it upon all occasions
as long as he lived.  “Well, then,” said I, “here are three muskets for
you, with powder and ball; tell me next what you think is proper to be
done.”  He showed all the testimonies of his gratitude that he was able,
but offered to be wholly guided by me.  I told him I thought it was very
hard venturing anything; but the best method I could think of was to fire
on them at once as they lay, and if any were not killed at the first
volley, and offered to submit, we might save them, and so put it wholly
upon God’s providence to direct the shot.  He said, very modestly, that
he was loath to kill them if he could help it; but that those two were
incorrigible villains, and had been the authors of all the mutiny in the
ship, and if they escaped, we should be undone still, for they would go
on board and bring the whole ship’s company, and destroy us all.  “Well,
then,” says I, “necessity legitimates my advice, for it is the only way
to save our lives.”  However, seeing him still cautious of shedding
blood, I told him they should go themselves, and manage as they found
convenient.

In the middle of this discourse we heard some of them awake, and soon
after we saw two of them on their feet.  I asked him if either of them
were the heads of the mutiny?  He said, “No.”  “Well, then,” said I, “you
may let them escape; and Providence seems to have awakened them on
purpose to save themselves.  Now,” says I, “if the rest escape you, it is
your fault.”  Animated with this, he took the musket I had given him in
his hand, and a pistol in his belt, and his two comrades with him, with
each a piece in his hand; the two men who were with him going first made
some noise, at which one of the seamen who was awake turned about, and
seeing them coming, cried out to the rest; but was too late then, for the
moment he cried out they fired—I mean the two men, the captain wisely
reserving his own piece.  They had so well aimed their shot at the men
they knew, that one of them was killed on the spot, and the other very
much wounded; but not being dead, he started up on his feet, and called
eagerly for help to the other; but the captain stepping to him, told him
it was too late to cry for help, he should call upon God to forgive his
villainy, and with that word knocked him down with the stock of his
musket, so that he never spoke more; there were three more in the
company, and one of them was slightly wounded.  By this time I was come;
and when they saw their danger, and that it was in vain to resist, they
begged for mercy.  The captain told them he would spare their lives if
they would give him an assurance of their abhorrence of the treachery
they had been guilty of, and would swear to be faithful to him in
recovering the ship, and afterwards in carrying her back to Jamaica, from
whence they came.  They gave him all the protestations of their sincerity
that could be desired; and he was willing to believe them, and spare
their lives, which I was not against, only that I obliged him to keep
them bound hand and foot while they were on the island.

While this was doing, I sent Friday with the captain’s mate to the boat
with orders to secure her, and bring away the oars and sails, which they
did; and by-and-by three straggling men, that were (happily for them)
parted from the rest, came back upon hearing the guns fired; and seeing
the captain, who was before their prisoner, now their conqueror, they
submitted to be bound also; and so our victory was complete.

It now remained that the captain and I should inquire into one another’s
circumstances.  I began first, and told him my whole history, which he
heard with an attention even to amazement—and particularly at the
wonderful manner of my being furnished with provisions and ammunition;
and, indeed, as my story is a whole collection of wonders, it affected
him deeply.  But when he reflected from thence upon himself, and how I
seemed to have been preserved there on purpose to save his life, the
tears ran down his face, and he could not speak a word more.  After this
communication was at an end, I carried him and his two men into my
apartment, leading them in just where I came out, viz. at the top of the
house, where I refreshed them with such provisions as I had, and showed
them all the contrivances I had made during my long, long inhabiting that
place.

All I showed them, all I said to them, was perfectly amazing; but above
all, the captain admired my fortification, and how perfectly I had
concealed my retreat with a grove of trees, which having been now planted
nearly twenty years, and the trees growing much faster than in England,
was become a little wood, so thick that it was impassable in any part of
it but at that one side where I had reserved my little winding passage
into it.  I told him this was my castle and my residence, but that I had
a seat in the country, as most princes have, whither I could retreat upon
occasion, and I would show him that too another time; but at present our
business was to consider how to recover the ship.  He agreed with me as
to that, but told me he was perfectly at a loss what measures to take,
for that there were still six-and-twenty hands on board, who, having
entered into a cursed conspiracy, by which they had all forfeited their
lives to the law, would be hardened in it now by desperation, and would
carry it on, knowing that if they were subdued they would be brought to
the gallows as soon as they came to England, or to any of the English
colonies, and that, therefore, there would be no attacking them with so
small a number as we were.

I mused for some time on what he had said, and found it was a very
rational conclusion, and that therefore something was to be resolved on
speedily, as well to draw the men on board into some snare for their
surprise as to prevent their landing upon us, and destroying us.  Upon
this, it presently occurred to me that in a little while the ship’s crew,
wondering what was become of their comrades and of the boat, would
certainly come on shore in their other boat to look for them, and that
then, perhaps, they might come armed, and be too strong for us: this he
allowed to be rational.  Upon this, I told him the first thing we had to
do was to stave the boat which lay upon the beach, so that they might not
carry her of, and taking everything out of her, leave her so far useless
as not to be fit to swim.  Accordingly, we went on board, took the arms
which were left on board out of her, and whatever else we found
there—which was a bottle of brandy, and another of rum, a few
biscuit-cakes, a horn of powder, and a great lump of sugar in a piece of
canvas (the sugar was five or six pounds): all which was very welcome to
me, especially the brandy and sugar, of which I had had none left for
many years.

When we had carried all these things on shore (the oars, mast, sail, and
rudder of the boat were carried away before), we knocked a great hole in
her bottom, that if they had come strong enough to master us, yet they
could not carry off the boat.  Indeed, it was not much in my thoughts
that we could be able to recover the ship; but my view was, that if they
went away without the boat, I did not much question to make her again fit
to carry as to the Leeward Islands, and call upon our friends the
Spaniards in my way, for I had them still in my thoughts.




CHAPTER XVIII—THE SHIP RECOVERED


While we were thus preparing our designs, and had first, by main
strength, heaved the boat upon the beach, so high that the tide would not
float her off at high-water mark, and besides, had broke a hole in her
bottom too big to be quickly stopped, and were set down musing what we
should do, we heard the ship fire a gun, and make a waft with her ensign
as a signal for the boat to come on board—but no boat stirred; and they
fired several times, making other signals for the boat.  At last, when
all their signals and firing proved fruitless, and they found the boat
did not stir, we saw them, by the help of my glasses, hoist another boat
out and row towards the shore; and we found, as they approached, that
there were no less than ten men in her, and that they had firearms with
them.

As the ship lay almost two leagues from the shore, we had a full view of
them as they came, and a plain sight even of their faces; because the
tide having set them a little to the east of the other boat, they rowed
up under shore, to come to the same place where the other had landed, and
where the boat lay; by this means, I say, we had a full view of them, and
the captain knew the persons and characters of all the men in the boat,
of whom, he said, there were three very honest fellows, who, he was sure,
were led into this conspiracy by the rest, being over-powered and
frightened; but that as for the boatswain, who it seems was the chief
officer among them, and all the rest, they were as outrageous as any of
the ship’s crew, and were no doubt made desperate in their new
enterprise; and terribly apprehensive he was that they would be too
powerful for us.  I smiled at him, and told him that men in our
circumstances were past the operation of fear; that seeing almost every
condition that could be was better than that which we were supposed to be
in, we ought to expect that the consequence, whether death or life, would
be sure to be a deliverance.  I asked him what he thought of the
circumstances of my life, and whether a deliverance were not worth
venturing for?  “And where, sir,” said I, “is your belief of my being
preserved here on purpose to save your life, which elevated you a little
while ago?  For my part,” said I, “there seems to be but one thing amiss
in all the prospect of it.”  “What is that?” say he.  “Why,” said I, “it
is, that as you say there are three or four honest fellows among them
which should be spared, had they been all of the wicked part of the crew
I should have thought God’s providence had singled them out to deliver
them into your hands; for depend upon it, every man that comes ashore is
our own, and shall die or live as they behave to us.”  As I spoke this
with a raised voice and cheerful countenance, I found it greatly
encouraged him; so we set vigorously to our business.

We had, upon the first appearance of the boat’s coming from the ship,
considered of separating our prisoners; and we had, indeed, secured them
effectually.  Two of them, of whom the captain was less assured than
ordinary, I sent with Friday, and one of the three delivered men, to my
cave, where they were remote enough, and out of danger of being heard or
discovered, or of finding their way out of the woods if they could have
delivered themselves.  Here they left them bound, but gave them
provisions; and promised them, if they continued there quietly, to give
them their liberty in a day or two; but that if they attempted their
escape they should be put to death without mercy.  They promised
faithfully to bear their confinement with patience, and were very
thankful that they had such good usage as to have provisions and light
left them; for Friday gave them candles (such as we made ourselves) for
their comfort; and they did not know but that he stood sentinel over them
at the entrance.

The other prisoners had better usage; two of them were kept pinioned,
indeed, because the captain was not able to trust them; but the other two
were taken into my service, upon the captain’s recommendation, and upon
their solemnly engaging to live and die with us; so with them and the
three honest men we were seven men, well armed; and I made no doubt we
should be able to deal well enough with the ten that were coming,
considering that the captain had said there were three or four honest men
among them also.  As soon as they got to the place where their other boat
lay, they ran their boat into the beach and came all on shore, hauling
the boat up after them, which I was glad to see, for I was afraid they
would rather have left the boat at an anchor some distance from the
shore, with some hands in her to guard her, and so we should not be able
to seize the boat.  Being on shore, the first thing they did, they ran
all to their other boat; and it was easy to see they were under a great
surprise to find her stripped, as above, of all that was in her, and a
great hole in her bottom.  After they had mused a while upon this, they
set up two or three great shouts, hallooing with all their might, to try
if they could make their companions hear; but all was to no purpose.
Then they came all close in a ring, and fired a volley of their small
arms, which indeed we heard, and the echoes made the woods ring.  But it
was all one; those in the cave, we were sure, could not hear; and those
in our keeping, though they heard it well enough, yet durst give no
answer to them.  They were so astonished at the surprise of this, that,
as they told us afterwards, they resolved to go all on board again to
their ship, and let them know that the men were all murdered, and the
long-boat staved; accordingly, they immediately launched their boat
again, and got all of them on board.

The captain was terribly amazed, and even confounded, at this, believing
they would go on board the ship again and set sail, giving their comrades
over for lost, and so he should still lose the ship, which he was in
hopes we should have recovered; but he was quickly as much frightened the
other way.

They had not been long put off with the boat, when we perceived them all
coming on shore again; but with this new measure in their conduct, which
it seems they consulted together upon, viz. to leave three men in the
boat, and the rest to go on shore, and go up into the country to look for
their fellows.  This was a great disappointment to us, for now we were at
a loss what to do, as our seizing those seven men on shore would be no
advantage to us if we let the boat escape; because they would row away to
the ship, and then the rest of them would be sure to weigh and set sail,
and so our recovering the ship would be lost.  However we had no remedy
but to wait and see what the issue of things might present.  The seven
men came on shore, and the three who remained in the boat put her off to
a good distance from the shore, and came to an anchor to wait for them;
so that it was impossible for us to come at them in the boat.  Those that
came on shore kept close together, marching towards the top of the little
hill under which my habitation lay; and we could see them plainly, though
they could not perceive us.  We should have been very glad if they would
have come nearer us, so that we might have fired at them, or that they
would have gone farther off, that we might come abroad.  But when they
were come to the brow of the hill where they could see a great way into
the valleys and woods, which lay towards the north-east part, and where
the island lay lowest, they shouted and hallooed till they were weary;
and not caring, it seems, to venture far from the shore, nor far from one
another, they sat down together under a tree to consider it.  Had they
thought fit to have gone to sleep there, as the other part of them had
done, they had done the job for us; but they were too full of
apprehensions of danger to venture to go to sleep, though they could not
tell what the danger was they had to fear.

The captain made a very just proposal to me upon this consultation of
theirs, viz. that perhaps they would all fire a volley again, to
endeavour to make their fellows hear, and that we should all sally upon
them just at the juncture when their pieces were all discharged, and they
would certainly yield, and we should have them without bloodshed.  I
liked this proposal, provided it was done while we were near enough to
come up to them before they could load their pieces again.  But this
event did not happen; and we lay still a long time, very irresolute what
course to take.  At length I told them there would be nothing done, in my
opinion, till night; and then, if they did not return to the boat,
perhaps we might find a way to get between them and the shore, and so
might use some stratagem with them in the boat to get them on shore.  We
waited a great while, though very impatient for their removing; and were
very uneasy when, after long consultation, we saw them all start up and
march down towards the sea; it seems they had such dreadful apprehensions
of the danger of the place that they resolved to go on board the ship
again, give their companions over for lost, and so go on with their
intended voyage with the ship.

As soon as I perceived them go towards the shore, I imagined it to be as
it really was that they had given over their search, and were going back
again; and the captain, as soon as I told him my thoughts, was ready to
sink at the apprehensions of it; but I presently thought of a stratagem
to fetch them back again, and which answered my end to a tittle.  I
ordered Friday and the captain’s mate to go over the little creek
westward, towards the place where the savages came on shore, when Friday
was rescued, and so soon as they came to a little rising round, at about
half a mile distant, I bid them halloo out, as loud as they could, and
wait till they found the seamen heard them; that as soon as ever they
heard the seamen answer them, they should return it again; and then,
keeping out of sight, take a round, always answering when the others
hallooed, to draw them as far into the island and among the woods as
possible, and then wheel about again to me by such ways as I directed
them.

They were just going into the boat when Friday and the mate hallooed; and
they presently heard them, and answering, ran along the shore westward,
towards the voice they heard, when they were stopped by the creek, where
the water being up, they could not get over, and called for the boat to
come up and set them over; as, indeed, I expected.  When they had set
themselves over, I observed that the boat being gone a good way into the
creek, and, as it were, in a harbour within the land, they took one of
the three men out of her, to go along with them, and left only two in the
boat, having fastened her to the stump of a little tree on the shore.
This was what I wished for; and immediately leaving Friday and the
captain’s mate to their business, I took the rest with me; and, crossing
the creek out of their sight, we surprised the two men before they were
aware—one of them lying on the shore, and the other being in the boat.
The fellow on shore was between sleeping and waking, and going to start
up; the captain, who was foremost, ran in upon him, and knocked him down;
and then called out to him in the boat to yield, or he was a dead man.
They needed very few arguments to persuade a single man to yield, when he
saw five men upon him and his comrade knocked down: besides, this was, it
seems, one of the three who were not so hearty in the mutiny as the rest
of the crew, and therefore was easily persuaded not only to yield, but
afterwards to join very sincerely with us.  In the meantime, Friday and
the captain’s mate so well managed their business with the rest that they
drew them, by hallooing and answering, from one hill to another, and from
one wood to another, till they not only heartily tired them, but left
them where they were, very sure they could not reach back to the boat
before it was dark; and, indeed, they were heartily tired themselves
also, by the time they came back to us.

We had nothing now to do but to watch for them in the dark, and to fall
upon them, so as to make sure work with them.  It was several hours after
Friday came back to me before they came back to their boat; and we could
hear the foremost of them, long before they came quite up, calling to
those behind to come along; and could also hear them answer, and complain
how lame and tired they were, and not able to come any faster: which was
very welcome news to us.  At length they came up to the boat: but it is
impossible to express their confusion when they found the boat fast
aground in the creek, the tide ebbed out, and their two men gone.  We
could hear them call one to another in a most lamentable manner, telling
one another they were got into an enchanted island; that either there
were inhabitants in it, and they should all be murdered, or else there
were devils and spirits in it, and they should be all carried away and
devoured.  They hallooed again, and called their two comrades by their
names a great many times; but no answer.  After some time we could see
them, by the little light there was, run about, wringing their hands like
men in despair, and sometimes they would go and sit down in the boat to
rest themselves: then come ashore again, and walk about again, and so the
same thing over again.  My men would fain have had me give them leave to
fall upon them at once in the dark; but I was willing to take them at
some advantage, so as to spare them, and kill as few of them as I could;
and especially I was unwilling to hazard the killing of any of our men,
knowing the others were very well armed.  I resolved to wait, to see if
they did not separate; and therefore, to make sure of them, I drew my
ambuscade nearer, and ordered Friday and the captain to creep upon their
hands and feet, as close to the ground as they could, that they might not
be discovered, and get as near them as they could possibly before they
offered to fire.

They had not been long in that posture when the boatswain, who was the
principal ringleader of the mutiny, and had now shown himself the most
dejected and dispirited of all the rest, came walking towards them, with
two more of the crew; the captain was so eager at having this principal
rogue so much in his power, that he could hardly have patience to let him
come so near as to be sure of him, for they only heard his tongue before:
but when they came nearer, the captain and Friday, starting up on their
feet, let fly at them.  The boatswain was killed upon the spot: the next
man was shot in the body, and fell just by him, though he did not die
till an hour or two after; and the third ran for it.  At the noise of the
fire I immediately advanced with my whole army, which was now eight men,
viz. myself, generalissimo; Friday, my lieutenant-general; the captain
and his two men, and the three prisoners of war whom we had trusted with
arms.  We came upon them, indeed, in the dark, so that they could not see
our number; and I made the man they had left in the boat, who was now one
of us, to call them by name, to try if I could bring them to a parley,
and so perhaps might reduce them to terms; which fell out just as we
desired: for indeed it was easy to think, as their condition then was,
they would be very willing to capitulate.  So he calls out as loud as he
could to one of them, “Tom Smith!  Tom Smith!”  Tom Smith answered
immediately, “Is that Robinson?” for it seems he knew the voice.  The
other answered, “Ay, ay; for God’s sake, Tom Smith, throw down your arms
and yield, or you are all dead men this moment.”  “Who must we yield to?
Where are they?” says Smith again.  “Here they are,” says he; “here’s our
captain and fifty men with him, have been hunting you these two hours;
the boatswain is killed; Will Fry is wounded, and I am a prisoner; and if
you do not yield you are all lost.”  “Will they give us quarter, then?”
says Tom Smith, “and we will yield.”  “I’ll go and ask, if you promise to
yield,” said Robinson: so he asked the captain, and the captain himself
then calls out, “You, Smith, you know my voice; if you lay down your arms
immediately and submit, you shall have your lives, all but Will Atkins.”

Upon this Will Atkins cried out, “For God’s sake, captain, give me
quarter; what have I done?  They have all been as bad as I:” which, by
the way, was not true; for it seems this Will Atkins was the first man
that laid hold of the captain when they first mutinied, and used him
barbarously in tying his hands and giving him injurious language.
However, the captain told him he must lay down his arms at discretion,
and trust to the governor’s mercy: by which he meant me, for they all
called me governor.  In a word, they all laid down their arms and begged
their lives; and I sent the man that had parleyed with them, and two
more, who bound them all; and then my great army of fifty men, which,
with those three, were in all but eight, came up and seized upon them,
and upon their boat; only that I kept myself and one more out of sight
for reasons of state.

Our next work was to repair the boat, and think of seizing the ship: and
as for the captain, now he had leisure to parley with them, he
expostulated with them upon the villainy of their practices with him, and
upon the further wickedness of their design, and how certainly it must
bring them to misery and distress in the end, and perhaps to the gallows.
They all appeared very penitent, and begged hard for their lives.  As for
that, he told them they were not his prisoners, but the commander’s of
the island; that they thought they had set him on shore in a barren,
uninhabited island; but it had pleased God so to direct them that it was
inhabited, and that the governor was an Englishman; that he might hang
them all there, if he pleased; but as he had given them all quarter, he
supposed he would send them to England, to be dealt with there as justice
required, except Atkins, whom he was commanded by the governor to advise
to prepare for death, for that he would be hanged in the morning.

Though this was all but a fiction of his own, yet it had its desired
effect; Atkins fell upon his knees to beg the captain to intercede with
the governor for his life; and all the rest begged of him, for God’s
sake, that they might not be sent to England.

It now occurred to me that the time of our deliverance was come, and that
it would be a most easy thing to bring these fellows in to be hearty in
getting possession of the ship; so I retired in the dark from them, that
they might not see what kind of a governor they had, and called the
captain to me; when I called, at a good distance, one of the men was
ordered to speak again, and say to the captain, “Captain, the commander
calls for you;” and presently the captain replied, “Tell his excellency I
am just coming.”  This more perfectly amazed them, and they all believed
that the commander was just by, with his fifty men.  Upon the captain
coming to me, I told him my project for seizing the ship, which he liked
wonderfully well, and resolved to put it in execution the next morning.
But, in order to execute it with more art, and to be secure of success, I
told him we must divide the prisoners, and that he should go and take
Atkins, and two more of the worst of them, and send them pinioned to the
cave where the others lay.  This was committed to Friday and the two men
who came on shore with the captain.  They conveyed them to the cave as to
a prison: and it was, indeed, a dismal place, especially to men in their
condition.  The others I ordered to my bower, as I called it, of which I
have given a full description: and as it was fenced in, and they
pinioned, the place was secure enough, considering they were upon their
behaviour.

To these in the morning I sent the captain, who was to enter into a
parley with them; in a word, to try them, and tell me whether he thought
they might be trusted or not to go on board and surprise the ship.  He
talked to them of the injury done him, of the condition they were brought
to, and that though the governor had given them quarter for their lives
as to the present action, yet that if they were sent to England they
would all be hanged in chains; but that if they would join in so just an
attempt as to recover the ship, he would have the governor’s engagement
for their pardon.

Any one may guess how readily such a proposal would be accepted by men in
their condition; they fell down on their knees to the captain, and
promised, with the deepest imprecations, that they would be faithful to
him to the last drop, and that they should owe their lives to him, and
would go with him all over the world; that they would own him as a father
to them as long as they lived.  “Well,” says the captain, “I must go and
tell the governor what you say, and see what I can do to bring him to
consent to it.”  So he brought me an account of the temper he found them
in, and that he verily believed they would be faithful.  However, that we
might be very secure, I told him he should go back again and choose out
those five, and tell them, that they might see he did not want men, that
he would take out those five to be his assistants, and that the governor
would keep the other two, and the three that were sent prisoners to the
castle (my cave), as hostages for the fidelity of those five; and that if
they proved unfaithful in the execution, the five hostages should be
hanged in chains alive on the shore.  This looked severe, and convinced
them that the governor was in earnest; however, they had no way left them
but to accept it; and it was now the business of the prisoners, as much
as of the captain, to persuade the other five to do their duty.

Our strength was now thus ordered for the expedition: first, the captain,
his mate, and passenger; second, the two prisoners of the first gang, to
whom, having their character from the captain, I had given their liberty,
and trusted them with arms; third, the other two that I had kept till now
in my bower, pinioned, but on the captain’s motion had now released;
fourth, these five released at last; so that there were twelve in all,
besides five we kept prisoners in the cave for hostages.

I asked the captain if he was willing to venture with these hands on
board the ship; but as for me and my man Friday, I did not think it was
proper for us to stir, having seven men left behind; and it was
employment enough for us to keep them asunder, and supply them with
victuals.  As to the five in the cave, I resolved to keep them fast, but
Friday went in twice a day to them, to supply them with necessaries; and
I made the other two carry provisions to a certain distance, where Friday
was to take them.

When I showed myself to the two hostages, it was with the captain, who
told them I was the person the governor had ordered to look after them;
and that it was the governor’s pleasure they should not stir anywhere but
by my direction; that if they did, they would be fetched into the castle,
and be laid in irons: so that as we never suffered them to see me as
governor, I now appeared as another person, and spoke of the governor,
the garrison, the castle, and the like, upon all occasions.

The captain now had no difficulty before him, but to furnish his two
boats, stop the breach of one, and man them.  He made his passenger
captain of one, with four of the men; and himself, his mate, and five
more, went in the other; and they contrived their business very well, for
they came up to the ship about midnight.  As soon as they came within
call of the ship, he made Robinson hail them, and tell them they had
brought off the men and the boat, but that it was a long time before they
had found them, and the like, holding them in a chat till they came to
the ship’s side; when the captain and the mate entering first with their
arms, immediately knocked down the second mate and carpenter with the
butt-end of their muskets, being very faithfully seconded by their men;
they secured all the rest that were upon the main and quarter decks, and
began to fasten the hatches, to keep them down that were below; when the
other boat and their men, entering at the forechains, secured the
forecastle of the ship, and the scuttle which went down into the
cook-room, making three men they found there prisoners.  When this was
done, and all safe upon deck, the captain ordered the mate, with three
men, to break into the round-house, where the new rebel captain lay, who,
having taken the alarm, had got up, and with two men and a boy had got
firearms in their hands; and when the mate, with a crow, split open the
door, the new captain and his men fired boldly among them, and wounded
the mate with a musket ball, which broke his arm, and wounded two more of
the men, but killed nobody.  The mate, calling for help, rushed, however,
into the round-house, wounded as he was, and, with his pistol, shot the
new captain through the head, the bullet entering at his mouth, and came
out again behind one of his ears, so that he never spoke a word more:
upon which the rest yielded, and the ship was taken effectually, without
any more lives lost.

As soon as the ship was thus secured, the captain ordered seven guns to
be fired, which was the signal agreed upon with me to give me notice of
his success, which, you may be sure, I was very glad to hear, having sat
watching upon the shore for it till near two o’clock in the morning.
Having thus heard the signal plainly, I laid me down; and it having been
a day of great fatigue to me, I slept very sound, till I was surprised
with the noise of a gun; and presently starting up, I heard a man call me
by the name of “Governor!  Governor!” and presently I knew the captain’s
voice; when, climbing up to the top of the hill, there he stood, and,
pointing to the ship, he embraced me in his arms, “My dear friend and
deliverer,” says he, “there’s your ship; for she is all yours, and so are
we, and all that belong to her.”  I cast my eyes to the ship, and there
she rode, within little more than half a mile of the shore; for they had
weighed her anchor as soon as they were masters of her, and, the weather
being fair, had brought her to an anchor just against the mouth of the
little creek; and the tide being up, the captain had brought the pinnace
in near the place where I had first landed my rafts, and so landed just
at my door.  I was at first ready to sink down with the surprise; for I
saw my deliverance, indeed, visibly put into my hands, all things easy,
and a large ship just ready to carry me away whither I pleased to go.  At
first, for some time, I was not able to answer him one word; but as he
had taken me in his arms I held fast by him, or I should have fallen to
the ground.  He perceived the surprise, and immediately pulled a bottle
out of his pocket and gave me a dram of cordial, which he had brought on
purpose for me.  After I had drunk it, I sat down upon the ground; and
though it brought me to myself, yet it was a good while before I could
speak a word to him.  All this time the poor man was in as great an
ecstasy as I, only not under any surprise as I was; and he said a
thousand kind and tender things to me, to compose and bring me to myself;
but such was the flood of joy in my breast, that it put all my spirits
into confusion: at last it broke out into tears, and in a little while
after I recovered my speech; I then took my turn, and embraced him as my
deliverer, and we rejoiced together.  I told him I looked upon him as a
man sent by Heaven to deliver me, and that the whole transaction seemed
to be a chain of wonders; that such things as these were the testimonies
we had of a secret hand of Providence governing the world, and an
evidence that the eye of an infinite Power could search into the remotest
corner of the world, and send help to the miserable whenever He pleased.
I forgot not to lift up my heart in thankfulness to Heaven; and what
heart could forbear to bless Him, who had not only in a miraculous manner
provided for me in such a wilderness, and in such a desolate condition,
but from whom every deliverance must always be acknowledged to proceed.

When we had talked a while, the captain told me he had brought me some
little refreshment, such as the ship afforded, and such as the wretches
that had been so long his masters had not plundered him of.  Upon this,
he called aloud to the boat, and bade his men bring the things ashore
that were for the governor; and, indeed, it was a present as if I had
been one that was not to be carried away with them, but as if I had been
to dwell upon the island still.  First, he had brought me a case of
bottles full of excellent cordial waters, six large bottles of Madeira
wine (the bottles held two quarts each), two pounds of excellent good
tobacco, twelve good pieces of the ship’s beef, and six pieces of pork,
with a bag of peas, and about a hundred-weight of biscuit; he also
brought me a box of sugar, a box of flour, a bag full of lemons, and two
bottles of lime-juice, and abundance of other things.  But besides these,
and what was a thousand times more useful to me, he brought me six new
clean shirts, six very good neckcloths, two pair of gloves, one pair of
shoes, a hat, and one pair of stockings, with a very good suit of clothes
of his own, which had been worn but very little: in a word, he clothed me
from head to foot.  It was a very kind and agreeable present, as any one
may imagine, to one in my circumstances, but never was anything in the
world of that kind so unpleasant, awkward, and uneasy as it was to me to
wear such clothes at first.

After these ceremonies were past, and after all his good things were
brought into my little apartment, we began to consult what was to be done
with the prisoners we had; for it was worth considering whether we might
venture to take them with us or no, especially two of them, whom he knew
to be incorrigible and refractory to the last degree; and the captain
said he knew they were such rogues that there was no obliging them, and
if he did carry them away, it must be in irons, as malefactors, to be
delivered over to justice at the first English colony he could come to;
and I found that the captain himself was very anxious about it.  Upon
this, I told him that, if he desired it, I would undertake to bring the
two men he spoke of to make it their own request that he should leave
them upon the island.  “I should be very glad of that,” says the captain,
“with all my heart.”  “Well,” says I, “I will send for them up and talk
with them for you.”  So I caused Friday and the two hostages, for they
were now discharged, their comrades having performed their promise; I
say, I caused them to go to the cave, and bring up the five men, pinioned
as they were, to the bower, and keep them there till I came.  After some
time, I came thither dressed in my new habit; and now I was called
governor again.  Being all met, and the captain with me, I caused the men
to be brought before me, and I told them I had got a full account of
their villainous behaviour to the captain, and how they had run away with
the ship, and were preparing to commit further robberies, but that
Providence had ensnared them in their own ways, and that they were fallen
into the pit which they had dug for others.  I let them know that by my
direction the ship had been seized; that she lay now in the road; and
they might see by-and-by that their new captain had received the reward
of his villainy, and that they would see him hanging at the yard-arm;
that, as to them, I wanted to know what they had to say why I should not
execute them as pirates taken in the fact, as by my commission they could
not doubt but I had authority so to do.

One of them answered in the name of the rest, that they had nothing to
say but this, that when they were taken the captain promised them their
lives, and they humbly implored my mercy.  But I told them I knew not
what mercy to show them; for as for myself, I had resolved to quit the
island with all my men, and had taken passage with the captain to go to
England; and as for the captain, he could not carry them to England other
than as prisoners in irons, to be tried for mutiny and running away with
the ship; the consequence of which, they must needs know, would be the
gallows; so that I could not tell what was best for them, unless they had
a mind to take their fate in the island.  If they desired that, as I had
liberty to leave the island, I had some inclination to give them their
lives, if they thought they could shift on shore.  They seemed very
thankful for it, and said they would much rather venture to stay there
than be carried to England to be hanged.  So I left it on that issue.

However, the captain seemed to make some difficulty of it, as if he durst
not leave them there.  Upon this I seemed a little angry with the
captain, and told him that they were my prisoners, not his; and that
seeing I had offered them so much favour, I would be as good as my word;
and that if he did not think fit to consent to it I would set them at
liberty, as I found them: and if he did not like it he might take them
again if he could catch them.  Upon this they appeared very thankful, and
I accordingly set them at liberty, and bade them retire into the woods,
to the place whence they came, and I would leave them some firearms, some
ammunition, and some directions how they should live very well if they
thought fit.  Upon this I prepared to go on board the ship; but told the
captain I would stay that night to prepare my things, and desired him to
go on board in the meantime, and keep all right in the ship, and send the
boat on shore next day for me; ordering him, at all events, to cause the
new captain, who was killed, to be hanged at the yard-arm, that these men
might see him.

When the captain was gone I sent for the men up to me to my apartment,
and entered seriously into discourse with them on their circumstances.  I
told them I thought they had made a right choice; that if the captain had
carried them away they would certainly be hanged.  I showed them the new
captain hanging at the yard-arm of the ship, and told them they had
nothing less to expect.

When they had all declared their willingness to stay, I then told them I
would let them into the story of my living there, and put them into the
way of making it easy to them.  Accordingly, I gave them the whole
history of the place, and of my coming to it; showed them my
fortifications, the way I made my bread, planted my corn, cured my
grapes; and, in a word, all that was necessary to make them easy.  I told
them the story also of the seventeen Spaniards that were to be expected,
for whom I left a letter, and made them promise to treat them in common
with themselves.  Here it may be noted that the captain, who had ink on
board, was greatly surprised that I never hit upon a way of making ink of
charcoal and water, or of something else, as I had done things much more
difficult.

I left them my firearms—viz. five muskets, three fowling-pieces, and
three swords.  I had above a barrel and a half of powder left; for after
the first year or two I used but little, and wasted none.  I gave them a
description of the way I managed the goats, and directions to milk and
fatten them, and to make both butter and cheese.  In a word, I gave them
every part of my own story; and told them I should prevail with the
captain to leave them two barrels of gunpowder more, and some
garden-seeds, which I told them I would have been very glad of.  Also, I
gave them the bag of peas which the captain had brought me to eat, and
bade them be sure to sow and increase them.




CHAPTER XIX—RETURN TO ENGLAND


Having done all this I left them the next day, and went on board the
ship.  We prepared immediately to sail, but did not weigh that night.
The next morning early, two of the five men came swimming to the ship’s
side, and making the most lamentable complaint of the other three, begged
to be taken into the ship for God’s sake, for they should be murdered,
and begged the captain to take them on board, though he hanged them
immediately.  Upon this the captain pretended to have no power without
me; but after some difficulty, and after their solemn promises of
amendment, they were taken on board, and were, some time after, soundly
whipped and pickled; after which they proved very honest and quiet
fellows.

Some time after this, the boat was ordered on shore, the tide being up,
with the things promised to the men; to which the captain, at my
intercession, caused their chests and clothes to be added, which they
took, and were very thankful for.  I also encouraged them, by telling
them that if it lay in my power to send any vessel to take them in, I
would not forget them.

When I took leave of this island, I carried on board, for relics, the
great goat-skin cap I had made, my umbrella, and one of my parrots; also,
I forgot not to take the money I formerly mentioned, which had lain by me
so long useless that it was grown rusty or tarnished, and could hardly
pass for silver till it had been a little rubbed and handled, as also the
money I found in the wreck of the Spanish ship.  And thus I left the
island, the 19th of December, as I found by the ship’s account, in the
year 1686, after I had been upon it eight-and-twenty years, two months,
and nineteen days; being delivered from this second captivity the same
day of the month that I first made my escape in the long-boat from among
the Moors of Sallee.  In this vessel, after a long voyage, I arrived in
England the 11th of June, in the year 1687, having been thirty-five years
absent.

When I came to England I was as perfect a stranger to all the world as if
I had never been known there.  My benefactor and faithful steward, whom I
had left my money in trust with, was alive, but had had great misfortunes
in the world; was become a widow the second time, and very low in the
world.  I made her very easy as to what she owed me, assuring her I would
give her no trouble; but, on the contrary, in gratitude for her former
care and faithfulness to me, I relieved her as my little stock would
afford; which at that time would, indeed, allow me to do but little for
her; but I assured her I would never forget her former kindness to me;
nor did I forget her when I had sufficient to help her, as shall be
observed in its proper place.  I went down afterwards into Yorkshire; but
my father was dead, and my mother and all the family extinct, except that
I found two sisters, and two of the children of one of my brothers; and
as I had been long ago given over for dead, there had been no provision
made for me; so that, in a word, I found nothing to relieve or assist me;
and that the little money I had would not do much for me as to settling
in the world.

I met with one piece of gratitude indeed, which I did not expect; and
this was, that the master of the ship, whom I had so happily delivered,
and by the same means saved the ship and cargo, having given a very
handsome account to the owners of the manner how I had saved the lives of
the men and the ship, they invited me to meet them and some other
merchants concerned, and all together made me a very handsome compliment
upon the subject, and a present of almost £200 sterling.

But after making several reflections upon the circumstances of my life,
and how little way this would go towards settling me in the world, I
resolved to go to Lisbon, and see if I might not come at some information
of the state of my plantation in the Brazils, and of what was become of
my partner, who, I had reason to suppose, had some years past given me
over for dead.  With this view I took shipping for Lisbon, where I
arrived in April following, my man Friday accompanying me very honestly
in all these ramblings, and proving a most faithful servant upon all
occasions.  When I came to Lisbon, I found out, by inquiry, and to my
particular satisfaction, my old friend, the captain of the ship who first
took me up at sea off the shore of Africa.  He was now grown old, and had
left off going to sea, having put his son, who was far from a young man,
into his ship, and who still used the Brazil trade.  The old man did not
know me, and indeed I hardly knew him.  But I soon brought him to my
remembrance, and as soon brought myself to his remembrance, when I told
him who I was.

After some passionate expressions of the old acquaintance between us, I
inquired, you may be sure, after my plantation and my partner.  The old
man told me he had not been in the Brazils for about nine years; but that
he could assure me that when he came away my partner was living, but the
trustees whom I had joined with him to take cognisance of my part were
both dead: that, however, he believed I would have a very good account of
the improvement of the plantation; for that, upon the general belief of
my being cast away and drowned, my trustees had given in the account of
the produce of my part of the plantation to the procurator-fiscal, who
had appropriated it, in case I never came to claim it, one-third to the
king, and two-thirds to the monastery of St. Augustine, to be expended
for the benefit of the poor, and for the conversion of the Indians to the
Catholic faith: but that, if I appeared, or any one for me, to claim the
inheritance, it would be restored; only that the improvement, or annual
production, being distributed to charitable uses, could not be restored:
but he assured me that the steward of the king’s revenue from lands, and
the providore, or steward of the monastery, had taken great care all
along that the incumbent, that is to say my partner, gave every year a
faithful account of the produce, of which they had duly received my
moiety.  I asked him if he knew to what height of improvement he had
brought the plantation, and whether he thought it might be worth looking
after; or whether, on my going thither, I should meet with any
obstruction to my possessing my just right in the moiety.  He told me he
could not tell exactly to what degree the plantation was improved; but
this he knew, that my partner was grown exceeding rich upon the enjoying
his part of it; and that, to the best of his remembrance, he had heard
that the king’s third of my part, which was, it seems, granted away to
some other monastery or religious house, amounted to above two hundred
moidores a year: that as to my being restored to a quiet possession of
it, there was no question to be made of that, my partner being alive to
witness my title, and my name being also enrolled in the register of the
country; also he told me that the survivors of my two trustees were very
fair, honest people, and very wealthy; and he believed I would not only
have their assistance for putting me in possession, but would find a very
considerable sum of money in their hands for my account, being the
produce of the farm while their fathers held the trust, and before it was
given up, as above; which, as he remembered, was for about twelve years.

I showed myself a little concerned and uneasy at this account, and
inquired of the old captain how it came to pass that the trustees should
thus dispose of my effects, when he knew that I had made my will, and had
made him, the Portuguese captain, my universal heir, &c.

He told me that was true; but that as there was no proof of my being
dead, he could not act as executor until some certain account should come
of my death; and, besides, he was not willing to intermeddle with a thing
so remote: that it was true he had registered my will, and put in his
claim; and could he have given any account of my being dead or alive, he
would have acted by procuration, and taken possession of the ingenio (so
they call the sugar-house), and have given his son, who was now at the
Brazils, orders to do it.  “But,” says the old man, “I have one piece of
news to tell you, which perhaps may not be so acceptable to you as the
rest; and that is, believing you were lost, and all the world believing
so also, your partner and trustees did offer to account with me, in your
name, for the first six or eight years’ profits, which I received.  There
being at that time great disbursements for increasing the works, building
an ingenio, and buying slaves, it did not amount to near so much as
afterwards it produced; however,” says the old man, “I shall give you a
true account of what I have received in all, and how I have disposed of
it.”

After a few days’ further conference with this ancient friend, he brought
me an account of the first six years’ income of my plantation, signed by
my partner and the merchant-trustees, being always delivered in goods,
viz. tobacco in roll, and sugar in chests, besides rum, molasses, &c.,
which is the consequence of a sugar-work; and I found by this account,
that every year the income considerably increased; but, as above, the
disbursements being large, the sum at first was small: however, the old
man let me see that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores
of gold, besides sixty chests of sugar and fifteen double rolls of
tobacco, which were lost in his ship; he having been shipwrecked coming
home to Lisbon, about eleven years after my having the place.  The good
man then began to complain of his misfortunes, and how he had been
obliged to make use of my money to recover his losses, and buy him a
share in a new ship.  “However, my old friend,” says he, “you shall not
want a supply in your necessity; and as soon as my son returns you shall
be fully satisfied.”  Upon this he pulls out an old pouch, and gives me
one hundred and sixty Portugal moidores in gold; and giving the writings
of his title to the ship, which his son was gone to the Brazils in, of
which he was quarter-part owner, and his son another, he puts them both
into my hands for security of the rest.

I was too much moved with the honesty and kindness of the poor man to be
able to bear this; and remembering what he had done for me, how he had
taken me up at sea, and how generously he had used me on all occasions,
and particularly how sincere a friend he was now to me, I could hardly
refrain weeping at what he had said to me; therefore I asked him if his
circumstances admitted him to spare so much money at that time, and if it
would not straiten him?  He told me he could not say but it might
straiten him a little; but, however, it was my money, and I might want it
more than he.

Everything the good man said was full of affection, and I could hardly
refrain from tears while he spoke; in short, I took one hundred of the
moidores, and called for a pen and ink to give him a receipt for them:
then I returned him the rest, and told him if ever I had possession of
the plantation I would return the other to him also (as, indeed, I
afterwards did); and that as to the bill of sale of his part in his son’s
ship, I would not take it by any means; but that if I wanted the money, I
found he was honest enough to pay me; and if I did not, but came to
receive what he gave me reason to expect, I would never have a penny more
from him.

When this was past, the old man asked me if he should put me into a
method to make my claim to my plantation.  I told him I thought to go
over to it myself.  He said I might do so if I pleased, but that if I did
not, there were ways enough to secure my right, and immediately to
appropriate the profits to my use: and as there were ships in the river
of Lisbon just ready to go away to Brazil, he made me enter my name in a
public register, with his affidavit, affirming, upon oath, that I was
alive, and that I was the same person who took up the land for the
planting the said plantation at first.  This being regularly attested by
a notary, and a procuration affixed, he directed me to send it, with a
letter of his writing, to a merchant of his acquaintance at the place;
and then proposed my staying with him till an account came of the return.

Never was anything more honourable than the proceedings upon this
procuration; for in less than seven months I received a large packet from
the survivors of my trustees, the merchants, for whose account I went to
sea, in which were the following, particular letters and papers
enclosed:—

First, there was the account-current of the produce of my farm or
plantation, from the year when their fathers had balanced with my old
Portugal captain, being for six years; the balance appeared to be one
thousand one hundred and seventy-four moidores in my favour.

Secondly, there was the account of four years more, while they kept the
effects in their hands, before the government claimed the administration,
as being the effects of a person not to be found, which they called civil
death; and the balance of this, the value of the plantation increasing,
amounted to nineteen thousand four hundred and forty-six crusadoes, being
about three thousand two hundred and forty moidores.

Thirdly, there was the Prior of St. Augustine’s account, who had received
the profits for above fourteen years; but not being able to account for
what was disposed of by the hospital, very honestly declared he had eight
hundred and seventy-two moidores not distributed, which he acknowledged
to my account: as to the king’s part, that refunded nothing.

There was a letter of my partner’s, congratulating me very affectionately
upon my being alive, giving me an account how the estate was improved,
and what it produced a year; with the particulars of the number of
squares, or acres that it contained, how planted, how many slaves there
were upon it: and making two-and-twenty crosses for blessings, told me he
had said so many _Ave Marias_ to thank the Blessed Virgin that I was
alive; inviting me very passionately to come over and take possession of
my own, and in the meantime to give him orders to whom he should deliver
my effects if I did not come myself; concluding with a hearty tender of
his friendship, and that of his family; and sent me as a present seven
fine leopards’ skins, which he had, it seems, received from Africa, by
some other ship that he had sent thither, and which, it seems, had made a
better voyage than I.  He sent me also five chests of excellent
sweetmeats, and a hundred pieces of gold uncoined, not quite so large as
moidores.  By the same fleet my two merchant-trustees shipped me one
thousand two hundred chests of sugar, eight hundred rolls of tobacco, and
the rest of the whole account in gold.

I might well say now, indeed, that the latter end of Job was better than
the beginning.  It is impossible to express the flutterings of my very
heart when I found all my wealth about me; for as the Brazil ships come
all in fleets, the same ships which brought my letters brought my goods:
and the effects were safe in the river before the letters came to my
hand.  In a word, I turned pale, and grew sick; and, had not the old man
run and fetched me a cordial, I believe the sudden surprise of joy had
overset nature, and I had died upon the spot: nay, after that I continued
very ill, and was so some hours, till a physician being sent for, and
something of the real cause of my illness being known, he ordered me to
be let blood; after which I had relief, and grew well: but I verily
believe, if I had not been eased by a vent given in that manner to the
spirits, I should have died.

I was now master, all on a sudden, of above five thousand pounds sterling
in money, and had an estate, as I might well call it, in the Brazils, of
above a thousand pounds a year, as sure as an estate of lands in England:
and, in a word, I was in a condition which I scarce knew how to
understand, or how to compose myself for the enjoyment of it.  The first
thing I did was to recompense my original benefactor, my good old
captain, who had been first charitable to me in my distress, kind to me
in my beginning, and honest to me at the end.  I showed him all that was
sent to me; I told him that, next to the providence of Heaven, which
disposed all things, it was owing to him; and that it now lay on me to
reward him, which I would do a hundred-fold: so I first returned to him
the hundred moidores I had received of him; then I sent for a notary, and
caused him to draw up a general release or discharge from the four
hundred and seventy moidores, which he had acknowledged he owed me, in
the fullest and firmest manner possible.  After which I caused a
procuration to be drawn, empowering him to be the receiver of the annual
profits of my plantation: and appointing my partner to account with him,
and make the returns, by the usual fleets, to him in my name; and by a
clause in the end, made a grant of one hundred moidores a year to him
during his life, out of the effects, and fifty moidores a year to his son
after him, for his life: and thus I requited my old man.

I had now to consider which way to steer my course next, and what to do
with the estate that Providence had thus put into my hands; and, indeed,
I had more care upon my head now than I had in my state of life in the
island where I wanted nothing but what I had, and had nothing but what I
wanted; whereas I had now a great charge upon me, and my business was how
to secure it.  I had not a cave now to hide my money in, or a place where
it might lie without lock or key, till it grew mouldy and tarnished
before anybody would meddle with it; on the contrary, I knew not where to
put it, or whom to trust with it.  My old patron, the captain, indeed,
was honest, and that was the only refuge I had.  In the next place, my
interest in the Brazils seemed to summon me thither; but now I could not
tell how to think of going thither till I had settled my affairs, and
left my effects in some safe hands behind me.  At first I thought of my
old friend the widow, who I knew was honest, and would be just to me; but
then she was in years, and but poor, and, for aught I knew, might be in
debt: so that, in a word, I had no way but to go back to England myself
and take my effects with me.

It was some months, however, before I resolved upon this; and, therefore,
as I had rewarded the old captain fully, and to his satisfaction, who had
been my former benefactor, so I began to think of the poor widow, whose
husband had been my first benefactor, and she, while it was in her power,
my faithful steward and instructor.  So, the first thing I did, I got a
merchant in Lisbon to write to his correspondent in London, not only to
pay a bill, but to go find her out, and carry her, in money, a hundred
pounds from me, and to talk with her, and comfort her in her poverty, by
telling her she should, if I lived, have a further supply: at the same
time I sent my two sisters in the country a hundred pounds each, they
being, though not in want, yet not in very good circumstances; one having
been married and left a widow; and the other having a husband not so kind
to her as he should be.  But among all my relations or acquaintances I
could not yet pitch upon one to whom I durst commit the gross of my
stock, that I might go away to the Brazils, and leave things safe behind
me; and this greatly perplexed me.

I had once a mind to have gone to the Brazils and have settled myself
there, for I was, as it were, naturalised to the place; but I had some
little scruple in my mind about religion, which insensibly drew me back.
However, it was not religion that kept me from going there for the
present; and as I had made no scruple of being openly of the religion of
the country all the while I was among them, so neither did I yet; only
that, now and then, having of late thought more of it than formerly, when
I began to think of living and dying among them, I began to regret having
professed myself a Papist, and thought it might not be the best religion
to die with.

But, as I have said, this was not the main thing that kept me from going
to the Brazils, but that really I did not know with whom to leave my
effects behind me; so I resolved at last to go to England, where, if I
arrived, I concluded that I should make some acquaintance, or find some
relations, that would be faithful to me; and, accordingly, I prepared to
go to England with all my wealth.

In order to prepare things for my going home, I first (the Brazil fleet
being just going away) resolved to give answers suitable to the just and
faithful account of things I had from thence; and, first, to the Prior of
St. Augustine I wrote a letter full of thanks for his just dealings, and
the offer of the eight hundred and seventy-two moidores which were
undisposed of, which I desired might be given, five hundred to the
monastery, and three hundred and seventy-two to the poor, as the prior
should direct; desiring the good padre’s prayers for me, and the like.  I
wrote next a letter of thanks to my two trustees, with all the
acknowledgment that so much justice and honesty called for: as for
sending them any present, they were far above having any occasion of it.
Lastly, I wrote to my partner, acknowledging his industry in the
improving the plantation, and his integrity in increasing the stock of
the works; giving him instructions for his future government of my part,
according to the powers I had left with my old patron, to whom I desired
him to send whatever became due to me, till he should hear from me more
particularly; assuring him that it was my intention not only to come to
him, but to settle myself there for the remainder of my life.  To this I
added a very handsome present of some Italian silks for his wife and two
daughters, for such the captain’s son informed me he had; with two pieces
of fine English broadcloth, the best I could get in Lisbon, five pieces
of black baize, and some Flanders lace of a good value.

Having thus settled my affairs, sold my cargo, and turned all my effects
into good bills of exchange, my next difficulty was which way to go to
England: I had been accustomed enough to the sea, and yet I had a strange
aversion to go to England by the sea at that time, and yet I could give
no reason for it, yet the difficulty increased upon me so much, that
though I had once shipped my baggage in order to go, yet I altered my
mind, and that not once but two or three times.

It is true I had been very unfortunate by sea, and this might be one of
the reasons; but let no man slight the strong impulses of his own
thoughts in cases of such moment: two of the ships which I had singled
out to go in, I mean more particularly singled out than any other, having
put my things on board one of them, and in the other having agreed with
the captain; I say two of these ships miscarried.  One was taken by the
Algerines, and the other was lost on the Start, near Torbay, and all the
people drowned except three; so that in either of those vessels I had
been made miserable.

Having been thus harassed in my thoughts, my old pilot, to whom I
communicated everything, pressed me earnestly not to go by sea, but
either to go by land to the Groyne, and cross over the Bay of Biscay to
Rochelle, from whence it was but an easy and safe journey by land to
Paris, and so to Calais and Dover; or to go up to Madrid, and so all the
way by land through France.  In a word, I was so prepossessed against my
going by sea at all, except from Calais to Dover, that I resolved to
travel all the way by land; which, as I was not in haste, and did not
value the charge, was by much the pleasanter way: and to make it more so,
my old captain brought an English gentleman, the son of a merchant in
Lisbon, who was willing to travel with me; after which we picked up two
more English merchants also, and two young Portuguese gentlemen, the last
going to Paris only; so that in all there were six of us and five
servants; the two merchants and the two Portuguese, contenting themselves
with one servant between two, to save the charge; and as for me, I got an
English sailor to travel with me as a servant, besides my man Friday, who
was too much a stranger to be capable of supplying the place of a servant
on the road.

In this manner I set out from Lisbon; and our company being very well
mounted and armed, we made a little troop, whereof they did me the honour
to call me captain, as well because I was the oldest man, as because I
had two servants, and, indeed, was the origin of the whole journey.

As I have troubled you with none of my sea journals, so I shall trouble
you now with none of my land journals; but some adventures that happened
to us in this tedious and difficult journey I must not omit.

When we came to Madrid, we, being all of us strangers to Spain, were
willing to stay some time to see the court of Spain, and what was worth
observing; but it being the latter part of the summer, we hastened away,
and set out from Madrid about the middle of October; but when we came to
the edge of Navarre, we were alarmed, at several towns on the way, with
an account that so much snow was falling on the French side of the
mountains, that several travellers were obliged to come back to
Pampeluna, after having attempted at an extreme hazard to pass on.

When we came to Pampeluna itself, we found it so indeed; and to me, that
had been always used to a hot climate, and to countries where I could
scarce bear any clothes on, the cold was insufferable; nor, indeed, was
it more painful than surprising to come but ten days before out of Old
Castile, where the weather was not only warm but very hot, and
immediately to feel a wind from the Pyrenean Mountains so very keen, so
severely cold, as to be intolerable and to endanger benumbing and
perishing of our fingers and toes.

Poor Friday was really frightened when he saw the mountains all covered
with snow, and felt cold weather, which he had never seen or felt before
in his life.  To mend the matter, when we came to Pampeluna it continued
snowing with so much violence and so long, that the people said winter
was come before its time; and the roads, which were difficult before,
were now quite impassable; for, in a word, the snow lay in some places
too thick for us to travel, and being not hard frozen, as is the case in
the northern countries, there was no going without being in danger of
being buried alive every step.  We stayed no less than twenty days at
Pampeluna; when (seeing the winter coming on, and no likelihood of its
being better, for it was the severest winter all over Europe that had
been known in the memory of man) I proposed that we should go away to
Fontarabia, and there take shipping for Bordeaux, which was a very little
voyage.  But, while I was considering this, there came in four French
gentlemen, who, having been stopped on the French side of the passes, as
we were on the Spanish, had found out a guide, who, traversing the
country near the head of Languedoc, had brought them over the mountains
by such ways that they were not much incommoded with the snow; for where
they met with snow in any quantity, they said it was frozen hard enough
to bear them and their horses.  We sent for this guide, who told us he
would undertake to carry us the same way, with no hazard from the snow,
provided we were armed sufficiently to protect ourselves from wild
beasts; for, he said, in these great snows it was frequent for some
wolves to show themselves at the foot of the mountains, being made
ravenous for want of food, the ground being covered with snow.  We told
him we were well enough prepared for such creatures as they were, if he
would insure us from a kind of two-legged wolves, which we were told we
were in most danger from, especially on the French side of the mountains.
He satisfied us that there was no danger of that kind in the way that we
were to go; so we readily agreed to follow him, as did also twelve other
gentlemen with their servants, some French, some Spanish, who, as I said,
had attempted to go, and were obliged to come back again.

Accordingly, we set out from Pampeluna with our guide on the 15th of
November; and indeed I was surprised when, instead of going forward, he
came directly back with us on the same road that we came from Madrid,
about twenty miles; when, having passed two rivers, and come into the
plain country, we found ourselves in a warm climate again, where the
country was pleasant, and no snow to be seen; but, on a sudden, turning
to his left, he approached the mountains another way; and though it is
true the hills and precipices looked dreadful, yet he made so many tours,
such meanders, and led us by such winding ways, that we insensibly passed
the height of the mountains without being much encumbered with the snow;
and all on a sudden he showed us the pleasant and fruitful provinces of
Languedoc and Gascony, all green and flourishing, though at a great
distance, and we had some rough way to pass still.

We were a little uneasy, however, when we found it snowed one whole day
and a night so fast that we could not travel; but he bid us be easy; we
should soon be past it all: we found, indeed, that we began to descend
every day, and to come more north than before; and so, depending upon our
guide, we went on.

It was about two hours before night when, our guide being something
before us, and not just in sight, out rushed three monstrous wolves, and
after them a bear, from a hollow way adjoining to a thick wood; two of
the wolves made at the guide, and had he been far before us, he would
have been devoured before we could have helped him; one of them fastened
upon his horse, and the other attacked the man with such violence, that
he had not time, or presence of mind enough, to draw his pistol, but
hallooed and cried out to us most lustily.  My man Friday being next me,
I bade him ride up and see what was the matter.  As soon as Friday came
in sight of the man, he hallooed out as loud as the other, “O master! O
master!” but like a bold fellow, rode directly up to the poor man, and
with his pistol shot the wolf in the head that attacked him.

It was happy for the poor man that it was my man Friday; for, having been
used to such creatures in his country, he had no fear upon him, but went
close up to him and shot him; whereas, any other of us would have fired
at a farther distance, and have perhaps either missed the wolf or
endangered shooting the man.

But it was enough to have terrified a bolder man than I; and, indeed, it
alarmed all our company, when, with the noise of Friday’s pistol, we
heard on both sides the most dismal howling of wolves; and the noise,
redoubled by the echo of the mountains, appeared to us as if there had
been a prodigious number of them; and perhaps there was not such a few as
that we had no cause of apprehension: however, as Friday had killed this
wolf, the other that had fastened upon the horse left him immediately,
and fled, without doing him any damage, having happily fastened upon his
head, where the bosses of the bridle had stuck in his teeth.  But the man
was most hurt; for the raging creature had bit him twice, once in the
arm, and the other time a little above his knee; and though he had made
some defence, he was just tumbling down by the disorder of his horse,
when Friday came up and shot the wolf.

It is easy to suppose that at the noise of Friday’s pistol we all mended
our pace, and rode up as fast as the way, which was very difficult, would
give us leave, to see what was the matter.  As soon as we came clear of
the trees, which blinded us before, we saw clearly what had been the
case, and how Friday had disengaged the poor guide, though we did not
presently discern what kind of creature it was he had killed.




CHAPTER XX—FIGHT BETWEEN FRIDAY AND A BEAR


But never was a fight managed so hardily, and in such a surprising manner
as that which followed between Friday and the bear, which gave us all,
though at first we were surprised and afraid for him, the greatest
diversion imaginable.  As the bear is a heavy, clumsy creature, and does
not gallop as the wolf does, who is swift and light, so he has two
particular qualities, which generally are the rule of his actions; first,
as to men, who are not his proper prey (he does not usually attempt them,
except they first attack him, unless he be excessively hungry, which it
is probable might now be the case, the ground being covered with snow),
if you do not meddle with him, he will not meddle with you; but then you
must take care to be very civil to him, and give him the road, for he is
a very nice gentleman; he will not go a step out of his way for a prince;
nay, if you are really afraid, your best way is to look another way and
keep going on; for sometimes if you stop, and stand still, and look
steadfastly at him, he takes it for an affront; but if you throw or toss
anything at him, though it were but a bit of stick as big as your finger,
he thinks himself abused, and sets all other business aside to pursue his
revenge, and will have satisfaction in point of honour—that is his first
quality: the next is, if he be once affronted, he will never leave you,
night or day, till he has his revenge, but follows at a good round rate
till he overtm my heir, and if £10,000 be required to set him up, he shall
not want it. I was but his mother's servant when he was born, and I
mourned heartily for the disaster of the family, and I always said, if
ever I was worth anything in the world, I would take the child for my
own, and I'll be as good as my word now, though I did not then foresee
that it would be with me as it has been since." And so Amy told him a
long story how she was troubled for me, and what she would give to hear
whether I was dead or alive, and what circumstances I was in; that if
she could but find me, if I was ever so poor, she would take care of me,
and make a gentlewoman of me again.

He told her that, as to the child's mother, she had been reduced to the
last extremity, and was obliged (as he supposed she knew) to send the
children all among her husband's friends; and if it had not been for
him, they had all been sent to the parish; but that he obliged the other
relations to share the charge among them; that he had taken two, whereof
he had lost the eldest, who died of the smallpox, but that he had been
as careful of this as of his own, and had made very little difference in
their breeding up, only that when he came to put him out he thought it
was best for the boy to put him to a trade which he might set up in
without a stock, for otherwise his time would be lost; and that as to
his mother, he had never been able to hear one word of her, no, not
though he had made the utmost inquiry after her; that there went a
report that she had drowned herself, but that he could never meet with
anybody that could give him a certain account of it.

Amy counterfeited a cry for her poor mistress; told him she would give
anything in the world to see her, if she was alive; and a great deal
more such-like talk they had about that; then they returned to speak of
the boy.

He inquired of her why she did not seek after the child before, that he
might have been brought up from a younger age, suitable to what she
designed to do for him.

She told him she had been out of England, and was but newly returned
from the East Indies. That she had been out of England, and was but
newly returned, was true, but the latter was false, and was put in to
blind him, and provide against farther inquiries; for it was not a
strange thing for young women to go away poor to the East Indies, and
come home vastly rich. So she went on with directions about him, and
both agreed in this, that the boy should by no means be told what was
intended for him, but only that he should be taken home again to his
uncle's, that his uncle thought the trade too hard for him, and the
like.

About three days after this Amy goes again, and carried him the hundred
pounds she promised him, but then Amy made quite another figure than she
did before; for she went in my coach, with two footmen after her, and
dressed very fine also, with jewels and a gold watch; and there was
indeed no great difficulty to make Amy look like a lady, for she was a
very handsome, well-shaped woman, and genteel enough. The coachman and
servants were particularly ordered to show her the same respect as they
would to me, and to call her Madam Collins, if they were asked any
questions about her.

When the gentleman saw what a figure she made it added to the former
surprise, and he entertained her in the most respectful manner possible,
congratulated her advancement in fortune, and particularly rejoiced that
it should fall to the poor child's lot to be so provided for, contrary
to all expectation.

Well, Amy talked big, but very free and familiar, told them she had no
pride in her good fortune (and that was true enough, for, to give Amy
her due, she was far from it, and was as good-humoured a creature as
ever lived); that she was the same as ever; and that she always loved
this boy, and was resolved to do something extraordinary for him.

Then she pulled out her money, and paid him down a hundred and twenty
pounds, which, she said, she paid him that he might be sure he should
be no loser by taking him home again, and that she would come and see
him again, and talk farther about things with him, so that all might be
settled for him, in such a manner as accidents, such as mortality, or
anything else, should make no alteration to the child's prejudice.

At this meeting the uncle brought his wife out, a good, motherly,
comely, grave woman, who spoke very tenderly of the youth, and, as it
appeared, had been very good to him, though she had several children of
her own. After a long discourse, she put in a word of her own. "Madam,"
says she, "I am heartily glad of the good intentions you have for this
poor orphan, and I rejoice sincerely in it for his sake; but, madam, you
know, I suppose, that there are two sisters alive too; may we not speak
a word for them? Poor girls," says she, "they have not been so kindly
used as he has, and are turned out to the wide world."

"Where are they, madam?" says Amy.

"Poor creatures," says the gentlewoman, "they are out at service, nobody
knows where but themselves; their case is very hard."

"Well, madam," says Amy, "though if I could find them I would assist
them, yet my concern is for my boy, as I call him, and I will put him
into a condition to take care of his sisters."

"But, madam," says the good, compassionate creature, "he may not be so
charitable perhaps by his own inclination, for brothers are not
fathers, and they have been cruelly used already, poor girls; we have
often relieved them, both with victuals and clothes too, even while they
were pretended to be kept by their barbarous aunt."

"Well, madam," says Amy, "what can I do for them? They are gone, it
seems, and cannot be heard of. When I see them 'tis time enough."

She pressed Amy then to oblige their brother, out of the plentiful
fortune he was like to have, to do something for his sisters when he
should be able.

Amy spoke coldly of that still, but said she would consider of it; and
so they parted for that time. They had several meetings after this, for
Amy went to see her adopted son, and ordered his schooling, clothes, and
other things, but enjoined them not to tell the young man anything, but
that they thought the trade he was at too hard for him, and they would
keep him at home a little longer, and give him some schooling to fit him
for other business; and Amy appeared to him as she did before, only as
one that had known his mother and had some kindness for him.

Thus this matter passed on for near a twelvemonth, when it happened that
one of my maid-servants having asked Amy leave (for Amy was mistress of
the servants, and took and put out such as she pleased)--I say, having
asked leave to go into the city to see her friends, came home crying
bitterly, and in a most grievous agony she was, and continued so
several days till Amy, perceiving the excess, and that the maid would
certainly cry herself sick, she took an opportunity with her and
examined her about it.

The maid told her a long story, that she had been to see her brother,
the only brother she had in the world, and that she knew he was put out
apprentice to a ----; but there had come a lady in a coach to his uncle
----, who had brought him up, and made him take him home again; and so
the wench run on with the whole story just as 'tis told above, till she
came to that part that belonged to herself. "And there," says she, "I
had not let them know where I lived, and the lady would have taken me,
and, they say, would have provided for me too, as she has done for my
brother; but nobody could tell where to find me, and so I have lost it
all, and all the hopes of being anything but a poor servant all my
days;" and then the girl fell a-crying again.

Amy said, "What's all this story? Who could this lady be? It must be
some trick, sure." "No," she said, "it was not a trick, for she had made
them take her brother home from apprentice, and bought him new clothes,
and put him to have more learning; and the gentlewoman said she would
make him her heir."

"Her heir!" says Amy. "What does that amount to? It may be she had
nothing to leave him; she might make anybody her heir."

"No, no,"' says the girl; "she came in a fine coach and horses, and I
don't know how many footmen to attend her, and brought a great bag of
gold and gave it to my uncle ----, he that brought up my brother, to buy
him clothes and to pay for his schooling and board."

"He that brought up your brother?" says Amy. "Why, did not he bring you
up too as well as your brother? Pray who brought you up, then?"

Here the poor girl told a melancholy story, how an aunt had brought up
her and her sister, and how barbarously she had used them, as we have
heard.

By this time Amy had her head full enough, and her heart too, and did
not know how to hold it, or what to do, for she was satisfied that this
was no other than my own daughter, for she told her all the history of
her father and mother, and how she was carried by their maid to her
aunt's door, just as is related in the beginning of my story.

Amy did not tell me this story for a great while, nor did she well know
what course to take in it; but as she had authority to manage everything
in the family, she took occasion some time after, without letting me
know anything of it, to find some fault with the maid and turn her away.

Her reasons were good, though at first I was not pleased when I heard of
it, but I was convinced afterwards that she was in the right, for if she
had told me of it I should have been in great perplexity between the
difficulty of concealing myself from my own child and the inconvenience
of having my way of living be known among my first husband's relations,
and even to my husband himself; for as to his being dead at Paris, Amy,
seeing me resolved against marrying any more, had told me that she had
formed that story only to make me easy when I was in Holland if anything
should offer to my liking.

However, I was too tender a mother still, notwithstanding what I had
done, to let this poor girl go about the world drudging, as it were, for
bread, and slaving at the fire and in the kitchen as a cook-maid;
besides, it came into my head that she might perhaps marry some poor
devil of a footman, or a coachman, or some such thing, and be undone
that way, or, which was worse, be drawn in to lie with some of that
coarse, cursed kind, and be with child, and be utterly ruined that way;
and in the midst of all my prosperity this gave me great uneasiness.

As to sending Amy to her, there was no doing that now, for, as she had
been servant in the house, she knew Amy as well as Amy knew me; and no
doubt, though I was much out of her sight, yet she might have had the
curiosity to have peeped at me, and seen me enough to know me again if I
had discovered myself to her; so that, in short, there was nothing to be
done that way.

However, Amy, a diligent indefatigable creature, found out another
woman, and gave her her errand, and sent her to the honest man's house
in Spitalfields, whither she supposed the girl would go after she was
out of her place; and bade her talk with her, and tell her at a distance
that as something had been done for her brother, so something would be
done for her too; and, that she should not be discouraged, she carried
her £20 to buy her clothes, and bid her not go to service any more, but
think of other things; that she should take a lodging in some good
family, and that she should soon hear farther.

The girl was overjoyed with this news, you may be sure, and at first a
little too much elevated with it, and dressed herself very handsomely
indeed, and as soon as she had done so came and paid a visit to Madam
Amy, to let her see how fine she was. Amy congratulated her, and wished
it might be all as she expected, but admonished her not to be elevated
with it too much; told her humility was the best ornament of a
gentlewoman, and a great deal of good advice she gave her, but
discovered nothing.

All this was acted in the first years of my setting up my new figure
here in town, and while the masks and balls were in agitation; and Amy
carried on the affair of setting out my son into the world, which we
were assisted in by the sage advice of my faithful counsellor, Sir
Robert Clayton, who procured us a master for him, by whom he was
afterwards sent abroad to Italy, as you shall hear in its place; and Amy
managed my daughter too very well, though by a third hand.

My amour with my Lord ---- began now to draw to an end, and indeed,
notwithstanding his money, it had lasted so long that I was much more
sick of his lordship than he could be of me. He grew old and fretful,
and captious, and I must add, which made the vice itself begin to grow
surfeiting and nauseous to me, he grew worse and wickeder the older he
grew, and that to such degree as is not fit to write of, and made me so
weary of him that upon one of his capricious humours, which he often
took occasion to trouble me with, I took occasion to be much less
complaisant to him than I used to be; and as I knew him to be hasty, I
first took care to put him into a little passion, and then to resent it,
and this brought us to words, in which I told him I thought he grew sick
of me; and he answered in a heat that truly so he was. I answered that I
found his lordship was endeavouring to make me sick too; that I had met
with several such rubs from him of late, and that he did not use me as
he used to do, and I begged his lordship he would make himself easy.
This I spoke with an air of coldness and indifference such as I knew he
could not bear; but I did not downright quarrel with him and tell him I
was sick of him too, and desire him to quit me, for I knew that would
come of itself; besides, I had received a great deal of handsome usage
from him, and I was loth to have the breach be on my side, that he might
not be able to say I was ungrateful.

[Illustration: THE AMOUR DRAWS TO AN END

_I told him I thought he grew sick of me; and he answered in a heat that
truly so he was_]

But he put the occasion into my hands, for he came no more to me for two
months; indeed I expected a fit of absence, for such I had had several
times before, but not for above a fortnight or three weeks at most;
but after I had stayed a month, which was longer than ever he kept away
yet, I took a new method with him, for I was resolved now it should be
in my power to continue or not, as I thought fit. At the end of a month,
therefore, I removed, and took lodgings at Kensington Gravel Pits, at
that part next to the road to Acton, and left nobody in my lodgings but
Amy and a footman, with proper instructions how to behave when his
lordship, being come to himself, should think fit to come again, which I
knew he would.

About the end of two months, he came in the dusk of the evening as
usual. The footman answered him, and told him his lady was not at home,
but there was Mrs. Amy above; so he did not order her to be called down,
but went upstairs into the dining-room, and Mrs. Amy came to him. He
asked where I was. "My lord," said she, "my mistress has been removed a
good while from hence, and lives at Kensington." "Ah, Mrs. Amy! how came
you to be here, then?" "My lord," said she, "we are here till the
quarter-day, because the goods are not removed, and to give answers if
any comes to ask for my lady." "Well, and what answer are you to give to
me?" "Indeed, my lord," says Amy, "I have no particular answer to your
lordship, but to tell you and everybody else where my lady lives, that
they may not think she's run away." "No, Mrs. Amy," says he, "I don't
think she's run away; but, indeed, I can't go after her so far as
that." Amy said nothing to that, but made a courtesy, and said she
believed I would be there again for a week or two in a little time. "How
little time, Mrs Amy?" says my lord. "She comes next Tuesday," says Amy.
"Very well," says my lord; "I'll call and see her then;" and so he went
away.

Accordingly I came on the Tuesday, and stayed a fortnight, but he came
not; so I went back to Kensington, and after that I had very few of his
lordship's visits, which I was very glad of, and in a little time after
was more glad of it than I was at first, and upon a far better account
too.

For now I began not to be sick of his lordship only, but really I began
to be sick of the vice; and as I had good leisure now to divert and
enjoy myself in the world as much as it was possible for any woman to do
that ever lived in it, so I found that my judgment began to prevail upon
me to fix my delight upon nobler objects than I had formerly done, and
the very beginning of this brought some just reflections upon me
relating to things past, and to the former manner of my living; and
though there was not the least hint in all this from what may be called
religion or conscience, and far from anything of repentance, or anything
that was akin to it, especially at first, yet the sense of things, and
the knowledge I had of the world, and the vast variety of scenes that I
had acted my part in, began to work upon my senses, and it came so very
strong upon my mind one morning when I had been lying awake some time
in my bed, as if somebody had asked me the question, What was I a whore
for now? It occurred naturally upon this inquiry, that at first I
yielded to the importunity of my circumstances, the misery of which the
devil dismally aggravated, to draw me to comply; for I confess I had
strong natural aversions to the crime at first, partly owing to a
virtuous education, and partly to a sense of religion; but the devil,
and that greater devil of poverty, prevailed; and the person who laid
siege to me did it in such an obliging, and I may almost say
irresistible, manner, all still managed by the evil spirit; for I must
be allowed to believe that he has a share in all such things, if not the
whole management of them. But, I say, it was carried on by that person
in such an irresistible manner that, as I said when I related the fact,
there was no withstanding it; these circumstances, I say, the devil
managed not only to bring me to comply, but he continued them as
arguments to fortify my mind against all reflection, and to keep me in
that horrid course I had engaged in, as if it were honest and lawful.

But not to dwell upon that now; this was a pretence, and here was
something to be said, though I acknowledge it ought not to have been
sufficient to me at all; but, I say, to leave that, all this was out of
doors; the devil himself could not form one argument, or put one reason
into my head now, that could serve for an answer--no, not so much as a
pretended answer to this question, why I should be a whore now.

It had for a while been a little kind of excuse to me that I was engaged
with this wicked old lord, and that I could not in honour forsake him;
but how foolish and absurd did it look to repeat the word "honour" on so
vile an occasion! as if a woman should prostitute her honour in point of
honour--horrid inconsistency! Honour called upon me to detest the crime
and the man too, and to have resisted all the attacks which, from the
beginning, had been made upon my virtue; and honour, had it been
consulted, would have preserved me honest from the beginning:

     "For 'honesty' and 'honour' are the same."

This, however, shows us with what faint excuses and with what trifles we
pretend to satisfy ourselves, and suppress the attempts of conscience,
in the pursuit of agreeable crime, and in the possessing those pleasures
which we are loth to part with.

But this objection would now serve no longer, for my lord had in some
sort broke his engagements (I won't call it honour again) with me, and
had so far slighted me as fairly to justify my entire quitting of him
now; and so, as the objection was fully answered, the question remained
still unanswered, Why am I a whore now? Nor indeed had I anything to say
for myself, even to myself; I could not without blushing, as wicked as I
was, answer that I loved it for the sake of the vice, and that I
delighted in being a whore, as such; I say, I could not say this, even
to myself, and all alone, nor indeed would it have been true. I was
never able, in justice and with truth, to say I was so wicked as that;
but as necessity first debauched me, and poverty made me a whore at the
beginning, so excess of avarice for getting money and excess of vanity
continued me in the crime, not being able to resist the flatteries of
great persons; being called the finest woman in France; being caressed
by a prince; and afterwards, I had pride enough to expect and folly
enough to believe, though indeed without ground, by a great monarch.
These were my baits, these the chains by which the devil held me bound,
and by which I was indeed too fast held for any reasoning that I was
then mistress of to deliver me from.

But this was all over now; avarice could have no pretence. I was out of
the reach of all that fate could be supposed to do to reduce me; now I
was so far from poor, or the danger of it, that I had £50,000 in my
pocket at least; nay, I had the income of £50,000, for I had £2500 a
year coming in upon very good land security, besides three or four
thousand pounds in money, which I kept by me for ordinary occasions,
and, besides, jewels, and plate, and goods which were worth near £5600
more; these put together, when I ruminated on it all in my thoughts, as
you may be sure I did often, added weight still to the question, as
above, and it sounded continually in my head, "What next? What am I a
whore for now?"

It is true this was, as I say, seldom out of my thoughts, but yet it
made no impressions upon me of that kind which might be expected from a
reflection of so important a nature, and which had so much of substance
and seriousness in it.

But, however, it was not without some little consequences, even at that
time, and which gave a little turn to my way of living at first, as you
shall hear in its place.

But one particular thing intervened besides this which gave me some
uneasiness at this time, and made way for other things that followed. I
have mentioned in several little digressions the concern I had upon me
for my children, and in what manner I had directed that affair; I must
go on a little with that part, in order to bring the subsequent parts of
my story together.

My boy, the only son I had left that I had a legal right to call "son,"
was, as I have said, rescued from the unhappy circumstances of being
apprentice to a mechanic, and was brought up upon a new foot; but though
this was infinitely to his advantage, yet it put him back near three
years in his coming into this world; for he had been near a year at the
drudgery he was first put to, and it took up two years more to form him
for what he had hopes given him he should hereafter be, so that he was
full nineteen years old, or rather twenty years, before he came to be
put out as I intended; at the end of which time I put him to a very
flourishing Italian merchant, and he again sent him to Messina, in the
island of Sicily; and a little before the juncture I am now speaking of
I had letters from him--that is to say, Mrs. Amy had letters from him,
intimating that he was out of his time, and that he had an opportunity
to be taken into an English house there, on very good terms, if his
support from hence might answer what he was bid to hope for; and so
begged that what would be done for him might be so ordered that he might
have it for his present advancement, referring for the particulars to
his master, the merchant in London, who he had been put apprentice to
here; who, to cut the story short, gave such a satisfactory account of
it, and of my young man, to my steady and faithful counsellor, Sir
Robert Clayton, that I made no scruple to pay £4000, which was £1000
more than he demanded, or rather proposed, that he might have
encouragement to enter into the world better than he expected.

His master remitted the money very faithfully to him; and finding, by
Sir Robert Clayton, that the young gentleman--for so he called him--was
well supported, wrote such letters on his account as gave him a credit
at Messina equal in value to the money itself.

I could not digest it very well that I should all this while conceal
myself thus from my own child, and make all this favour due, in his
opinion, to a stranger; and yet I could not find in my heart to let my
son know what a mother he had, and what a life she lived; when, at the
same time that he must think himself infinitely obliged to me, he must
be obliged, if he was a man of virtue, to hate his mother, and abhor the
way of living by which all the bounty he enjoyed was raised.

This is the reason of mentioning this part of my son's story, which is
otherwise no ways concerned in my history, but as it put me upon
thinking how to put an end to that wicked course I was in, that my own
child, when he should afterwards come to England in a good figure, and
with the appearance of a merchant, should not be ashamed to own me.

But there was another difficulty, which lay heavier upon me a great
deal, and that was my daughter, who, as before, I had relieved by the
hands of another instrument, which Amy had procured. The girl, as I have
mentioned, was directed to put herself into a good garb, take lodgings,
and entertain a maid to wait upon her, and to give herself some
breeding--that is to say, to learn to dance, and fit herself to appear
as a gentlewoman; being made to hope that she should, some time or
other, find that she should be put into a condition to support her
character, and to make herself amends for all her former troubles. She
was only charged not to be drawn into matrimony till she was secured of
a fortune that might assist to dispose of herself suitable not to what
she then was, but what she was to be.

The girl was too sensible of her circumstances not to give all possible
satisfaction of that kind, and indeed she was mistress of too much
understanding not to see how much she should be obliged to that part for
her own interest.

It was not long after this, but being well equipped, and in everything
well set out, as she was directed, she came, as I have related above,
and paid a visit to Mrs. Amy, and to tell her of her good fortune. Amy
pretended to be much surprised at the alteration, and overjoyed for her
sake, and began to treat her very well, entertained her handsomely, and
when she would have gone away, pretended to ask my leave, and sent my
coach home with her; and, in short, learning from her where she lodged,
which was in the city, Amy promised to return her visit, and did so;
and, in a word, Amy and Susan (for she was my own name) began an
intimate acquaintance together.

There was an inexpressible difficulty in the poor girl's way, or else I
should not have been able to have forborne discovering myself to her,
and this was, her having been a servant in my particular family; and I
could by no means think of ever letting the children know what a kind of
creature they owed their being to, or giving them an occasion to upbraid
their mother with her scandalous life, much less to justify the like
practice from my example.

Thus it was with me; and thus, no doubt, considering parents always find
it that their own children are a restraint to them in their worst
courses, when the sense of a superior power has not the same influence.
But of that hereafter.

There happened, however, one good circumstance in the case of this poor
girl, which brought about a discovery sooner than otherwise it would
have been, and it was thus. After she and Amy had been intimate for some
time, and had exchanged several visits, the girl, now grown a woman,
talking to Amy of the gay things that used to fall out when she was
servant in my family, spoke of it with a kind of concern that she could
not see (me) her lady; and at last she adds, "'Twas very strange,
madam," says she to Amy, "but though I lived near two years in the
house, I never saw my mistress in my life, except it was that public
night when she danced in the fine Turkish habit, and then she was so
disguised that I knew nothing of her afterwards."

Amy was glad to hear this, but as she was a cunning girl from the
beginning, she was not to be bit, and so she laid no stress upon that at
first, but gave me an account of it; and I must confess it gave me a
secret joy to think that I was not known to her, and that, by virtue of
that only accident, I might, when other circumstances made room for it,
discover myself to her, and let her know she had a mother in a condition
fit to be owned.

It was a dreadful restraint to me before, and this gave me some very sad
reflections, and made way for the great question I have mentioned above;
and by how much the circumstance was bitter to me, by so much the more
agreeable it was to understand that the girl had never seen me, and
consequently did not know me again if she was to be told who I was.

However, the next time she came to visit Amy, I was resolved to put it
to a trial, and to come into the room and let her see me, and to see by
that whether she knew me or not; but Amy put me by, lest indeed, as
there was reason enough to question, I should not be able to contain or
forbear discovering myself to her; so it went off for that time.

But both these circumstances, and that is the reason of mentioning them,
brought me to consider of the life I lived, and to resolve to put myself
into some figure of life in which I might not be scandalous to my own
family, and be afraid to make myself known to my own children, who were
my own flesh and blood.

There was another daughter I had, which, with all our inquiries, we
could not hear of, high nor low, for several years after the first. But
I return to my own story.

Being now in part removed from my old station, I seemed to be in a fair
way of retiring from my old acquaintances, and consequently from the
vile, abominable trade I had driven so long; so that the door seemed to
be, as it were, particularly open to my reformation, if I had any mind
to it in earnest; but, for all that, some of my old friends, as I had
used to call them, inquired me out, and came to visit me at Kensington,
and that more frequently than I wished they would do; but it being once
known where I was, there was no avoiding it, unless I would have
downright refused and affronted them; and I was not yet in earnest
enough with my resolutions to go that length.

The best of it was, my old lewd favourite, who I now heartily hated,
entirely dropped me. He came once to visit me, but I caused Amy to deny
me, and say I was gone out. She did it so oddly, too, that when his
lordship went away, he said coldly to her, "Well, well, Mrs. Amy, I find
your mistress does not desire to be seen; tell her I won't trouble her
any more," repeating the words "any more" two or three times over, just
at his going away.

I reflected a little on it at first as unkind to him, having had so many
considerable presents from him, but, as I have said, I was sick of him,
and that on some accounts which, if I could suffer myself to publish
them, would fully justify my conduct. But that part of the story will
not bear telling, so I must leave it, and proceed.

I had begun a little, as I have said above, to reflect upon my manner of
living, and to think of putting a new face upon it, and nothing moved me
to it more than the consideration of my having three children, who were
now grown up; and yet that while I was in that station of life I could
not converse with them or make myself known to them; and this gave me a
great deal of uneasiness. At last I entered into talk on this part of it
with my woman Amy.

We lived at Kensington, as I have said, and though I had done with my
old wicked l----, as above, yet I was frequently visited, as I said, by
some others; so that, in a word, I began to be known in the town, not by
name only, but by my character too, which was worse.

It was one morning when Amy was in bed with me, and I had some of my
dullest thoughts about me, that Amy, hearing me sigh pretty often, asked
me if I was not well. "Yes, Amy, I am well enough," says I, "but my mind
is oppressed with heavy thoughts, and has been so a good while;" and
then I told her how it grieved me that I could not make myself known to
my own children, or form any acquaintances in the world. "Why so?" says
Amy. "Why, prithee, Amy," says I, "what will my children say to
themselves, and to one another, when they find their mother, however
rich she may be, is at best but a whore, a common whore? And as for
acquaintance, prithee, Amy, what sober lady or what family of any
character will visit or be acquainted with a whore?"

"Why, all that's true, madam," says Amy; "but how can it be remedied
now?" "'Tis true, Amy," said I, "the thing cannot be remedied now, but
the scandal of it, I fancy, may be thrown off."

"Truly," says Amy, "I do not see how, unless you will go abroad again,
and live in some other nation where nobody has known us or seen us, so
that they cannot say they ever saw us before."

That very thought of Amy put what follows into my head, and I returned,
"Why, Amy," says I, "is it not possible for me to shift my being from
this part of the town and go and live in another part of the city, or
another part of the country, and be as entirely concealed as if I had
never been known?"

"Yes," says Amy, "I believe it might; but then you must put off all your
equipages and servants, coaches and horses, change your liveries--nay,
your own clothes, and, if it was possible, your very face."

"Well," says I, "and that's the way, Amy, and that I'll do, and that
forthwith; for I am not able to live in this manner any longer." Amy
came into this with a kind of pleasure particular to herself--that is to
say, with an eagerness not to be resisted; for Amy was apt to be
precipitant in her motions, and was for doing it immediately. "Well,"
says I, "Amy, as soon as you will; but what course must we take to do
it? We cannot put off servants, and coach and horses, and everything,
leave off housekeeping, and transform ourselves into a new shape all in
a moment; servants must have warning, and the goods must be sold off,
and a thousand things;" and this began to perplex us, and in particular
took us up two or three days' consideration.

At last Amy, who was a clever manager in such cases, came to me with a
scheme, as she called it. "I have found it out, madam," says she, "I
have found a scheme how you shall, if you have a mind to it, begin and
finish a perfect entire change of your figure and circumstances in one
day, and shall be as much unknown, madam, in twenty-four hours, as you
would be in so many years."

"Come, Amy," says I, "let us hear of it, for you please me mightily with
the thoughts of it." "Why, then," says Amy, "let me go into the city
this afternoon, and I'll inquire out some honest, plain sober family,
where I will take lodgings for you, as for a country gentlewoman that
desires to be in London for about half a year, and to board yourself and
a kinswoman--that is, half a servant, half a companion, meaning myself;
and so agree with them by the month. To this lodging (if I hit upon one
to your mind) you may go to-morrow morning in a hackney-coach, with
nobody but me, and leave such clothes and linen as you think fit, but,
to be sure, the plainest you have; and then you are removed at once; you
never need set your foot in this house again" (meaning where we then
were), "or see anybody belonging to it. In the meantime I'll let the
servants know that you are going over to Holland upon extraordinary
business, and will leave off your equipages, and so I'll give them
warning, or, if they will accept of it, give them a month's wages. Then
I'll sell off your furniture as well as I can. As to your coach, it is
but having it new painted and the lining changed, and getting new
harness and hammercloths, and you may keep it still or dispose of it as
you think fit. And only take care to let this lodging be in some remote
part of the town, and you may be as perfectly unknown as if you had
never been in England in your life."

This was Amy's scheme, and it pleased me so well that I resolved not
only to let her go, but was resolved to go with her myself; but Amy put
me off of that, because, she said, she should have occasion to hurry up
and down so long that if I was with her it would rather hinder than
further her, so I waived it.

In a word, Amy went, and was gone five long hours; but when she came
back I could see by her countenance that her success had been suitable
to her pains, for she came laughing and gaping. "O madam!" says she, "I
have pleased you to the life;" and with that she tells me how she had
fixed upon a house in a court in the Minories; that she was directed to
it merely by accident; that it was a female family, the master of the
house being gone to New England, and that the woman had four children,
kept two maids, and lived very handsomely, but wanted company to divert
her; and that on that very account she had agreed to take boarders.

Amy agreed for a good, handsome price, because she was resolved I should
be used well; so she bargained to give her £35 for the half-year, and
£50 if we took a maid, leaving that to my choice; and that we might be
satisfied we should meet with nothing very gay, the people were Quakers,
and I liked them the better.

I was so pleased that I resolved to go with Amy the next day to see the
lodgings, and to see the woman of the house, and see how I liked them;
but if I was pleased with the general, I was much more pleased with the
particulars, for the gentlewoman--I must call her so, though she was a
Quaker--was a most courteous, obliging, mannerly person, perfectly
well-bred and perfectly well-humoured, and, in short, the most agreeable
conversation that ever I met with; and, which was worth all, so grave,
and yet so pleasant and so merry, that 'tis scarcely possible for me to
express how I was pleased and delighted with her company; and
particularly, I was so pleased that I would go away no more; so I e'en
took up my lodging there the very first night.

In the meantime, though it took up Amy almost a month so entirely to put
off all the appearances of housekeeping, as above, it need take me up no
time to relate it; 'tis enough to say that Amy quitted all that part of
the world and came pack and package to me, and here we took up our
abode.

I was now in a perfect retreat indeed, remote from the eyes of all that
ever had seen me, and as much out of the way of being ever seen or heard
of by any of the gang that used to follow me as if I had been among the
mountains in Lancashire; for when did a blue garter or a coach-and-six
come into a little narrow passage in the Minories or Goodman's Fields?
And as there was no fear of them, so really I had no desire to see them,
or so much as to hear from them any more as long as I lived.

I seemed in a little hurry while Amy came and went so every day at
first, but when that was over I lived here perfectly retired, and with a
most pleasant and agreeable lady; I must call her so, for, though a
Quaker, she had a full share of good breeding, sufficient to her if she
had been a duchess; in a word, she was the most agreeable creature in
her conversation, as I said before, that ever I met with.

I pretended, after I had been there some time, to be extremely in love
with the dress of the Quakers, and this pleased her so much that she
would needs dress me up one day in a suit of her own clothes; but my
real design was to see whether it would pass upon me for a disguise.

Amy was struck with the novelty, though I had not mentioned my design to
her, and when the Quaker was gone out of the room says Amy, "I guess
your meaning; it is a perfect disguise to you. Why, you look quite
another body; I should not have known you myself. Nay," says Amy, "more
than that, it makes you look ten years younger than you did."

Nothing could please me better than that, and when Amy repeated it, I
was so fond of it that I asked my Quaker (I won't call her landlady;
'tis indeed too coarse a word for her, and she deserved a much
better)--I say, I asked her if she would sell it. I told her I was so
fond of it that I would give her enough to buy her a better suit. She
declined it at first, but I soon perceived that it was chiefly in good
manners, because I should not dishonour myself, as she called it, to put
on her old clothes; but if I pleased to accept of them, she would give
me them for my dressing-clothes, and go with me, and buy a suit for me
that might be better worth my wearing.

But as I conversed in a very frank, open manner with her, I bid her do
the like with me; that I made no scruples of such things, but that if
she would let me have them I would satisfy her. So she let me know what
they cost, and to make her amends I gave her three guineas more than
they cost her.

This good (though unhappy) Quaker had the misfortune to have had a bad
husband, and he was gone beyond sea. She had a good house, and well
furnished, and had some jointure of her own estate which supported her
and her children, so that she did not want; but she was not at all above
such a help as my being there was to her; so she was as glad of me as I
was of her.

However, as I knew there was no way to fix this new acquaintance like
making myself a friend to her, I began with making her some handsome
presents and the like to her children. And first, opening my bundles one
day in my chamber, I heard her in another room, and called her in with a
kind of familiar way. There I showed her some of my fine clothes, and
having among the rest of my things a piece of very fine new holland,
which I had bought a little before, worth about 9s. an ell, I pulled it
out: "Here, my friend," says I, "I will make you a present, if you will
accept of it;" and with that I laid the piece of Holland in her lap.

I could see she was surprised, and that she could hardly speak. "What
dost thou mean?" says she. "Indeed I cannot have the face to accept so
fine a present as this;" adding, "'Tis fit for thy own use, but 'tis
above my wear, indeed." I thought she had meant she must not wear it so
fine because she was a Quaker. So I returned, "Why, do not you Quakers
wear fine linen neither?" "Yes," says she, "we wear fine linen when we
can afford it, but this is too good for me." However, I made her take
it, and she was very thankful too. But my end was answered another way,
for by this I engaged her so, that as I found her a woman of
understanding, and of honesty too, I might, upon any occasion, have a
confidence in her, which was, indeed, what I very much wanted.

By accustoming myself to converse with her, I had not only learned to
dress like a Quaker, but so used myself to "thee" and "thou" that I
talked like a Quaker too, as readily and naturally as if I had been born
among them; and, in a word, I passed for a Quaker among all people that
did not know me. I went but little abroad, but I had been so used to a
coach that I knew not how well to go without one; besides, I thought it
would be a farther disguise to me, so I told my Quaker friend one day
that I thought I lived too close, that I wanted air. She proposed
taking a hackney-coach sometimes, or a boat; but I told her I had always
had a coach of my own till now, and I could find in my heart to have one
again.

She seemed to think it strange at first, considering how close I lived,
but had nothing to say when she found I did not value the expense; so,
in short, I resolved I would have a coach. When we came to talk of
equipages, she extolled the having all things plain. I said so too; so I
left it to her direction, and a coachmaker was sent for, and he provided
me a plain coach, no gilding or painting, lined with a light grey cloth,
and my coachman had a coat of the same, and no lace on his hat.

When all was ready I dressed myself in the dress I bought of her, and
said, "Come, I'll be a Quaker to-day, and you and I'll go abroad;" which
we did, and there was not a Quaker in the town looked less like a
counterfeit than I did. But all this was my particular plot, to be the
more completely concealed, and that I might depend upon being not known,
and yet need not be confined like a prisoner and be always in fear; so
that all the rest was grimace.

We lived here very easy and quiet, and yet I cannot say I was so in my
mind; I was like a fish out of water. I was as gay and as young in my
disposition as I was at five-and-twenty; and as I had always been
courted, flattered, and used to love it, so I missed it in my
conversation; and this put me many times upon looking back upon things
past.

I had very few moments in my life which, in their reflection, afforded
me anything but regret: but of all the foolish actions I had to look
back upon in my life, none looked so preposterous and so like
distraction, nor left so much melancholy on my mind, as my parting with
my friend, the merchant of Paris, and the refusing him upon such
honourable and just conditions as he had offered; and though on his just
(which I called unkind) rejecting my invitation to come to him again, I
had looked on him with some disgust, yet now my mind run upon him
continually, and the ridiculous conduct of my refusing him, and I could
never be satisfied about him. I flattered myself that if I could but see
him I could yet master him, and that he would presently forget all that
had passed that might be thought unkind; but as there was no room to
imagine anything like that to be possible, I threw those thoughts off
again as much as I could.

However, they continually returned, and I had no rest night or day for
thinking of him, who I had forgot above eleven years. I told Amy of it,
and we talked it over sometimes in bed, almost whole nights together. At
last Amy started a thing of her own head, which put it in a way of
management, though a wild one too. "You are so uneasy, madam," says she,
"about this Mr. ----, the merchant at Paris; come," says she, "if you'll
give me leave, I'll go over and see what's become of him."

"Not for ten thousand pounds," said I; "no, nor if you met him in the
street, not to offer to speak to him on my account." "No," says Amy, "I
would not speak to him at all; or if I did, I warrant you it shall not
look to be upon your account. I'll only inquire after him, and if he is
in being, you shall hear of him; if not, you shall hear of him still,
and that may be enough."

"Why," says I, "if you will promise me not to enter into anything
relating to me with him, nor to begin any discourse at all unless he
begins it with you, I could almost be persuaded to let you go and try."

Amy promised me all that I desired; and, in a word, to cut the story
short, I let her go, but tied her up to so many particulars that it was
almost impossible her going could signify anything; and had she intended
to observe them, she might as well have stayed at home as have gone, for
I charged her, if she came to see him, she should not so much as take
notice that she knew him again; and if he spoke to her, she should tell
him she was come away from me a great many years ago, and knew nothing
what was become of me; that she had been come over to France six years
ago, and was married there, and lived at Calais; or to that purpose.

Amy promised me nothing, indeed; for, as she said, it was impossible for
her to resolve what would be fit to do, or not to do, till she was there
upon the spot, and had found out the gentleman, or heard of him; but
that then, if I would trust her, as I had always done, she would answer
for it that she would do nothing but what should be for my interest,
and what she would hope I should be very well pleased with.

With this general commission, Amy, notwithstanding she had been so
frighted at the sea, ventured her carcass once more by water, and away
she goes to France. She had four articles of confidence in charge to
inquire after for me, and, as I found by her, she had one for herself--I
say, four for me, because, though her first and principal errand was to
inform myself of my Dutch merchant, yet I gave her in charge to inquire,
second, after my husband, who I left a trooper in the _gens d'armes_;
third, after that rogue of a Jew, whose very name I hated, and of whose
face I had such a frightful idea that Satan himself could not
counterfeit a worse; and, lastly, after my foreign prince. And she
discharged herself very well of them all, though not so successful as I
wished.

Amy had a very good passage over the sea, and I had a letter from her,
from Calais, in three days after she went from London. When she came to
Paris she wrote me an account, that as to her first and most important
inquiry, which was after the Dutch merchant, her account was, that he
had returned to Paris, lived three years there, and quitting that city,
went to live at Rouen; so away goes Amy for Rouen.

But as she was going to bespeak a place in the coach to Rouen, she meets
very accidentally in the street with her gentleman, as I called
him--that is to say, the Prince de ----'s gentleman, who had been her
favourite, as above.

You may be sure there were several other kind things happened between
Amy and him, as you shall hear afterwards; but the two main things were,
first, that Amy inquired about his lord, and had a full account of him,
of which presently; and, in the next place, telling him whither she was
going and for what, he bade her not go yet, for that he would have a
particular account of it the next day from a merchant that knew him;
and, accordingly, he brought her word the next day that he had been for
six years before that gone for Holland, and that he lived there still.

This, I say, was the first news from Amy for some time--I mean about my
merchant. In the meantime Amy, as I have said, inquired about the other
persons she had in her instructions. As for the prince, the gentleman
told her he was gone into Germany, where his estate lay, and that he
lived there; that he had made great inquiry after me; that he (his
gentleman) had made all the search he had been able for me, but that he
could not hear of me; that he believed, if his lord had known I had been
in England, he would have gone over to me; but that, after long inquiry,
he was obliged to give it over; but that he verily believed, if he could
have found me, he would have married me; and that he was extremely
concerned that he could hear nothing of me.

I was not at all satisfied with Amy's account, but ordered her to go to
Rouen herself, which she did, and there with much difficulty (the
person she was directed to being dead)--I say, with much difficulty she
came to be informed that my merchant had lived there two years, or
something more, but that, having met with a very great misfortune, he
had gone back to Holland, as the French merchant said, where he had
stayed two years; but with this addition, viz., that he came back again
to Rouen, and lived in good reputation there another year; and
afterwards he was gone to England, and that he lived in London. But Amy
could by no means learn how to write to him there, till, by great
accident, an old Dutch skipper, who had formerly served him, coming to
Rouen, Amy was told of it; and he told her that he lodged in St.
Laurence Pountney's Lane, in London, but was to be seen every day upon
the Exchange, in the French walk.

This, Amy thought, it was time enough to tell me of when she came over;
and, besides, she did not find this Dutch skipper till she had spent
four or five months and been again in Paris, and then come back to Rouen
for farther information. But in the meantime she wrote to me from Paris
that he was not to be found by any means; that he had been gone from
Paris seven or eight years; that she was told he had lived at Rouen, and
she was agoing thither to inquire, but that she had heard afterwards
that he was gone also from thence to Holland, so she did not go.

This, I say, was Amy's first account; and I, not satisfied with it, had
sent her an order to go to Rouen to inquire there also, as above.

While this was negotiating, and I received these accounts from Amy at
several times, a strange adventure happened to me which I must mention
just here. I had been abroad to take the air as usual with my Quaker, as
far as Epping Forest, and we were driving back towards London, when, on
the road between Bow and Mile End, two gentlemen on horseback came
riding by, having overtaken the coach and passed it, and went forwards
towards London.

They did not ride apace though they passed the coach, for we went very
softly; nor did they look into the coach at all, but rode side by side,
earnestly talking to one another and inclining their faces sideways a
little towards one another, he that went nearest the coach with his face
from it, and he that was farthest from the coach with his face towards
it, and passing in the very next tract to the coach, I could hear them
talk Dutch very distinctly. But it is impossible to describe the
confusion I was in when I plainly saw that the farthest of the two, him
whose face looked towards the coach, was my friend the Dutch merchant of
Paris.

If it had been possible to conceal my disorder from my friend the Quaker
I would have done it, but I found she was too well acquainted with such
things not to take the hint. "Dost thou understand Dutch?" said she.
"Why?" said I. "Why," says she, "it is easy to suppose that thou art a
little concerned at somewhat those men say; I suppose they are talking
of thee." "Indeed, my good friend," said I, "thou art mistaken this
time, for I know very well what they are talking of, but 'tis all about
ships and trading affairs." "Well," says she, "then one of them is a man
friend of thine, or somewhat is the case; for though thy tongue will not
confess it, thy face does."

I was going to have told a bold lie, and said I knew nothing of them;
but I found it was impossible to conceal it, so I said, "Indeed, I think
I know the farthest of them; but I have neither spoken to him or so much
as seen him for about eleven years." "Well, then," says she, "thou hast
seen him with more than common eyes when thou didst see him, or else
seeing him now would not be such a surprise to thee." "Indeed," said I,
"it is true I am a little surprised at seeing him just now, for I
thought he had been in quite another part of the world; and I can assure
you I never saw him in England in my life." "Well, then, it is the more
likely he is come over now on purpose to seek thee." "No, no," said I,
"knight-errantry is over; women are not so hard to come at that men
should not be able to please themselves without running from one kingdom
to another." "Well, well," says she, "I would have him see thee for all
that, as plainly as thou hast seen him." "No, but he shan't," says I,
"for I am sure he don't know me in this dress, and I'll take care he
shan't see my face, if I can help it;" so I held up my fan before my
face, and she saw me resolute in that, so she pressed me no farther.

We had several discourses upon the subject, but still I let her know I
was resolved he should not know me; but at last I confessed so much,
that though I would not let him know who I was or where I lived, I did
not care if I knew where he lived and how I might inquire about him. She
took the hint immediately, and her servant being behind the coach, she
called him to the coach-side and bade him keep his eye upon that
gentleman, and as soon as the coach came to the end of Whitechapel he
should get down and follow him closely, so as to see where he put up his
horse, and then to go into the inn and inquire, if he could, who he was
and where he lived.

The fellow followed diligently to the gate of an inn in Bishopsgate
Street, and seeing him go in, made no doubt but he had him fast; but was
confounded when, upon inquiry, he found the inn was a thoroughfare into
another street, and that the two gentlemen had only rode through the
inn, as the way to the street where they were going; and so, in short,
came back no wiser than he went.

My kind Quaker was more vexed at the disappointment, at least apparently
so, than I was; and asking the fellow if he was sure he knew the
gentleman again if he saw him, the fellow said he had followed him so
close and took so much notice of him, in order to do his errand as it
ought to be done, that he was very sure he should know him again; and
that, besides, he was sure he should know his horse.

This part was, indeed, likely enough; and the kind Quaker, without
telling me anything of the matter, caused her man to place himself just
at the corner of Whitechapel Church wall every Saturday in the
afternoon, that being the day when the citizens chiefly ride abroad to
take the air, and there to watch all the afternoon and look for him.

It was not till the fifth Saturday that her man came, with a great deal
of joy, and gave her an account that he had found out the gentleman;
that he was a Dutchman, but a French merchant; that he came from Rouen,
and his name was ----, and that he lodged at Mr. ----'s, on Laurence
Pountney's Hill. I was surprised, you may be sure, when she came and
told me one evening all the particulars, except that of having set her
man to watch. "I have found out thy Dutch friend," says she, "and can
tell thee how to find him too." I coloured again as red as fire. "Then
thou hast dealt with the evil one, friend," said I very gravely. "No,
no," says she, "I have no familiar; but I tell thee I have found him for
thee, and his name is So-and-so, and he lives as above recited."

I was surprised again at this, not being able to imagine how she should
come to know all this. However, to put me out of pain, she told me what
she had done. "Well," said I, "thou art very kind, but this is not
worth thy pains; for now I know it, 'tis only to satisfy my curiosity;
for I shall not send to him upon any account." "Be that as thou wilt,"
says she. "Besides," added she, "thou art in the right to say so to me,
for why should I be trusted with it? Though, if I were, I assure thee I
should not betray thee." "That's very kind," said I, "and I believe
thee; and assure thyself, if I do send to him, thou shalt know it, and
be trusted with it too."

During this interval of five weeks I suffered a hundred thousand
perplexities of mind. I was thoroughly convinced I was right as to the
person, that it was the man. I knew him so well, and saw him so plain, I
could not be deceived. I drove out again in the coach (on pretence of
air) almost every day in hopes of seeing him again, but was never so
lucky as to see him; and now I had made the discovery I was as far to
seek what measures to take as I was before.

To send to him, or speak to him first if I should see him, so as to be
known to him, that I resolved not to do, if I died for it. To watch him
about his lodging, that was as much below my spirit as the other. So
that, in a word, I was at a perfect loss how to act or what to do.

At length came Amy's letter, with the last account which she had at
Rouen from the Dutch skipper, which, confirming the other, left me out
of doubt that this was my man; but still no human invention could bring
me to the speech of him in such a manner as would suit with my
resolutions. For, after all, how did I know what his circumstances were?
whether married or single? And if he had a wife, I knew he was so honest
a man he would not so much as converse with me, or so much as know me if
he met me in the street.

In the next place, as he entirely neglected me, which, in short, is the
worst way of slighting a woman, and had given no answer to my letters, I
did not know but he might be the same man still; so I resolved that I
could do nothing in it unless some fairer opportunity presented, which
might make my way clearer to me; for I was determined he should have no
room to put any more slights upon me.

In these thoughts I passed away near three months; till at last, being
impatient, I resolved to send for Amy to come over, and tell her how
things stood, and that I would do nothing till she came. Amy, in answer,
sent me word she would come away with all speed, but begged of me that I
would enter into no engagement with him, or anybody, till she arrived;
but still keeping me in the dark as to the thing itself which she had to
say; at which I was heartily vexed, for many reasons.

But while all these things were transacting, and letters and answers
passed between Amy and I a little slower than usual, at which I was not
so well pleased as I used to be with Amy's despatch--I say, in this time
the following scene opened.

It was one afternoon, about four o'clock, my friendly Quaker and I
sitting in her chamber upstairs, and very cheerful, chatting together
(for she was the best company in the world), when somebody ringing
hastily at the door, and no servant just then in the way, she ran down
herself to the door, when a gentleman appears, with a footman attending,
and making some apologies, which she did not thoroughly understand, he
speaking but broken English, he asked to speak with me, by the very same
name that I went by in her house, which, by the way, was not the name
that he had known me by.

She, with very civil language, in her way, brought him into a very
handsome parlour below stairs, and said she would go and see whether the
person who lodged in her house owned that name, and he should hear
farther.

I was a little surprised, even before I knew anything of who it was, my
mind foreboding the thing as it happened (whence that arises let the
naturalists explain to us); but I was frighted and ready to die when my
Quaker came up all gay and crowing. "There," says she, "is the Dutch
French merchant come to see thee." I could not speak one word to her nor
stir off of my chair, but sat as motionless as a statue. She talked a
thousand pleasant things to me, but they made no impression on me. At
last she pulled me and teased me. "Come, come," says she, "be thyself,
and rouse up. I must go down again to him; what shall I say to him?"
"Say," said I, "that you have no such body in the house." "That I
cannot do," says she, "because it is not the truth. Besides, I have
owned thou art above. Come, come, go down with me." "Not for a thousand
guineas," said I. "Well," says she, "I'll go and tell him thou wilt come
quickly." So, without giving me time to answer her, away she goes.

A million of thoughts circulated in my head while she was gone, and what
to do I could not tell; I saw no remedy but I must speak with him, but
would have given £500 to have shunned it; yet had I shunned it, perhaps
then I would have given £500 again that I had seen him. Thus fluctuating
and unconcluding were my thoughts, what I so earnestly desired I
declined when it offered itself; and what now I pretended to decline was
nothing but what I had been at the expense of £40 or £50 to send Amy to
France for, and even without any view, or, indeed, any rational
expectation of bringing it to pass; and what for half a year before I
was so uneasy about that I could not be quiet night or day till Amy
proposed to go over to inquire after him. In short, my thoughts were all
confused and in the utmost disorder. I had once refused and rejected
him, and I repented it heartily; then I had taken ill his silence, and
in my mind rejected him again, but had repented that too. Now I had
stooped so low as to send after him into France, which if he had known,
perhaps, he had never come after me; and should I reject him a third
time! On the other hand, he had repented too, in his turn, perhaps, and
not knowing how I had acted, either in stooping to send in search after
him or in the wickeder part of my life, was come over hither to seek me
again; and I might take him, perhaps, with the same advantages as I
might have done before, and would I now be backward to see him! Well,
while I was in this hurry my friend the Quaker comes up again, and
perceiving the confusion I was in, she runs to her closet and fetched me
a little pleasant cordial; but I would not taste it. "Oh," says she, "I
understand thee. Be not uneasy; I'll give thee something shall take off
all the smell of it; if he kisses thee a thousand times he shall be no
wiser." I thought to myself, "Thou art perfectly acquainted with affairs
of this nature; I think you must govern me now;" so I began to incline
to go down with her. Upon that I took the cordial, and she gave me a
kind of spicy preserve after it, whose flavour was so strong, and yet so
deliciously pleasant, that it would cheat the nicest smelling, and it
left not the least taint of the cordial on the breath.

Well, after this, though with some hesitation still, I went down a pair
of back-stairs with her, and into a dining-room, next to the parlour in
which he was; but there I halted, and desired she would let me consider
of it a little. "Well, do so," says she, and left me with more readiness
than she did before. "Do consider, and I'll come to thee again."

Though I hung back with an awkwardness that was really unfeigned, yet
when she so readily left me I thought it was not so kind, and I began to
think she should have pressed me still on to it; so foolishly backward
are we to the thing which, of all the world, we most desire; mocking
ourselves with a feigned reluctance, when the negative would be death to
us. But she was too cunning for me; for while I, as it were, blamed her
in my mind for not carrying me to him, though, at the same time, I
appeared backward to see him, on a sudden she unlocks the folding-doors,
which looked into the next parlour, and throwing them open. "There,"
says she (ushering him in), "is the person who, I suppose, thou
inquirest for;" and the same moment, with a kind decency, she retired,
and that so swift that she would not give us leave hardly to know which
way she went.

I stood up, but was confounded with a sudden inquiry in my thoughts how
I should receive him, and with a resolution as swift as lightning, in
answer to it, said to myself, "It shall be coldly." So on a sudden I put
on an air of stiffness and ceremony, and held it for about two minutes;
but it was with great difficulty.

He restrained himself too, on the other hand, came towards me gravely,
and saluted me in form; but it was, it seems, upon his supposing the
Quaker was behind him, whereas she, as I said, understood things too
well, and had retired as if she had vanished, that we might have full
freedom; for, as she said afterwards, she supposed we had seen one
another before, though it might have been a great while ago.

Whatever stiffness I had put on my behaviour to him, I was surprised in
my mind, and angry at his, and began to wonder what kind of a
ceremonious meeting it was to be. However, after he perceived the woman
was gone he made a kind of a hesitation, looking a little round him.
"Indeed," said he, "I thought the gentlewoman was not withdrawn;" and
with that he took me in his arms and kissed me three or four times; but
I, that was prejudiced to the last degree with the coldness of his first
salutes, when I did not know the cause of it, could not be thoroughly
cleared of the prejudice though I did know the cause, and thought that
even his return, and taking me in his arms, did not seem to have the
same ardour with which he used to receive me, and this made me behave to
him awkwardly, and I know not how for a good while; but this by the way.

He began with a kind of an ecstasy upon the subject of his finding me
out; how it was possible that he should have been four years in England,
and had used all the ways imaginable, and could never so much as have
the least intimation of me, or of any one like me; and that it was now
above two years that he had despaired of it, and had given over all
inquiry; and that now he should chop upon me, as it were, unlooked and
unsought for.

I could easily have accounted for his not finding me if I had but set
down the detail of my real retirement; but I gave it a new, and indeed a
truly hypocritical turn. I told him that any one that knew the manner
of life I led might account for his not finding me; that the retreat I
had taken up would have rendered it a hundred thousand to one odds that
he ever found me at all; that, as I had abandoned all conversation,
taken up another name, lived remote from London, and had not preserved
one acquaintance in it, it was no wonder he had not met with me; that
even my dress would let him see that I did not desire to be known by
anybody.

Then he asked if I had not received some letters from him. I told him
no, he had not thought fit to give me the civility of an answer to the
last I wrote to him, and he could not suppose I should expect a return
after a silence in a case where I had laid myself so low and exposed
myself in a manner I had never been used to; that indeed I had never
sent for any letters after that to the place where I had ordered his to
be directed; and that, being so justly, as I thought, punished for my
weakness, I had nothing to do but to repent of being a fool, after I had
strictly adhered to a just principle before; that, however, as what I
did was rather from motions of gratitude than from real weakness,
however it might be construed by him, I had the satisfaction in myself
of having fully discharged the debt. I added, that I had not wanted
occasions of all the seeming advancements which the pretended felicity
of a marriage life was usually set off with, and might have been what I
desired not to name; but that, however low I had stooped to him, I had
maintained the dignity of female liberty against all the attacks either
of pride or avarice; and that I had been infinitely obliged to him for
giving me an opportunity to discharge the only obligation that
endangered me, without subjecting me to the consequence; and that I
hoped he was satisfied I had paid the debt by offering myself to be
chained, but was infinitely debtor to him another way for letting me
remain free.

He was so confounded at this discourse that he knew not what to say, and
for a good while he stood mute indeed; but recovering himself a little,
he said I run out into a discourse he hoped was over and forgotten, and
he did not intend to revive it; that he knew I had not had his letters,
for that, when he first came to England, he had been at the place to
which they were directed, and found them all lying there but one, and
that the people had not known how to deliver them; that he thought to
have had a direction there how to find me, but had the mortification to
be told that they did not so much as know who I was; that he was under a
great disappointment; and that I ought to know, in answer to all my
resentments, that he had done a long and, he hoped, a sufficient penance
for the slight that I had supposed he had put upon me; that it was true
(and I could not suppose any other) that upon the repulse I had given
them in a case so circumstanced as his was, and after such earnest
entreaties and such offers as he had made me, he went away with a mind
heartily grieved and full of resentment; that he had looked back on the
crime he had committed with some regret, but on the cruelty of my
treatment of the poor infant I went with at that time with the utmost
detestation, and that this made him unable to send an agreeable answer
to me; for which reason he had sent none at all for some time; but that
in about six or seven months, those resentments wearing off by the
return of his affection to me and his concern in the poor child ----.
There he stopped, and indeed tears stood in his eyes; while in a
parenthesis he only added, and to this minute he did not know whether it
was dead or alive. He then went on: Those resentments wearing off, he
sent me several letters--I think he said seven or eight--but received no
answer; that then his business obliging him to go to Holland, he came to
England, as in his way, but found, as above, that his letters had not
been called for, but that he left them at the house after paying the
postage of them; and going then back to France, he was yet uneasy, and
could not refrain the knight-errantry of coming to England again to seek
me, though he knew neither where or of who to inquire for me, being
disappointed in all his inquiries before; that he had yet taken up his
residence here, firmly believing that one time or other he should meet
me, or hear of me, and that some kind chance would at last throw him in
my way; that he had lived thus above four years, and though his hopes
were vanished, yet he had not any thoughts of removing any more in the
world, unless it should be at last, as it is with other old men, he
might have some inclination to go home to die in his own country, but
that he had not thought of it yet; that if I would consider all these
steps, I would find some reasons to forget his first resentments, and to
think that penance, as he called it, which he had undergone in search of
me an _amende honorable_, in reparation of the affront given to the
kindness of my letter of invitation; and that we might at last make
ourselves some satisfaction on both sides for the mortifications past.

I confess I could not hear all this without being moved very much, and
yet I continued a little stiff and formal too a good while. I told him
that before I could give him any reply to the rest of his discourse I
ought to give him the satisfaction of telling him that his son was
alive, and that indeed, since I saw him so concerned about it, and
mention it with such affection, I was sorry that I had not found out
some way or other to let him know it sooner; but that I thought, after
his slighting the mother, as above, he had summed up his affection to
the child in the letter he had wrote to me about providing for it; and
that he had, as other fathers often do, looked upon it as a birth which,
being out of the way, was to be forgotten, as its beginning was to be
repented of; that in providing sufficiently for it he had done more than
all such fathers used to do, and might be well satisfied with it.

He answered me that he should have been very glad if I had been so good
but to have given him the satisfaction of knowing the poor unfortunate
creature was yet alive, and he would have taken some care of it upon
himself, and particularly by owning it for a legitimate child, which,
where nobody had known to the contrary, would have taken off the infamy
which would otherwise cleave to it, and so the child should not itself
have known anything of its own disaster; but that he feared it was now
too late.

He added that I might see by all his conduct since that what unhappy
mistake drew him into the thing at first, and that he would have been
very far from doing the injury to me, or being instrumental to add _une
miserable_ (that was his word) to the world, if he had not been drawn
into it by the hopes he had of making me his own; but that, if it was
possible to rescue the child from the consequences of its unhappy birth,
he hoped I would give him leave to do it, and he would let me see that
he had both means and affection still to do it; and that,
notwithstanding all the misfortunes that had befallen him, nothing that
belonged to him, especially by a mother he had such a concern for as he
had for me, should ever want what he was in a condition to do for it.

I could not hear this without being sensibly touched with it. I was
ashamed that he should show that he had more real affection for the
child, though he had never seen it in his life, than I that bore it, for
indeed I did not love the child, nor love to see it; and though I had
provided for it, yet I did it by Amy's hand, and had not seen it above
twice in four years, being privately resolved that when it grew up it
should not be able to call me mother.

However, I told him the child was taken care of, and that he need not be
anxious about it, unless he suspected that I had less affection for it
than he that had never seen it in his life; that he knew what I had
promised him to do for it, namely, to give it the thousand pistoles
which I had offered him, and which he had declined; that I assured him I
had made my will, and that I had left it £5000, and the interest of it
till he should come of age, if I died before that time; that I would
still be as good as that to it; but if he had a mind to take it from me
into his government, I would not be against it; and to satisfy him that
I would perform what I said, I would cause the child to be delivered to
him, and the £5000 also for its support, depending upon it that he would
show himself a father to it by what I saw of his affection to it now.

I had observed that he had hinted two or three times in his discourse,
his having had misfortunes in the world, and I was a little surprised at
the expression, especially at the repeating it so often; but I took no
notice of that part yet.

He thanked me for my kindness to the child with a tenderness which
showed the sincerity of all he had said before, and which increased the
regret with which, as I said, I looked back on the little affection I
had showed to the poor child. He told me he did not desire to take him
from me, but so as to introduce him into the world as his own, which he
could still do, having lived absent from his other children (for he had
two sons and a daughter which were brought up at Nimeguen, in Holland,
with a sister of his) so long that he might very well send another son
of ten years old to be bred up with them, and suppose his mother to be
dead or alive, as he found occasion; and that, as I had resolved to do
so handsomely for the child, he would add to it something considerable,
though, having had some great disappointments (repeating the words), he
could not do for it as he would otherwise have done.

I then thought myself obliged to take notice of his having so often
mentioned his having met with disappointments. I told him I was very
sorry to hear he had met with anything afflicting to him in the world;
that I would not have anything belonging to me add to his loss, or
weaken him in what he might do for his other children; and that I would
not agree to his having the child away, though the proposal was
infinitely to the child's advantage, unless he would promise me that the
whole expense should be mine, and that, if he did not think £5000 enough
for the child, I would give it more.

We had so much discourse upon this and the old affairs that it took up
all our time at his first visit. I was a little importunate with him to
tell me how he came to find me out, but he put it off for that time,
and only obtaining my leave to visit me again, he went away; and indeed
my heart was so full with what he had said already that I was glad when
he went away. Sometimes I was full of tenderness and affection for him,
and especially when he expressed himself so earnestly and passionately
about the child; other times I was crowded with doubts about his
circumstances. Sometimes I was terrified with apprehensions lest, if I
should come into a close correspondence with him, he should any way come
to hear what kind of life I had led at Pall Mall and in other places,
and it might make me miserable afterwards; from which last thought I
concluded that I had better repulse him again than receive him. All
these thoughts, and many more, crowded in so fast, I say, upon me that I
wanted to give vent to them and get rid of him, and was very glad when
he was gone away.

We had several meetings after this, in which still we had so many
preliminaries to go through that we scarce ever bordered upon the main
subject. Once, indeed, he said something of it, and I put it off with a
kind of a jest. "Alas!" says I, "those things are out of the question
now; 'tis almost two ages since those things were talked between us,"
says I. "You see I am grown an old woman since that." Another time he
gave a little push at it again, and I laughed again. "Why, what dost
thou talk of?" said I in a formal way. "Dost thou not see I am turned
Quaker? I cannot speak of those things now." "Why," says he, "the
Quakers marry as well as other people, and love one another as well.
Besides," says he, "the Quakers' dress does not ill become you," and so
jested with me again, and so it went off for a third time. However, I
began to be kind to him in process of time, as they call it, and we grew
very intimate; and if the following accident had not unluckily
intervened, I had certainly married him, or consented to marry him, the
very next time he had asked me.

I had long waited for a letter from Amy, who, it seems, was just at that
time gone to Rouen the second time, to make her inquiries about him; and
I received a letter from her at this unhappy juncture, which gave me the
following account of my business:--

I. That for my gentleman, who I had now, as I may say, in my arms, she
said he had been gone from Paris, as I have hinted, having met with some
great losses and misfortunes; that he had been in Holland on that very
account, whither he had also carried his children; that he was after
that settled for some time at Rouen; that she had been at Rouen, and
found there (by a mere accident), from a Dutch skipper, that he was at
London, had been there above three years; that he was to be found upon
the Exchange, on the French walk; and that he lodged at St. Laurence
Pountney's Lane, and the like; so Amy said she supposed I might soon
find him out, but that she doubted he was poor, and not worth looking
after. This she did because of the next clause, which the jade had most
mind to on many accounts.

II. That as to the Prince ----; that, as above, he was gone into
Germany, where his estate lay; that he had quitted the French service,
and lived retired; that she had seen his gentleman, who remained at
Paris to solicit his arrears, &c.; that he had given her an account how
his lord had employed him to inquire for me and find me out, as above,
and told her what pains he had taken to find me; that he had understood
that I was gone to England; that he once had orders to go to England to
find me; that his lord had resolved, if he could have found me, to have
called me a countess, and so have married me, and have carried me into
Germany with him; and that his commission was still to assure me that
the prince would marry me if I would come to him, and that he would send
him an account that he had found me, and did not doubt but he would have
orders to come over to England to attend me in a figure suitable to my
quality.

Amy, an ambitious jade, who knew my weakest part--namely, that I loved
great things, and that I loved to be flattered and courted--said
abundance of kind things upon this occasion, which she knew were
suitable to me and would prompt my vanity; and talked big of the
prince's gentleman having orders to come over to me with a procuration
to marry me by proxy (as princes usually do in like cases), and to
furnish me with an equipage, and I know not how many fine things; but
told me, withal, that she had not yet let him know that she belonged to
me still, or that she knew where to find me, or to write to me; because
she was willing to see the bottom of it, and whether it was a reality or
a gasconade. She had indeed told him that, if he had any such
commission, she would endeavour to find me out, but no more.

III. For the Jew, she assured me that she had not been able to come at a
certainty what was become of him, or in what part of the world he was;
but that thus much she had learned from good hands, that he had
committed a crime, in being concerned in a design to rob a rich banker
at Paris; and that he was fled, and had not been heard of there for
above six years.

IV. For that of my husband, the brewer, she learned, that being
commanded into the field upon an occasion of some action in Flanders, he
was wounded at the battle of Mons, and died of his wounds in the
Hospital of the Invalids; so there was an end of my four inquiries,
which I sent her over to make.

This account of the prince, and the return of his affection to me, with
all the flattering great things which seemed to come along with it; and
especially as they came gilded and set out by my maid Amy--I say this
account of the prince came to me in a very unlucky hour, and in the very
crisis of my affair.

The merchant and I had entered into close conferences upon the grand
affair. I had left off talking my platonics, and of my independency, and
being a free woman, as before; and he having cleared up my doubts too,
as to his circumstances and the misfortunes he had spoken of, I had gone
so far that we had begun to consider where we should live, and in what
figure, what equipage, what house, and the like.

I had made some harangues upon the delightful retirement of a country
life, and how we might enjoy ourselves so effectually without the
encumbrances of business and the world; but all this was grimace, and
purely because I was afraid to make any public appearance in the world,
for fear some impertinent person of quality should chop upon me again
and cry out, "Roxana, Roxana, by ----!" with an oath, as had been done
before.

My merchant, bred to business and used to converse among men of
business, could hardly tell how to live without it; at least it appeared
he should be like a fish out of water, uneasy and dying. But, however,
he joined with me; only argued that we might live as near London as we
could, that he might sometimes come to 'Change and hear how the world
should go abroad, and how it fared with his friends and his children.

I answered that if he chose still to embarrass himself with business, I
supposed it would be more to his satisfaction to be in his own country,
and where his family was so well known, and where his children also
were.

He smiled at the thoughts of that, and let me know that he should be
very willing to embrace such an offer; but that he could not expect it
of me, to whom England was, to be sure, so naturalised now as that it
would be carrying me out of my native country, which he would not desire
by any means, however agreeable it might be to him.

I told him he was mistaken in me; that as I had told him so much of a
married state being a captivity, and the family being a house of
bondage, that when I married I expected to be but an upper servant; so,
if I did notwithstanding submit to it, I hoped he should see I knew how
to act the servant's part, and do everything to oblige my master; that
if I did not resolve to go with him wherever he desired to go, he might
depend I would never have him. "And did I not," said I, "offer myself to
go with you to the East Indies?"

All this while this was indeed but a copy of my countenance; for, as my
circumstances would not admit of my stay in London, at least not so as
to appear publicly, I resolved, if I took him, to live remote in the
country, or go out of England with him.

But in an evil hour, just now came Amy's letter, in the very middle of
all these discourses; and the fine things she had said about the prince
began to make strange work with me. The notion of being a princess, and
going over to live where all that had happened here would have been
quite sunk out of knowledge as well as out of memory (conscience
excepted), was mighty taking. The thoughts of being surrounded with
domestics, honoured with titles, be called her Highness, and live in all
the splendour of a court, and, which was still more, in the arms of a
man of such rank, and who, I knew, loved and valued me--all this, in a
word, dazzled my eyes, turned my head, and I was as truly crazed and
distracted for about a fortnight as most of the people in Bedlam, though
perhaps not quite so far gone.

When my gentleman came to me the next time I had no notion of him; I
wished I had never received him at all. In short, I resolved to have no
more to say to him, so I feigned myself indisposed; and though I did
come down to him and speak to him a little, yet I let him see that I was
so ill that I was (as we say) no company, and that it would be kind in
him to give me leave to quit him for that time.

The next morning he sent a footman to inquire how I did; and I let him
know I had a violent cold, and was very ill with it. Two days after he
came again, and I let him see me again, but feigned myself so hoarse
that I could not speak to be heard, and that it was painful to me but to
whisper; and, in a word, I held him in this suspense near three weeks.

During this time I had a strange elevation upon my mind; and the prince,
or the spirit of him, had such a possession of me that I spent most of
this time in the realising all the great things of a life with the
prince, to my mind pleasing my fancy with the grandeur I was supposing
myself to enjoy, and with wickedly studying in what manner to put off
this gentleman and be rid of him for ever.

I cannot but say that sometimes the baseness of the action stuck hard
with me; the honour and sincerity with which he had always treated me,
and, above all, the fidelity he had showed me at Paris, and that I owed
my life to him--I say, all these stared in my face, and I frequently
argued with myself upon the obligation I was under to him, and how base
would it be now too, after so many obligations and engagements, to cast
him off.

But the title of highness, and of a princess, and all those fine things,
as they came in, weighed down all this; and the sense of gratitude
vanished as if it had been a shadow.

At other times I considered the wealth I was mistress of; that I was
able to live like a princess, though not a princess; and that my
merchant (for he had told me all the affair of his misfortunes) was far
from being poor, or even mean; that together we were able to make up an
estate of between three and four thousand pounds a year, which was in
itself equal to some princes abroad. But though this was true, yet the
name of princess, and the flutter of it--in a word, the pride--weighed
them down; and all these arguings generally ended to the disadvantage of
my merchant; so that, in short, I resolved to drop him, and give him a
final answer at his next coming; namely, that something had happened in
my affairs which had caused me to alter my measures unexpectedly, and,
in a word, to desire him to trouble himself no farther.

I think, verily, this rude treatment of him was for some time the effect
of a violent fermentation in my blood; for the very motion which the
steady contemplation of my fancied greatness had put my spirits into had
thrown me into a kind of fever, and I scarce knew what I did.

I have wondered since that it did not make me mad; nor do I now think it
strange to hear of those who have been quite lunatic with their pride,
that fancied themselves queens and empresses, and have made their
attendants serve them upon the knee, given visitors their hand to kiss,
and the like; for certainly, if pride will not turn the brain, nothing
can.

However, the next time my gentleman came, I had not courage enough, or
not ill nature enough, to treat him in the rude manner I had resolved to
do, and it was very well I did not; for soon after, I had another letter
from Amy, in which was the mortifying news, and indeed surprising to me,
that my prince (as I, with a secret pleasure, had called him) was very
much hurt by a bruise he had received in hunting and engaging with a
wild boar, a cruel and desperate sport which the noblemen of Germany, it
seems, much delight in.

This alarmed me indeed, and the more because Amy wrote me word that his
gentleman was gone away express to him, not without apprehensions that
he should find his master was dead before his coming home; but that he
(the gentleman) had promised her that as soon as he arrived he would
send back the same courier to her with an account of his master's
health, and of the main affair; and that he had obliged Amy to stay at
Paris fourteen days for his return; she having promised him before to
make it her business to go to England and to find me out for his lord if
he sent her such orders; and he was to send her a bill for fifty
pistoles for her journey. So Amy told me she waited for the answer.

This was a blow to me several ways; for, first, I was in a state of
uncertainty as to his person, whether he was alive or dead; and I was
not unconcerned in that part, I assure you; for I had an inexpressible
affection remaining for his person, besides the degree to which it was
revived by the view of a firmer interest in him. But this was not all,
for in losing him I forever lost the prospect of all the gaiety and
glory that had made such an impression upon my imagination.

In this state of uncertainty, I say, by Amy's letter, I was like still
to remain another fortnight; and had I now continued the resolution of
using my merchant in the rude manner I once intended, I had made perhaps
a sorry piece of work of it indeed, and it was very well my heart failed
me as it did.

However, I treated him with a great many shuffles, and feigned stories
to keep him off from any closer conferences than we had already had,
that I might act afterwards as occasion might offer, one way or other.
But that which mortified me most was, that Amy did not write, though the
fourteen days were expired. At last, to my great surprise, when I was,
with the utmost impatience, looking out at the window, expecting the
postman that usually brought the foreign letters--I say I was agreeably
surprised to see a coach come to the yard-gate where we lived, and my
woman Amy alight out of it and come towards the door, having the
coachman bringing several bundles after her.

I flew like lightning downstairs to speak to her, but was soon damped
with her news. "Is the prince alive or dead, Amy?" says I. She spoke
coldly and slightly. "He is alive, madam," said she. "But it is not much
matter; I had as lieu he had been dead." So we went upstairs again to my
chamber, and there we began a serious discourse of the whole matter.

First, she told me a long story of his being hurt by a wild boar, and of
the condition he was reduced to, so that every one expected he should
die, the anguish of the wound having thrown him into a fever, with
abundance of circumstances too long to relate here; how he recovered of
that extreme danger, but continued very weak; how the gentleman had been
_homme de parole_, and had sent back the courier as punctually as if it
had been to the king; that he had given a long account of his lord, and
of his illness and recovery; but the sum of the matter, as to me, was,
that as to the lady, his lord was turned penitent, was under some vows
for his recovery, and could not think any more on that affair; and
especially, the lady being gone, and that it had not been offered to
her, so there was no breach of honour; but that his lord was sensible of
the good offices of Mrs. Amy, and had sent her the fifty pistoles for
her trouble, as if she had really gone the journey.

I was, I confess, hardly able to bear the first surprise of this
disappointment. Amy saw it, and gapes out (as was her way), "Lawd,
madam! never be concerned at it; you see he is gotten among the priests,
and I suppose they have saucily imposed some penance upon him, and, it
may be, sent him of an errand barefoot to some Madonna or Nôtredame, or
other; and he is off of his amours for the present. I'll warrant you
he'll be as wicked again as ever he was when he is got thorough well,
and gets but out of their hands again. I hate this out-o'-season
repentance. What occasion had he, in his repentance, to be off of taking
a good wife? I should have been glad to see you have been a princess,
and all that; but if it can't be, never afflict yourself; you are rich
enough to be a princess to yourself; you don't want him, that's the best
of it."

Well, I cried for all that, and was heartily vexed, and that a great
while; but as Amy was always at my elbow, and always jogging it out of
my head with her mirth and her wit, it wore off again.

Then I told Amy all the story of my merchant, and how he had found me
out when I was in such a concern to find him; how it was true that he
lodged in St. Laurence Pountney's Lane; and how I had had all the story
of his misfortune, which she had heard of, in which he had lost above
£8000 sterling; and that he had told me frankly of it before she had
sent me any account of it, or at least before I had taken any notice
that I had heard of it.

Amy was very joyful at that part. "Well, madam, then," says Amy, "what
need you value the story of the prince, and going I know not whither
into Germany to lay your bones in another world, and learn the devil's
language, called High Dutch? You are better here by half," says Amy.
"Lawd, madam!" says she; "why, are you not as rich as Croesus?"

Well, it was a great while still before I could bring myself off of this
fancied sovereignty; and I, that was so willing once to be mistress to a
king, was now ten thousand times more fond of being wife to a prince.

So fast a hold has pride and ambition upon our minds, that when once it
gets admission, nothing is so chimerical but, under this possession, we
can form ideas of in our fancy and realise to our imagination. Nothing
can be so ridiculous as the simple steps we take in such cases; a man or
a woman becomes a mere _malade imaginaire_, and, I believe, may as
easily die with grief or run mad with joy (as the affair in his fancy
appears right or wrong) as if all was real, and actually under the
management of the person.

I had indeed two assistants to deliver me from this snare, and these
were, first, Amy, who knew my disease, but was able to do nothing as to
the remedy; the second, the merchant, who really brought the remedy, but
knew nothing of the distemper.

I remember, when all these disorders were upon my thoughts, in one of
the visits my friend the merchant made me, he took notice that he
perceived I was under some unusual disorder; he believed, he said, that
my distemper, whatever it was, lay much in my head, and it being summer
weather and very hot, proposed to me to go a little way into the air.

I started at his expression. "What!" says I; "do you think, then, that I
am crazed? You should, then, propose a madhouse for my cure." "No, no,"
says he, "I do not mean anything like that; I hope the head may be
distempered and not the brain." Well, I was too sensible that he was
right, for I knew I had acted a strange, wild kind of part with him; but
he insisted upon it, and pressed me to go into the country. I took him
short again. "What need you," says I, "send me out of your way? It is in
your power to be less troubled with me, and with less inconvenience to
us both."

He took that ill, and told me I used to have a better opinion of his
sincerity, and desired to know what he had done to forfeit my charity.
I mention this only to let you see how far I had gone in my measures of
quitting him--that is to say, how near I was of showing him how base,
ungrateful, and how vilely I could act; but I found I had carried the
jest far enough, and that a little matter might have made him sick of me
again, as he was before; so I began by little and little to change my
way of talking to him, and to come to discourse to the purpose again as
we had done before.

A while after this, when we were very merry and talking familiarly
together, he called me, with an air of particular satisfaction, his
princess. I coloured at the word, for it indeed touched me to the quick;
but he knew nothing of the reason of my being touched with it. "What
d'ye mean by that?" said I. "Nay," says he, "I mean nothing but that you
are a princess to me." "Well," says I, "as to that I am content, and yet
I could tell you I might have been a pri

To the Honourable

GEORGE LYTTLETON, ESQ;

One of the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

Sir,

Notwithstanding your constant refusal, when I have asked leave to
prefix your name to this dedication, I must still insist on my right
to desire your protection of this work.

To you, Sir, it is owing that this history was ever begun. It was by
your desire that I first thought of such a composition. So many years
have since past, that you may have, perhaps, forgotten this
circumstance: but your desires are to me in the nature of commands;
and the impression of them is never to be erased from my memory.

Again, Sir, without your assistance this history had never been
completed. Be not startled at the assertion. I do not intend to draw
on you the suspicion of being a romance writer. I mean no more than
that I partly owe to you my existence during great part of the time
which I have employed in composing it: another matter which it may be
necessary to remind you of; since there are certain actions of which
you are apt to be extremely forgetful; but of these I hope I shall
always have a better memory than yourself.

Lastly, It is owing to you that the history appears what it now is. If
there be in this work, as some have been pleased to say, a stronger
picture of a truly benevolent mind than is to be found in any other,
who that knows you, and a particular acquaintance of yours, will doubt
whence that benevolence hath been copied? The world will not, I
believe, make me the compliment of thinking I took it from myself. I
care not: this they shall own, that the two persons from whom I have
taken it, that is to say, two of the best and worthiest men in the
world, are strongly and zealously my friends. I might be contented
with this, and yet my vanity will add a third to the number; and him
one of the greatest and noblest, not only in his rank, but in every
public and private virtue. But here, whilst my gratitude for the
princely benefactions of the Duke of Bedford bursts from my heart, you
must forgive my reminding you that it was you who first recommended me
to the notice of my benefactor.

And what are your objections to the allowance of the honour which I
have sollicited? Why, you have commended the book so warmly, that you
should be ashamed of reading your name before the dedication. Indeed,
sir, if the book itself doth not make you ashamed of your
commendations, nothing that I can here write will, or ought. I am not
to give up my right to your protection and patronage, because you have
commended my book: for though I acknowledge so many obligations to
you, I do not add this to the number; in which friendship, I am
convinced, hath so little share: since that can neither biass your
judgment, nor pervert your integrity. An enemy may at any time obtain
your commendation by only deserving it; and the utmost which the
faults of your friends can hope for, is your silence; or, perhaps, if
too severely accused, your gentle palliation.

In short, sir, I suspect, that your dislike of public praise is your
true objection to granting my request. I have observed that you have,
in common with my two other friends, an unwillingness to hear the
least mention of your own virtues; that, as a great poet says of one
of you, (he might justly have said it of all three), you

     _Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame_.

If men of this disposition are as careful to shun applause, as others
are to escape censure, how just must be your apprehension of your
character falling into my hands; since what would not a man have
reason to dread, if attacked by an author who had received from him
injuries equal to my obligations to you!

And will not this dread of censure increase in proportion to the
matter which a man is conscious of having afforded for it? If his
whole life, for instance, should have been one continued subject of
satire, he may well tremble when an incensed satirist takes him in
hand. Now, sir, if we apply this to your modest aversion to panegyric,
how reasonable will your fears of me appear!

Yet surely you might have gratified my ambition, from this single
confidence, that I shall always prefer the indulgence of your
inclinations to the satisfaction of my own. A very strong instance of
which I shall give you in this address, in which I am determined to
follow the example of all other dedicators, and will consider not what
my patron really deserves to have written, but what he will be best
pleased to read.

Without further preface then, I here present you with the labours of
some years of my life. What merit these labours have is already known
to yourself. If, from your favourable judgment, I have conceived some
esteem for them, it cannot be imputed to vanity; since I should have
agreed as implicitly to your opinion, had it been given in favour of
any other man's production. Negatively, at least, I may be allowed to
say, that had I been sensible of any great demerit in the work, you
are the last person to whose protection I would have ventured to
recommend it.

From the name of my patron, indeed, I hope my reader will be
convinced, at his very entrance on this work, that he will find in the
whole course of it nothing prejudicial to the cause of religion and
virtue, nothing inconsistent with the strictest rules of decency, nor
which can offend even the chastest eye in the perusal. On the
contrary, I declare, that to recommend goodness and innocence hath
been my sincere endeavour in this history. This honest purpose you
have been pleased to think I have attained: and to say the truth, it
is likeliest to be attained in books of this kind; for an example is a
kind of picture, in which virtue becomes, as it were, an object of
sight, and strikes us with an idea of that loveliness, which Plato
asserts there is in her naked charms.

Besides displaying that beauty of virtue which may attract the
admiration of mankind, I have attempted to engage a stronger motive to
human action in her favour, by convincing men, that their true
interest directs them to a pursuit of her. For this purpose I have
shown that no acquisitions of guilt can compensate the loss of that
solid inward comfort of mind, which is the sure companion of innocence
and virtue; nor can in the least balance the evil of that horror and
anxiety which, in their room, guilt introduces into our bosoms. And
again, that as these acquisitions are in themselves generally
worthless, so are the means to attain them not only base and infamous,
but at best incertain, and always full of danger. Lastly, I have
endeavoured strongly to inculcate, that virtue and innocence can
scarce ever be injured but by indiscretion; and that it is this alone
which often betrays them into the snares that deceit and villainy
spread for them. A moral which I have the more industriously laboured,
as the teaching it is, of all others, the likeliest to be attended
with success; since, I believe, it is much easier to make good men
wise, than to make bad men good.

For these purposes I have employed all the wit and humour of which I
am master in the following history; wherein I have endeavoured to
laugh mankind out of their favourite follies and vices. How far I have
succeeded in this good attempt, I shall submit to the candid reader,
with only two requests: First, that he will not expect to find
perfection in this work; and Secondly, that he will excuse some parts
of it, if they fall short of that little merit which I hope may appear
in others.

I will detain you, sir, no longer. Indeed I have run into a preface,
while I professed to write a dedication. But how can it be otherwise?
I dare not praise you; and the only means I know of to avoid it, when
you are in my thoughts, are either to be entirely silent, or to turn
my thoughts to some other subject.

Pardon, therefore, what I have said in this epistle, not only without
your consent, but absolutely against it; and give me at least leave,
in this public manner, to declare that I am, with the highest respect
and gratitude,--

Sir,

Your most obliged,

Obedient, humble servant,

HENRY FIELDING.





THE HISTORY OF TOM JONES, A FOUNDLING.




BOOK I.

CONTAINING AS MUCH OF THE BIRTH OF THE FOUNDLING AS IS NECESSARY OR
PROPER TO ACQUAINT THE READER WITH IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS HISTORY.



Chapter i.

The introduction to the work, or bill of fare to the feast.


An author ought to consider himself, not as a gentleman who gives a
private or eleemosynary treat, but rather as one who keeps a public
ordinary, at which all persons are welcome for their money. In the
former case, it is well known that the entertainer provides what fare
he pleases; and though this should be very indifferent, and utterly
disagreeable to the taste of his company, they must not find any
fault; nay, on the contrary, good breeding forces them outwardly to
approve and to commend whatever is set before them. Now the contrary
of this happens to the master of an ordinary. Men who pay for what
they eat will insist on gratifying their palates, however nice and
whimsical these may prove; and if everything is not agreeable to their
taste, will challenge a right to censure, to abuse, and to d--n their
dinner without controul.

To prevent, therefore, giving offence to their customers by any such
disappointment, it hath been usual with the honest and well-meaning
host to provide a bill of fare which all persons may peruse at their
first entrance into the house; and having thence acquainted themselves
with the entertainment which they may expect, may either stay and
regale with what is provided for them, or may depart to some other
ordinary better accommodated to their taste.

As we do not disdain to borrow wit or wisdom from any man who is
capable of lending us either, we have condescended to take a hint from
these honest victuallers, and shall prefix not only a general bill of
fare to our whole entertainment, but shall likewise give the reader
particular bills to every course which is to be served up in this and
the ensuing volumes.

The provision, then, which we have here made is no other than _Human
Nature_. Nor do I fear that my sensible reader, though most luxurious
in his taste, will start, cavil, or be offended, because I have named
but one article. The tortoise--as the alderman of Bristol, well
learned in eating, knows by much experience--besides the delicious
calipash and calipee, contains many different kinds of food; nor can
the learned reader be ignorant, that in human nature, though here
collected under one general name, is such prodigious variety, that a
cook will have sooner gone through all the several species of animal
and vegetable food in the world, than an author will be able to
exhaust so extensive a subject.

An objection may perhaps be apprehended from the more delicate, that
this dish is too common and vulgar; for what else is the subject of
all the romances, novels, plays, and poems, with which the stalls
abound? Many exquisite viands might be rejected by the epicure, if it
was a sufficient cause for his contemning of them as common and
vulgar, that something was to be found in the most paltry alleys under
the same name. In reality, true nature is as difficult to be met with
in authors, as the Bayonne ham, or Bologna sausage, is to be found in
the shops.

But the whole, to continue the same metaphor, consists in the cookery
of the author; for, as Mr Pope tells us--

    "True wit is nature to advantage drest;
    What oft was thought, but ne'er so well exprest."

The same animal which hath the honour to have some part of his flesh
eaten at the table of a duke, may perhaps be degraded in another part,
and some of his limbs gibbeted, as it were, in the vilest stall in
town. Where, then, lies the difference between the food of the
nobleman and the porter, if both are at dinner on the same ox or calf,
but in the seasoning, the dressing, the garnishing, and the setting
forth? Hence the one provokes and incites the most languid appetite,
and the other turns and palls that which is the sharpest and keenest.

In like manner, the excellence of the mental entertainment consists
less in the subject than in the author's skill in well dressing it up.
How pleased, therefore, will the reader be to find that we have, in
the following work, adhered closely to one of the highest principles
of the best cook which the present age, or perhaps that of
Heliogabalus, hath produced. This great man, as is well known to all
lovers of polite eating, begins at first by setting plain things
before his hungry guests, rising afterwards by degrees as their
stomachs may be supposed to decrease, to the very quintessence of
sauce and spices. In like manner, we shall represent human nature at
first to the keen appetite of our reader, in that more plain and
simple manner in which it is found in the country, and shall hereafter
hash and ragoo it with all the high French and Italian seasoning of
affectation and vice which courts and cities afford. By these means,
we doubt not but our reader may be rendered desirous to read on for
ever, as the great person just above-mentioned is supposed to have
made some persons eat.

Having premised thus much, we will now detain those who like our bill
of fare no longer from their diet, and shall proceed directly to serve
up the first course of our history for their entertainment.



Chapter ii.

A short description of squire Allworthy, and a fuller account of Miss
Bridget Allworthy, his sister.


In that part of the western division of this kingdom which is commonly
called Somersetshire, there lately lived, and perhaps lives still, a
gentleman whose name was Allworthy, and who might well be called the
favourite of both nature and fortune; for both of these seem to have
contended which should bless and enrich him most. In this contention,
nature may seem to some to have come off victorious, as she bestowed
on him many gifts, while fortune had only one gift in her power; but
in pouring forth this, she was so very profuse, that others perhaps
may think this single endowment to have been more than equivalent to
all the various blessings which he enjoyed from nature. From the
former of these, he derived an agreeable person, a sound constitution,
a solid understanding, and a benevolent heart; by the latter, he was
decreed to the inheritance of one of the largest estates in the
county.

This gentleman had in his youth married a very worthy and beautiful
woman, of whom he had been extremely fond: by her he had three
children, all of whom died in their infancy. He had likewise had the
misfortune of burying this beloved wife herself, about five years
before the time in which this history chuses to set out. This loss,
however great, he bore like a man of sense and constancy, though it
must be confest he would often talk a little whimsically on this head;
for he sometimes said he looked on himself as still married, and
considered his wife as only gone a little before him, a journey which
he should most certainly, sooner or later, take after her; and that he
had not the least doubt of meeting her again in a place where he
should never part with her more--sentiments for which his sense was
arraigned by one part of his neighbours, his religion by a second, and
his sincerity by a third.

He now lived, for the most part, retired in the country, with one
sister, for whom he had a very tender affection. This lady was now
somewhat past the age of thirty, an aera at which, in the opinion of
the malicious, the title of old maid may with no impropriety be
assumed. She was of that species of women whom you commend rather for
good qualities than beauty, and who are generally called, by their own
sex, very good sort of women--as good a sort of woman, madam, as you
would wish to know. Indeed, she was so far from regretting want of
beauty, that she never mentioned that perfection, if it can be called
one, without contempt; and would often thank God she was not as
handsome as Miss Such-a-one, whom perhaps beauty had led into errors
which she might have otherwise avoided. Miss Bridget Allworthy (for
that was the name of this lady) very rightly conceived the charms of
person in a woman to be no better than snares for herself, as well as
for others; and yet so discreet was she in her conduct, that her
prudence was as much on the guard as if she had all the snares to
apprehend which were ever laid for her whole sex. Indeed, I have
observed, though it may seem unaccountable to the reader, that this
guard of prudence, like the trained bands, is always readiest to go on
duty where there is the least danger. It often basely and cowardly
deserts those paragons for whom the men are all wishing, sighing,
dying, and spreading, every net in their power; and constantly attends
at the heels of that higher order of women for whom the other sex have
a more distant and awful respect, and whom (from despair, I suppose,
of success) they never venture to attack.

Reader, I think proper, before we proceed any farther together, to
acquaint thee that I intend to digress, through this whole history, as
often as I see occasion, of which I am myself a better judge than any
pitiful critic whatever; and here I must desire all those critics to
mind their own business, and not to intermeddle with affairs or works
which no ways concern them; for till they produce the authority by
which they are constituted judges, I shall not plead to their
jurisdiction.



Chapter iii.

An odd accident which befel Mr Allworthy at his return home. The
decent behaviour of Mrs Deborah Wilkins, with some proper
animadversions on bastards.


I have told my reader, in the preceding chapter, that Mr Allworthy
inherited a large fortune; that he had a good heart, and no family.
Hence, doubtless, it will be concluded by many that he lived like an
honest man, owed no one a shilling, took nothing but what was his own,
kept a good house, entertained his neighbours with a hearty welcome at
his table, and was charitable to the poor, i.e. to those who had
rather beg than work, by giving them the offals from it; that he died
immensely rich and built an hospital.

And true it is that he did many of these things; but had he done
nothing more I should have left him to have recorded his own merit on
some fair freestone over the door of that hospital. Matters of a much
more extraordinary kind are to be the subject of this history, or I
should grossly mis-spend my time in writing so voluminous a work; and
you, my sagacious friend, might with equal profit and pleasure travel
through some pages which certain droll authors have been facetiously
pleased to call _The History of England_.

Mr Allworthy had been absent a full quarter of a year in London, on
some very particular business, though I know not what it was; but
judge of its importance by its having detained him so long from home,
whence he had not been absent a month at a time during the space of
many years. He came to his house very late in the evening, and after a
short supper with his sister, retired much fatigued to his chamber.
Here, having spent some minutes on his knees--a custom which he never
broke through on any account--he was preparing to step into bed, when,
upon opening the cloathes, to his great surprize he beheld an infant,
wrapt up in some coarse linen, in a sweet and profound sleep, between
his sheets. He stood some time lost in astonishment at this sight;
but, as good nature had always the ascendant in his mind, he soon
began to be touched with sentiments of compassion for the little
wretch before him. He then rang his bell, and ordered an elderly
woman-servant to rise immediately, and come to him; and in the
meantime was so eager in contemplating the beauty of innocence,
appearing in those lively colours with which infancy and sleep always
display it, that his thoughts were too much engaged to reflect that he
was in his shirt when the matron came in. She had indeed given her
master sufficient time to dress himself; for out of respect to him,
and regard to decency, she had spent many minutes in adjusting her
hair at the looking-glass, notwithstanding all the hurry in which she
had been summoned by the servant, and though her master, for aught she
knew, lay expiring in an apoplexy, or in some other fit.

It will not be wondered at that a creature who had so strict a regard
to decency in her own person, should be shocked at the least deviation
from it in another. She therefore no sooner opened the door, and saw
her master standing by the bedside in his shirt, with a candle in his
hand, than she started back in a most terrible fright, and might
perhaps have swooned away, had he not now recollected his being
undrest, and put an end to her terrors by desiring her to stay without
the door till he had thrown some cloathes over his back, and was
become incapable of shocking the pure eyes of Mrs Deborah Wilkins,
who, though in the fifty-second year of her age, vowed she had never
beheld a man without his coat. Sneerers and prophane wits may perhaps
laugh at her first fright; yet my graver reader, when he considers the
time of night, the summons from her bed, and the situation in which
she found her master, will highly justify and applaud her conduct,
unless the prudence which must be supposed to attend maidens at that
period of life at which Mrs Deborah had arrived, should a little
lessen his admiration.

When Mrs Deborah returned into the room, and was acquainted by her
master with the finding the little infant, her consternation was
rather greater than his had been; nor could she refrain from crying
out, with great horror of accent as well as look, "My good sir! what's
to be done?" Mr Allworthy answered, she must take care of the child
that evening, and in the morning he would give orders to provide it a
nurse. "Yes, sir," says she; "and I hope your worship will send out
your warrant to take up the hussy its mother, for she must be one of
the neighbourhood; and I should be glad to see her committed to
Bridewell, and whipt at the cart's tail. Indeed, such wicked sluts
cannot be too severely punished. I'll warrant 'tis not her first, by
her impudence in laying it to your worship." "In laying it to me,
Deborah!" answered Allworthy: "I can't think she hath any such design.
I suppose she hath only taken this method to provide for her child;
and truly I am glad she hath not done worse." "I don't know what is
worse," cries Deborah, "than for such wicked strumpets to lay their
sins at honest men's doors; and though your worship knows your own
innocence, yet the world is censorious; and it hath been many an
honest man's hap to pass for the father of children he never begot;
and if your worship should provide for the child, it may make the
people the apter to believe; besides, why should your worship provide
for what the parish is obliged to maintain? For my own part, if it was
an honest man's child, indeed--but for my own part, it goes against me
to touch these misbegotten wretches, whom I don't look upon as my
fellow-creatures. Faugh! how it stinks! It doth not smell like a
Christian. If I might be so bold to give my advice, I would have it
put in a basket, and sent out and laid at the churchwarden's door. It
is a good night, only a little rainy and windy; and if it was well
wrapt up, and put in a warm basket, it is two to one but it lives till
it is found in the morning. But if it should not, we have discharged
our duty in taking proper care of it; and it is, perhaps, better for
such creatures to die in a state of innocence, than to grow up and
imitate their mothers; for nothing better can be expected of them."

There were some strokes in this speech which perhaps would have
offended Mr Allworthy, had he strictly attended to it; but he had now
got one of his fingers into the infant's hand, which, by its gentle
pressure, seeming to implore his assistance, had certainly out-pleaded
the eloquence of Mrs Deborah, had it been ten times greater than it
was. He now gave Mrs Deborah positive orders to take the child to her
own bed, and to call up a maid-servant to provide it pap, and other
things, against it waked. He likewise ordered that proper cloathes
should be procured for it early in the morning, and that it should be
brought to himself as soon as he was stirring.

Such was the discernment of Mrs Wilkins, and such the respect she bore
her master, under whom she enjoyed a most excellent place, that her
scruples gave way to his peremptory commands; and she took the child
under her arms, without any apparent disgust at the illegality of its
birth; and declaring it was a sweet little infant, walked off with it
to her own chamber.

Allworthy here betook himself to those pleasing slumbers which a heart
that hungers after goodness is apt to enjoy when thoroughly satisfied.
As these are possibly sweeter than what are occasioned by any other
hearty meal, I should take more pains to display them to the reader,
if I knew any air to recommend him to for the procuring such an
appetite.



Chapter iv.

The reader's neck brought into danger by a description; his escape;
and the great condescension of Miss Bridget Allworthy.


The Gothic stile of building could produce nothing nobler than Mr
Allworthy's house. There was an air of grandeur in it that struck you
with awe, and rivalled the beauties of the best Grecian architecture;
and it was as commodious within as venerable without.

It stood on the south-east side of a hill, but nearer the bottom than
the top of it, so as to be sheltered from the north-east by a grove of
old oaks which rose above it in a gradual ascent of near half a mile,
and yet high enough to enjoy a most charming prospect of the valley
beneath.

In the midst of the grove was a fine lawn, sloping down towards the
house, near the summit of which rose a plentiful spring, gushing out
of a rock covered with firs, and forming a constant cascade of about
thirty feet, not carried down a regular flight of steps, but tumbling
in a natural fall over the broken and mossy stones till it came to the
bottom of the rock, then running off in a pebly channel, that with
many lesser falls winded along, till it fell into a lake at the foot
of the hill, about a quarter of a mile below the house on the south
side, and which was seen from every room in the front. Out of this
lake, which filled the center of a beautiful plain, embellished with
groups of beeches and elms, and fed with sheep, issued a river, that
for several miles was seen to meander through an amazing variety of
meadows and woods till it emptied itself into the sea, with a large
arm of which, and an island beyond it, the prospect was closed.

On the right of this valley opened another of less extent, adorned
with several villages, and terminated by one of the towers of an old
ruined abby, grown over with ivy, and part of the front, which
remained still entire.

The left-hand scene presented the view of a very fine park, composed
of very unequal ground, and agreeably varied with all the diversity
that hills, lawns, wood, and water, laid out with admirable taste, but
owing less to art than to nature, could give. Beyond this, the country
gradually rose into a ridge of wild mountains, the tops of which were
above the clouds.

It was now the middle of May, and the morning was remarkably serene,
when Mr Allworthy walked forth on the terrace, where the dawn opened
every minute that lovely prospect we have before described to his eye;
and now having sent forth streams of light, which ascended the blue
firmament before him, as harbingers preceding his pomp, in the full
blaze of his majesty rose the sun, than which one object alone in this
lower creation could be more glorious, and that Mr Allworthy himself
presented--a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what
manner he might render himself most acceptable to his Creator, by
doing most good to his creatures.

Reader, take care. I have unadvisedly led thee to the top of as high a
hill as Mr Allworthy's, and how to get thee down without breaking thy
neck, I do not well know. However, let us e'en venture to slide dowr his family, very strongly corroborated
all such sober reflections; so that he once resolved to get the better
of his inclinations, and he actually abstained three whole months
without ever going to Seagrim's house, or seeing his daughter.

Now, though Molly was, as we have said, generally thought a very fine
girl, and in reality she was so, yet her beauty was not of the most
amiable kind. It had, indeed, very little of feminine in it, and would
have become a man at least as well as a woman; for, to say the truth,
youth and florid health had a very considerable share in the
composition.

Nor was her mind more effeminate than her person. As this was tall and
robust, so was that bold and forward. So little had she of modesty,
that Jones had more regard for her virtue than she herself. And as
most probably she liked Tom as well as he liked her, so when she
perceived his backwardness she herself grew proportionably forward;
and when she saw he had entirely deserted the house, she found means
of throwing herself in his way, and behaved in such a manner that the
youth must have had very much or very little of the heroe if her
endeavours had proved unsuccessful. In a word, she soon triumphed over
all the virtuous resolutions of Jones; for though she behaved at last
with all decent reluctance, yet I rather chuse to attribute the
triumph to her, since, in fact, it was her design which succeeded.

In the conduct of this matter, I say, Molly so well played her part,
that Jones attributed the conquest entirely to himself, and considered
the young woman as one who had yielded to the violent attacks of his
passion. He likewise imputed her yielding to the ungovernable force of
her love towards him; and this the reader will allow to have been a
very natural and probable supposition, as we have more than once
mentioned the uncommon comeliness of his person: and, indeed, he was
one of the handsomest young fellows in the world.

As there are some minds whose affections, like Master Blifil's, are
solely placed on one single person, whose interest and indulgence
alone they consider on every occasion; regarding the good and ill of
all others as merely indifferent, any farther than as they contribute
to the pleasure or advantage of that person: so there is a different
temper of mind which borrows a degree of virtue even from self-love.
Such can never receive any kind of satisfaction from another, without
loving the creature to whom that satisfaction is owing, and without
making its well-being in some sort necessary to their own ease.

Of this latter species was our heroe. He considered this poor girl as
one whose happiness or misery he had caused to be dependent on
himself. Her beauty was still the object of desire, though greater
beauty, or a fresher object, might have been more so; but the little
abatement which fruition had occasioned to this was highly
overbalanced by the considerations of the affection which she visibly
bore him, and of the situation into which he had brought her. The
former of these created gratitude, the latter compassion; and both,
together with his desire for her person, raised in him a passion which
might, without any great violence to the word, be called love; though,
perhaps, it was at first not very judiciously placed.

This, then, was the true reason of that insensibility which he had
shown to the charms of Sophia, and that behaviour in her which might
have been reasonably enough interpreted as an encouragement to his
addresses; for as he could not think of abandoning his Molly, poor and
destitute as she was, so no more could he entertain a notion of
betraying such a creature as Sophia. And surely, had he given the
least encouragement to any passion for that young lady, he must have
been absolutely guilty of one or other of those crimes; either of
which would, in my opinion, have very justly subjected him to that
fate, which, at his first introduction into this history, I mentioned
to have been generally predicted as his certain destiny.



Chapter vii.

Being the shortest chapter in this book.


Her mother first perceived the alteration in the shape of Molly; and
in order to hide it from her neighbours, she foolishly clothed her in
that sack which Sophia had sent her; though, indeed, that young lady
had little apprehension that the poor woman would have been weak
enough to let any of her daughters wear it in that form.

Molly was charmed with the first opportunity she ever had of showing
her beauty to advantage; for though she could very well bear to
contemplate herself in the glass, even when dressed in rags; and
though she had in that dress conquered the heart of Jones, and perhaps
of some others; yet she thought the addition of finery would much
improve her charms, and extend her conquests.

Molly, therefore, having dressed herself out in this sack, with a new
laced cap, and some other ornaments which Tom had given her, repairs
to church with her fan in her hand the very next Sunday. The great are
deceived if they imagine they have appropriated ambition and vanity to
themselves. These noble qualities flourish as notably in a country
church and churchyard as in the drawing-room, or in the closet.
Schemes have indeed been laid in the vestry which would hardly
disgrace the conclave. Here is a ministry, and here is an opposition.
Here are plots and circumventions, parties and factions, equal to
those which are to be found in courts.

Nor are the women here less practised in the highest feminine arts
than their fair superiors in quality and fortune. Here are prudes and
coquettes. Here are dressing and ogling, falsehood, envy, malice,
scandal; in short, everything which is common to the most splendid
assembly, or politest circle. Let those of high life, therefore, no
longer despise the ignorance of their inferiors; nor the vulgar any
longer rail at the vices of their betters.

Molly had seated herself some time before she was known by her
neighbours. And then a whisper ran through the whole congregation,
"Who is she?" but when she was discovered, such sneering, gigling,
tittering, and laughing ensued among the women, that Mr Allworthy was
obliged to exert his authority to preserve any decency among them.



Chapter viii.

A battle sung by the muse in the Homerican style, and which none but
the classical reader can taste.


Mr Western had an estate in this parish; and as his house stood at
little greater distance from this church than from his own, he very
often came to Divine Service here; and both he and the charming Sophia
happened to be present at this time.

Sophia was much pleased with the beauty of the girl, whom she pitied
for her simplicity in having dressed herself in that manner, as she
saw the envy which it had occasioned among her equals. She no sooner
came home than she sent for the gamekeeper, and ordered him to bring
his daughter to her; saying she would provide for her in the family,
and might possibly place the girl about her own person, when her own
maid, who was now going away, had left her.

Poor Seagrim was thunderstruck at this; for he was no stranger to the
fault in the shape of his daughter. He answered, in a stammering
voice, "That he was afraid Molly would be too awkward to wait on her
ladyship, as she had never been at service." "No matter for that,"
says Sophia; "she will soon improve. I am pleased with the girl, and
am resolved to try her."

Black George now repaired to his wife, on whose prudent counsel he
depended to extricate him out of this dilemma; but when he came
thither he found his house in some confusion. So great envy had this
sack occasioned, that when Mr Allworthy and the other gentry were gone
from church, the rage, which had hitherto been confined, burst into an
uproar; and, having vented itself at first in opprobrious words,
laughs, hisses, and gestures, betook itself at last to certain missile
weapons; which, though from their plastic nature they threatened
neither the loss of life or of limb, were however sufficiently
dreadful to a well-dressed lady. Molly had too much spirit to bear
this treatment tamely. Having therefore--but hold, as we are diffident
of our own abilities, let us here invite a superior power to our
assistance.

Ye Muses, then, whoever ye are, who love to sing battles, and
principally thou who whilom didst recount the slaughter in those
fields where Hudibras and Trulla fought, if thou wert not starved with
thy friend Butler, assist me on this great occasion. All things are
not in the power of all.

As a vast herd of cows in a rich farmer's yard, if, while they are
milked, they hear their calves at a distance, lamenting the robbery
which is then committing, roar and bellow; so roared forth the
Somersetshire mob an hallaloo, made up of almost as many squalls,
screams, and other different sounds as there were persons, or indeed
passions among them: some were inspired by rage, others alarmed by
fear, and others had nothing in their heads but the love of fun; but
chiefly Envy, the sister of Satan, and his constant companion, rushed
among the crowd, and blew up the fury of the women; who no sooner came
up to Molly than they pelted her with dirt and rubbish.

Molly, having endeavoured in vain to make a handsome retreat, faced
about; and laying hold of ragged Bess, who advanced in the front of
the enemy, she at one blow felled her to the ground. The whole army of
the enemy (though near a hundred in number), seeing the fate of their
general, gave back many paces, and retired behind a new-dug grave; for
the churchyard was the field of battle, where there was to be a
funeral that very evening. Molly pursued her victory, and catching up
a skull which lay on the side of the grave, discharged it with such
fury, that having hit a taylor on the head, the two skulls sent
equally forth a hollow sound at their meeting, and the taylor took
presently measure of his length on the ground, where the skulls lay
side by side, and it was doubtful which was the more valuable of the
two. Molly then taking a thigh-bone in her hand, fell in among the
flying ranks, and dealing her blows with great liberality on either
side, overthrew the carcass of many a mighty heroe and heroine.

Recount, O Muse, the names of those who fell on this fatal day. First,
Jemmy Tweedle felt on his hinder head the direful bone. Him the
pleasant banks of sweetly-winding Stour had nourished, where he first
learnt the vocal art, with which, wandering up and down at wakes and
fairs, he cheered the rural nymphs and swains, when upon the green
they interweaved the sprightly dance; while he himself stood fiddling
and jumping to his own music. How little now avails his fiddle! He
thumps the verdant floor with his carcass. Next, old Echepole, the
sowgelder, received a blow in his forehead from our Amazonian heroine,
and immediately fell to the ground. He was a swinging fat fellow, and
fell with almost as much noise as a house. His tobacco-box dropped at
the same time from his pocket, which Molly took up as lawful spoils.
Then Kate of the Mill tumbled unfortunately over a tombstone, which
catching hold of her ungartered stocking inverted the order of nature,
and gave her heels the superiority to her head. Betty Pippin, with
young Roger her lover, fell both to the ground; where, oh perverse
fate! she salutes the earth, and he the sky. Tom Freckle, the smith's
son, was the next victim to her rage. He was an ingenious workman, and
made excellent pattens; nay, the very patten with which he was knocked
down was his own workmanship. Had he been at that time singing psalms
in the church, he would have avoided a broken head. Miss Crow, the
daughter of a farmer; John Giddish, himself a farmer; Nan Slouch,
Esther Codling, Will Spray, Tom Bennet; the three Misses Potter, whose
father keeps the sign of the Red Lion; Betty Chambermaid, Jack Ostler,
and many others of inferior note, lay rolling among the graves.

Not that the strenuous arm of Molly reached all these; for many of
them in their flight overthrew each other.

But now Fortune, fearing she had acted out of character, and had
inclined too long to the same side, especially as it was the right
side, hastily turned about: for now Goody Brown--whom Zekiel Brown
caressed in his arms; nor he alone, but half the parish besides; so
famous was she in the fields of Venus, nor indeed less in those of
Mars. The trophies of both these her husband always bore about on his
head and face; for if ever human head did by its horns display the
amorous glories of a wife, Zekiel's did; nor did his well-scratched
face less denote her talents (or rather talons) of a different kind.

No longer bore this Amazon the shameful flight of her party. She stopt
short, and, calling aloud to all who fled, spoke as follows: "Ye
Somersetshire men, or rather ye Somersetshire women, are ye not
ashamed thus to fly from a single woman? But if no other will oppose
her, I myself and Joan Top here will have the honour of the victory."
Having thus said, she flew at Molly Seagrim, and easily wrenched the
thigh-bone from her hand, at the same time clawing off her cap from
her head. Then laying hold of the hair of Molly with her left hand,
she attacked her so furiously in the face with the right, that the
blood soon began to trickle from her nose. Molly was not idle this
while. She soon removed the clout from the head of Goody Brown, and
then fastening on her hair with one hand, with the other she caused
another bloody stream to issue forth from the nostrils of the enemy.

When each of the combatants had borne off sufficient spoils of hair
from the head of her antagonist, the next rage was against the
garments. In this attack they exerted so much violence, that in a very
few minutes they were both naked to the middle.

It is lucky for the women that the seat of fistycuff war is not the
same with them as among men; but though they may seem a little to
deviate from their sex, when they go forth to battle, yet I have
observed, they never so far forget, as to assail the bosoms of each
other; where a few blows would be fatal to most of them. This, I know,
some derive from their being of a more bloody inclination than the
males. On which account they apply to the nose, as to the part whence
blood may most easily be drawn; but this seems a far-fetched as well
as ill-natured supposition.

Goody Brown had great advantage of Molly in this particular; for the
former had indeed no breasts, her bosom (if it may be so called), as
well in colour as in many other properties, exactly resembling an
antient piece of parchment, upon which any one might have drummed a
considerable while without doing her any great damage.

Molly, beside her present unhappy condition, was differently formed in
those parts, and might, perhaps, have tempted the envy of Brown to
give her a fatal blow, had not the lucky arrival of Tom Jones at this
instant put an immediate end to the bloody scene.

This accident was luckily owing to Mr Square; for he, Master Blifil,
and Jones, had mounted their horses, after church, to take the air,
and had ridden about a quarter of a mile, when Square, changing his
mind (not idly, but for a reason which we shall unfold as soon as we
have leisure), desired the young gentlemen to ride with him another
way than they had at first purposed. This motion being complied with,
brought them of necessity back again to the churchyard.

Master Blifil, who rode first, seeing such a mob assembled, and two
women in the posture in which we left the combatants, stopt his horse
to enquire what was the matter. A country fellow, scratching his head,
answered him: "I don't know, measter, un't I; an't please your honour,
here hath been a vight, I think, between Goody Brown and Moll
Seagrim."

"Who, who?" cries Tom; but without waiting for an answer, having
discovered the features of his Molly through all the discomposure in
which they now were, he hastily alighted, turned his horse loose, and,
leaping over the wall, ran to her. She now first bursting into tears,
told him how barbarously she had been treated. Upon which, forgetting
the sex of Goody Brown, or perhaps not knowing it in his rage--for, in
reality, she had no feminine appearance but a petticoat, which he
might not observe--he gave her a lash or two with his horsewhip; and
then flying at the mob, who were all accused by Moll, he dealt his
blows so profusely on all sides, that unless I would again invoke the
muse (which the good-natured reader may think a little too hard upon
her, as she hath so lately been violently sweated), it would be
impossible for me to recount the horse-whipping of that day.

Having scoured the whole coast of the enemy, as well as any of Homer's
heroes ever did, or as Don Quixote or any knight-errant in the world
could have done, he returned to Molly, whom he found in a condition
which must give both me and my reader pain, was it to be described
here. Tom raved like a madman, beat his breast, tore his hair, stamped
on the ground, and vowed the utmost vengeance on all who had been
concerned. He then pulled off his coat, and buttoned it round her, put
his hat upon her head, wiped the blood from her face as well as he
could with his handkerchief, and called out to the servant to ride as
fast as possible for a side-saddle, or a pillion, that he might carry
her safe home.

Master Blifil objected to the sending away the servant, as they had
only one with them; but as Square seconded the order of Jones, he was
obliged to comply.

The servant returned in a very short time with the pillion, and Molly,
having collected her rags as well as she could, was placed behind him.
In which manner she was carried home, Square, Blifil, and Jones
attending.

Here Jones having received his coat, given her a sly kiss, and
whispered her, that he would return in the evening, quitted his Molly,
and rode on after his companions.



Chapter ix.

Containing matter of no very peaceable colour.


Molly had no sooner apparelled herself in her accustomed rags, than
her sisters began to fall violently upon her, particularly her eldest
sister, who told her she was well enough served. "How had she the
assurance to wear a gown which young Madam Western had given to
mother! If one of us was to wear it, I think," says she, "I myself
have the best right; but I warrant you think it belongs to your
beauty. I suppose you think yourself more handsomer than any of
us."--"Hand her down the bit of glass from over the cupboard," cries
another; "I'd wash the blood from my face before I talked of my
beauty."--"You'd better have minded what the parson says," cries the
eldest, "and not a harkened after men voke."--"Indeed, child, and so
she had," says the mother, sobbing: "she hath brought a disgrace upon
us all. She's the vurst of the vamily that ever was a whore."

"You need not upbraid me with that, mother," cries Molly; "you
yourself was brought-to-bed of sister there, within a week after you
was married."

"Yes, hussy," answered the enraged mother, "so I was, and what was the
mighty matter of that? I was made an honest woman then; and if you was
to be made an honest woman, I should not be angry; but you must have
to doing with a gentleman, you nasty slut; you will have a bastard,
hussy, you will; and that I defy any one to say of me."

In this situation Black George found his family, when he came home for
the purpose before mentioned. As his wife and three daughters were all
of them talking together, and most of them crying, it was some time
before he could get an opportunity of being heard; but as soon as such
an interval occurred, he acquainted the company with what Sophia had
said to him.

Goody Seagrim then began to revile her daughter afresh. "Here," says
she, "you have brought us into a fine quandary indeed. What will madam
say to that big belly? Oh that ever I should live to see this day!"

Molly answered with great spirit, "And what is this mighty place which
you have got for me, father?" (for he had not well understood the
phrase used by Sophia of being about her person). "I suppose it is to
be under the cook; but I shan't wash dishes for anybody. My gentleman
will provide better for me. See what he hath given me this afternoon.
He hath promised I shall never want money; and you shan't want money
neither, mother, if you will hold your tongue, and know when you are
well." And so saying, she pulled out several guineas, and gave her
mother one of them.

The good woman no sooner felt the gold within her palm, than her
temper began (such is the efficacy of that panacea) to be mollified.
"Why, husband," says she, "would any but such a blockhead as you not
have enquired what place this was before he had accepted it? Perhaps,
as Molly says, it may be in the kitchen; and truly I don't care my
daughter should be a scullion wench; for, poor as I am, I am a
gentlewoman. And thof I was obliged, as my father, who was a
clergyman, died worse than nothing, and so could not give me a
shilling of _potion_, to undervalue myself by marrying a poor man; yet
I would have you to know, I have a spirit above all them things. Marry
come up! it would better become Madam Western to look at home, and
remember who her own grandfather was. Some of my family, for aught I
know, might ride in their coaches, when the grandfathers of some voke
walked a-voot. I warrant she fancies she did a mighty matter, when she
sent us that old gownd; some of my family would not have picked up
such rags in the street; but poor people are always trampled
upon.--The parish need not have been in such a fluster with Molly. You
might have told them, child, your grandmother wore better things new
out of the shop."

"Well, but consider," cried George, "what answer shall I make to
madam?"

"I don't know what answer," says she; "you are always bringing your
family into one quandary or other. Do you remember when you shot the
partridge, the occasion of all our misfortunes? Did not I advise you
never to go into Squire Western's manor? Did not I tell you many a
good year ago what would come of it? But you would have your own
headstrong ways; yes, you would, you villain."

Black George was, in the main, a peaceable kind of fellow, and nothing
choleric nor rash; yet did he bear about him something of what the
antients called the irascible, and which his wife, if she had been
endowed with much wisdom, would have feared. He had long experienced,
that when the storm grew very high, arguments were but wind, which
served rather to increase, than to abate it. He was therefore seldom
unprovided with a small switch, a remedy of wonderful force, as he had
often essayed, and which the word villain served as a hint for his
applying.

No sooner, therefore, had this symptom appeared, than he had immediate
recourse to the said remedy, which though, as it is usual in all very
efficacious medicines, it at first seemed to heighten and inflame the
disease, soon produced a total calm, and restored the patient to
perfect ease and tranquillity.

This is, however, a kind of horse-medicine, which requires a very
robust constitution to digest, and is therefore proper only for the
vulgar, unless in one single instance, viz., where superiority of
birth breaks out; in which case, we should not think it very
improperly applied by any husband whatever, if the application was not
in itself so base, that, like certain applications of the physical
kind which need not be mentioned, it so much degrades and contaminates
the hand employed in it, that no gentleman should endure the thought
of anything so low and detestable.

The whole family were soon reduced to a state of perfect quiet; for
the virtue of this medicine, like that of electricity, is often
communicated through one person to many others, who are not touched by
the instrument. To say the truth, as they both operate by friction, it
may be doubted whether there is not something analogous between them,
of which Mr Freke would do well to enquire, before he publishes the
next edition of his book.

A council was now called, in which, after many debates, Molly still
persisting that she would not go to service, it was at length
resolved, that Goody Seagrim herself should wait on Miss Western, and
endeavour to procure the place for her eldest daughter, who declared
great readiness to accept it: but Fortune, who seems to have been an
enemy of this little family, afterwards put a stop to her promotion.



Chapter x.

A story told by Mr Supple, the curate. The penetration of Squire
Western. His great love for his daughter, and the return to it made by
her.


The next morning Tom Jones hunted with Mr Western, and was at his
return invited by that gentleman to dinner.

The lovely Sophia shone forth that day with more gaiety and
sprightliness than usual. Her battery was certainly levelled at our
heroe; though, I believe, she herself scarce yet knew her own
intention; but if she had any design of charming him, she now
succeeded.

Mr Supple, the curate of Mr Allworthy's parish, made one of the
company. He was a good-natured worthy man; but chiefly remarkable for
his great taciturnity at table, though his mouth was never shut at it.
In short, he had one of the best appetites in the world. However, the
cloth was no sooner taken away, than he always made sufficient amends
for his silence: for he was a very hearty fellow; and his conversation
was often entertaining, never offensive.

At his first arrival, which was immediately before the entrance of the
roast-beef, he had given an intimation that he had brought some news
with him, and was beginning to tell, that he came that moment from Mr
Allworthy's, when the sight of the roast-beef struck him dumb,
permitting him only to say grace, and to declare he must pay his
respect to the baronet, for so he called the sirloin.

When dinner was over, being reminded by Sophia of his news, he began
as follows: "I believe, lady, your ladyship observed a young woman at
church yesterday at even-song, who was drest in one of your outlandish
garments; I think I have seen your ladyship in such a one. However, in
the country, such dresses are

     _Rara avis in terris, nigroque simillima cygno._

That is, madam, as much as to say, 'A rare bird upon the earth, and
very like a black swan.' The verse is in Juvenal. But to return to
what I was relating. I was saying such garments are rare sights in the
country; and perchance, too, it was thought the more rare, respect
being had to the person who wore it, who, they tell me, is the
daughter of Black George, your worship's gamekeeper, whose sufferings,
I should have opined, might have taught him more wit, than to dress
forth his wenches in such gaudy apparel. She created so much confusion
in the congregation, that if Squire Allworthy had not silenced it, it
would have interrupted the service: for I was once about to stop in
the middle of the first lesson. Howbeit, nevertheless, after prayer
was over, and I was departed home, this occasioned a battle in the
churchyard, where, amongst other mischief, the head of a travelling
fidler was very much broken. This morning the fidler came to Squire
Allworthy for a warrant, and the wench was brought before him. The
squire was inclined to have compounded matters; when, lo! on a sudden
the wench appeared (I ask your ladyship's pardon) to be, as it were,
at the eve of bringing forth a bastard. The squire demanded of her who
was the father? But she pertinaciously refused to make any response.
So that he was about to make her mittimus to Bridewell when I
departed."

"And is a wench having a bastard all your news, doctor?" cries
Western; "I thought it might have been some public matter, something
about the nation."

"I am afraid it is too common, indeed," answered the parson; "but I
thought the whole story altogether deserved commemorating. As to
national matters, your worship knows them best. My concerns extend no
farther than my own parish."

"Why, ay," says the squire, "I believe I do know a little of that
matter, as you say. But, come, Tommy, drink about; the bottle stands
with you."

Tom begged to be excused, for that he had particular business; and
getting up from table, escaped the clutches of the squire, who was
rising to stop him, and went off with very little ceremony.

The squire gave him a good curse at his departure; and then turning to
the parson, he cried out, "I smoke it: I smoke it. Tom is certainly
the father of this bastard. Zooks, parson, you remember how he
recommended the veather o' her to me. D--n un, what a sly b--ch 'tis.
Ay, ay, as sure as two-pence, Tom is the veather of the bastard."

"I should be very sorry for that," says the parson.

"Why sorry," cries the squire: "Where is the mighty matter o't? What,
I suppose dost pretend that thee hast never got a bastard? Pox! more
good luck's thine? for I warrant hast a done a _therefore_ many's the
good time and often."

"Your worship is pleased to be jocular," answered the parson; "but I
do not only animadvert on the sinfulness of the action--though that
surely is to be greatly deprecated--but I fear his unrighteousness may
injure him with Mr Allworthy. And truly I must say, though he hath the
character of being a little wild, I never saw any harm in the young
man; nor can I say I have heard any, save what your worship now
mentions. I wish, indeed, he was a little more regular in his
responses at church; but altogether he seems

     _Ingenui vultus puer ingenuique pudoris._

That is a classical line, young lady; and, being rendered into
English, is, `a lad of an ingenuous countenance, and of an ingenuous
modesty;' for this was a virtue in great repute both among the Latins
and Greeks. I must say, the young gentleman (for so I think I may call
him, notwithstanding his birth) appears to me a very modest, civil
lad, and I should be sorry that he should do himself any injury in
Squire Allworthy's opinion."

"Poogh!" says the squire: "Injury, with Allworthy! Why, Allworthy
loves a wench himself. Doth not all the country know whose son Tom is?
You must talk to another person in that manner. I remember Allworthy
at college."

"I thought," said the parson, "he had never been at the university."

"Yes, yes, he was," says the squire: "and many a wench have we two had
together. As arrant a whore-master as any within five miles o'un. No,
no. It will do'n no harm with he, assure yourself; nor with anybody
else. Ask Sophy there--You have not the worse opinion of a young
fellow for getting a bastard, have you, girl? No, no, the women will
like un the better for't."

This was a cruel question to poor Sophia. She had observed Tom's
colour change at the parson's story; and that, with his hasty and
abrupt departure, gave her sufficient reason to think her father's
suspicion not groundless. Her heart now at once discovered the great
secret to her which it had been so long disclosing by little and
little; and she found herself highly interested in this matter. In
such a situation, her father's malapert question rushing suddenly upon
her, produced some symptoms which might have alarmed a suspicious
heart; but, to do the squire justice, that was not his fault. When she
rose therefore from her chair, and told him a hint from him was always
sufficient to make her withdraw, he suffered her to leave the room,
and then with great gravity of countenance remarked, "That it was
better to see a daughter over-modest than over-forward;"--a sentiment
which was highly applauded by the parson.

There now ensued between the squire and the parson a most excellent
political discourse, framed out of newspapers and political pamphlets;
in which they made a libation of four bottles of wine to the good of
their country: and then, the squire being fast asleep, the parson
lighted his pipe, mounted his horse, and rode home.

When the squire had finished his half-hour's nap, he summoned his
daughter to her harpsichord; but she begged to be excused that
evening, on account of a violent head-ache. This remission was
presently granted; for indeed she seldom had occasion to ask him
twice, as he loved her with such ardent affection, that, by gratifying
her, he commonly conveyed the highest gratification to himself. She
was really, what he frequently called her, his little darling, and she
well deserved to be so; for she returned all his affection in the most
ample manner. She had preserved the most inviolable duty to him in all
things; and this her love made not only easy, but so delightful, that
when one of her companions laughed at her for placing so much merit in
such scrupulous obedience, as that young lady called it, Sophia
answered, "You mistake me, madam, if you think I value myself upon
this account; for besides that I am barely discharging my duty, I am
likewise pleasing myself. I can truly say I have no delight equal to
that of contributing to my father's happiness; and if I value myself,
my dear, it is on having this power, and not on executing it."

This was a satisfaction, however, which poor Sophia was incapable of
tasting this evening. She therefore not only desired to be excused
from her attendance at the harpsichord, but likewise begged that he
would suffer her to absent herself from supper. To this request
likewise the squire agreed, though not without some reluctance; for he
scarce ever permitted her to be out of his sight, unless when he was
engaged with his horses, dogs, or bottle. Nevertheless he yielded to
the desire of his daughter, though the poor man was at the same time
obliged to avoid his own company (if I may so express myself), by
sending for a neighbouring farmer to sit with him.



Chapter xi.

The narrow escape of Molly Seagrim, with some observations for which
we have been forced to dive pretty deep into nature.


Tom Jones had ridden one of Mr Western's horses that morning in the
chase; so that having no horse of his own in the squire's stable, he
was obliged to go home on foot: this he did so expeditiously that he
ran upwards of three miles within the half-hour.

Just as he arrived at Mr Allworthy's outward gate, he met the
constable and company with Molly in their possession, whom they were
conducting to that house where the inferior sort of people may learn
one good lesson, viz., respect and deference to their superiors; since
it must show them the wide distinction Fortune intends between those
persons who are to be corrected for their faults, and those who are
not; which lesson if they do not learn, I am afraid they very rarely
learn any other good lesson, or improve their morals, at the house of
correction.

A lawyer may perhaps think Mr Allworthy exceeded his authority a
little in this instance. And, to say the truth, I question, as here
was no regular information before him, whether his conduct was
strictly regular. However, as his intention was truly upright, he
ought to be excused in _foro conscientiae_; since so many arbitrary
acts are daily committed by magistrates who have not this excuse to
plead for themselves.

Tom was no sooner informed by the constable whither they were
proceeding (indeed he pretty well guessed it of himself), than he
caught Molly in his arms, and embracing her tenderly before them all,
swore he would murder the first man who offered to lay hold of her. He
bid her dry her eyes and be comforted; for, wherever she went, he
would accompany her. Then turning to the constable, who stood
trembling with his hat off, he desired him, in a very mild voice, to
return with him for a moment only to his father (for so he now called
Allworthy); for he durst, he said, be assured, that, when he had
alledged what he had to say in her favour, the girl would be
discharged.

The constable, who, I make no doubt, would have surrendered his
prisoner had Tom demanded her, very readily consented to this request.
So back they all went into Mr Allworthy's hall; where Tom desired them
to stay till his return, and then went himself in pursuit of the good
man. As soon as he was found, Tom threw himself at his feet, and
having begged a patient hearing, confessed himself to be the father of
the child of which Molly was then big. He entreated him to have
compassion on the poor girl, and to consider, if there was any guilt
in the case, it lay principally at his door.

"If there is any guilt in the case!" answered Allworthy warmly: "Are
you then so profligate and abandoned a libertine to doubt whether the
breaking the laws of God and man, the corrupting and ruining a poor
girl be guilt? I own, indeed, it doth lie principally upon you; and so
heavy it is, that you ought to expect it should crush you."

"Whatever may be my fate," says Tom, "let me succeed in my
intercessions for the poor girl. I confess I have corrupted her! but
whether she shall be ruined, depends on you. For Heaven's sake, sir,
revoke your warrant, and do not send her to a place which must
unavoidably prove her destruction."

Allworthy bid him immediately call a servant. Tom answered there was
no occasion; for he had luckily met them at the gate, and relying upon
his goodness, had brought them all back into his hall, where they now
waited his final resolution, which upon his knees he besought him
might be in favour of the girl; that she might be permitted to go home
to her parents, and not be exposed to a greater degree of shame and
scorn than must necessarily fall upon her. "I know," said he, "that is
too much. I know I am the wicked occasion of it. I will endeavour to
make amends, if possible; and if you shall have hereafter the goodness
to forgive me, I hope I shall deserve it."

Allworthy hesitated some time, and at last said, "Well, I will
discharge my mittimus.--You may send the constable to me." He was
instantly called, discharged, and so was the girl.

It will be believed that Mr Allworthy failed not to read Tom a very
severe lecture on this occasion; but it is unnecessary to insert it
here, as we have faithfully transcribed what he said to Jenny Jones in
the first book, most of which may be applied to the men, equally with
the women. So sensible an effect had these reproofs on the young man,
who was no hardened sinner, that he retired to his own room, where he
passed the evening alone, in much melancholy contemplation.

Allworthy was sufficiently offended by this transgression of Jones;
for notwithstanding the assertions of Mr Western, it is certain this
worthy man had never indulged himself in any loose pleasures with
women, and greatly condemned the vice of incontinence in others.
Indeed, there is much reason to imagine that there was not the least
truth in what Mr Western affirmed, especially as he laid the scene of
those impurities at the university, where Mr Allworthy had never been.
In fact, the good squire was a little too apt to indulge that kind of
pleasantry which is generally called rhodomontade: but which may, with
as much propriety, be expressed by a much shorter word; and perhaps we
too often supply the use of this little monosyllable by others; since
very much of what frequently passes in the world for wit and humour,
should, in the strictest purity of language, receive that short
appellation, which, in conformity to the well-bred laws of custom, I
here suppress.

But whatever detestation Mr Allworthy had to this or to any other
vice, he was not so blinded by it but that he could discern any virtue
in the guilty person, as clearly indeed as if there had been no
mixture of vice in the same character. While he was angry therefore
with the incontinence of Jones, he was no less pleased with the honour
and honesty of his self-accusation. He began now to form in his mind
the same opinion of this young fellow, which, we hope, our reader may
have conceived. And in balancing his faults with his perfections, the
latter seemed rather to preponderate.

It was to no purpose, therefore, that Thwackum, who was immediately
charged by Mr Blifil with the story, unbended all his rancour against
poor Tom. Allworthy gave a patient hearing to their invectives, and
then answered coldly: "That young men of Tom's complexion were too
generally addicted to this vice; but he believed that youth was
sincerely affected with what he had said to him on the occasion, and
he hoped he would not transgress again." So that, as the days of
whipping were at an end, the tutor had no other vent but his own mouth
for his gall, the usual poor resource of impotent revenge.

But Square, who was a less violent, was a much more artful man; and as
he hated Jones more perhaps than Thwackum himself did, so he contrived
to do him more mischief in the mind of Mr Allworthy.

The reader must remember the several little incidents of the
partridge, the horse, and the Bible, which were recounted in the
second book. By all which Jones had rather improved than injured the
affection which Mr Allworthy was inclined to entertain for him. The
same, I believe, must have happened to him with every other person who
hath any idea of friendship, generosity, and greatness of spirit, that
is to say, who hath any traces of goodness in his mind.

Square himself was not unacquainted with the true impression which
those several instances of goodness had made on the excellent heart of
Allworthy; for the philosopher very well knew what virtue was, though
he was not always perhaps steady in its pursuit; but as for Thwackum,
from what reason I will not determine, no such thoughts ever entered
into his head: he saw Jones in a bad light, and he imagined Allworthy
saw him in the same, but that he was resolved, from pride and
stubbornness of spirit, not to give up the boy whom he had once
cherished; since by so doing, he must tacitly acknowledge that his
former opinion of him had been wrong.

Square therefore embraced this opportunity of injuring Jones
in the tenderest part, by giving a very bad turn to all these
before-mentioned occurrences. "I am sorry, sir," said he, "to own I
have been deceived as well as yourself. I could not, I confess, help
being pleased with what I ascribed to the motive of friendship, though
it was carried to an excess, and all excess is faulty and vicious: but
in this I made allowance for youth. Little did I suspect that the
sacrifice of truth, which we both imagined to have been made to
friendship, was in reality a prostitution of it to a depraved and
debauched appetite. You now plainly see whence all the seeming
generosity of this young man to the family of the gamekeeper
proceeded. He supported the father in order to corrupt the daughter,
and preserved the family from starving, to bring one of them to shame
and ruin. This is friendship! this is generosity! As Sir Richard
Steele says, `Gluttons who give high prices for delicacies, are very
worthy to be called generous.' In short I am resolved, from this
instance, never to give way to the weakness of human nature more, nor
to think anything virtue which doth not exactly quadrate with the
unerring rule of right."

The goodness of Allworthy had prevented those considerations from
occurring to himself; yet were they too plausible to be absolutely and
hastily rejected, when laid before his eyes by another. Indeed what
Square had said sunk very deeply into his mind, and the uneasiness
which it there created was very visible to the other; though the good
man would not acknowledge this, but made a very slight answer, and
forcibly drove off the discourse to some other subject. It was well
perhaps for poor Tom, that no such suggestions had been made before he
was pardoned; for they certainly stamped in the mind of Allworthy the
first bad impression concerning Jones.



Chapter xii.

Containing much clearer matters; but which flowed from the same
fountain with those in the preceding chapter.


The reader will be pleased, I believe, to return with me to Sophia.
She passed the night, after we saw her last, in no very agreeable
manner. Sleep befriended her but little, and dreams less. In the
morning, when Mrs Honour, her maid, attended her at the usual hour,
she was found already up and drest.

Persons who live two or three miles' distance in the country are
considered as next-door neighbours, and transactions at the one house
fly with incredible celerity to the other. Mrs Honour, therefore, had
heard the whole story of Molly's shame; which she, being of a very
communicative temper, had no sooner entered the apartment of her
mistress, than she began to relate in the following manner:--

"La, ma'am, what doth your la'ship think? the girl that your la'ship
saw at church on Sunday, whom you thought so handsome; though you
would not have thought her so handsome neither, if you had seen her
nearer, but to be sure she hath been carried before the justice for
being big with child. She seemed to me to look like a confident slut:
and to be sure she hath laid the child to young Mr Jones. And all the
parish says Mr Allworthy is so angry with young Mr Jones, that he
won't see him. To be sure, one can't help pitying the poor young man,
and yet he doth not deserve much pity neither, for demeaning himself
with such kind of trumpery. Yet he is so pretty a gentleman, I should
be sorry to have him turned out of doors. I dares to swear the wench
was as willing as he; for she was always a forward kind of body. And
when wenches are so coming, young men are not so much to be blamed
neither; for to be sure they do no more than what is natural. Indeed
it is beneath them to meddle with such dirty draggle-tails; and
whatever happens to them, it is good enough for them. And yet, to be
sure, the vile baggages are most in fault. I wishes, with all my
heart, they were well to be whipped at the cart's tail; for it is pity
they should be the ruin of a pretty young gentleman; and nobody can
deny but that Mr Jones is one of the most handsomest young men that
ever----"

She was running on thus, when Sophia, with a more peevish voice than
she had ever spoken to her in before, cried, "Prithee, why dost thou
trouble me with all this stuff? What concern have I in what Mr Jones
doth? I suppose you are all alike. And you seem to me to be angry it
was not your own case."

"I, ma'am!" answered Mrs Honour, "I am sorry your ladyship should have
such an opinion of me. I am sure nobody can say any such thing of me.
All the young fellows in the world may go to the divil for me. Because
I said he was a handsome man? Everybody says it as well as I. To be
sure, I never thought as it was any harm to say a young man was
handsome; but to be sure I shall never think him so any more now; for
handsome is that handsome does. A beggar wench!--"

"Stop thy torrent of impertinence," cries Sophia, "and see whether my
father wants me at breakfast."

Mrs Honour then flung out of the room, muttering much to herself, of
which "Marry come up, I assure you," was all that could be plainly
distinguished.

Whether Mrs Honour really deserved that suspicion, of which her
mistress gave her a hint, is a matter which we cannot indulge our
reader's curiosity by resolving. We will, however, make him amends in
disclosing what passed in the mind of Sophia.

The reader will be pleased to recollect, that a secret affection for
Mr Jones had insensibly stolen into the bosom of this young lady. That
it had there grown to a pretty great height before she herself had
discovered it. When she first began to perceive its symptoms, the
sensations were so sweet and pleasing, that she had not resolution
sufficient to check or repel them; and thus she went on cherishing a
passion of which she never once considered the consequences.

This incident relating to Molly first opened her eyes. She now first
perceived the weakness of which she had been guilty; and though it
caused the utmost perturbation in her mind, yet it had the effect of
other nauseous physic, and for the time expelled her distemper. Its
operation indeed was most wonderfully quick; and in the short
interval, while her maid was absent, so entirely removed all symptoms,
that when Mrs Honour returned with a summons from her father, she was
become perfectly easy, and had brought herself to a thorough
indifference for Mr Jones.

The diseases of the mind do in almost every particular imitate those
of the body. For which reason, we hope, that learned faculty, for whom
we have so profound a respect, will pardon us the violent hands we
have been necessitated to lay on several words and phrases, which of
right belong to them, and without which our descriptions must have
been often unintelligible.

Now there is no one circumstance in which the distempers of the mind
bear a more exact analogy to those which are called bodily, than that
aptness which both have to a relapse. This is plain in the violent
diseases of ambition and avarice. I have known ambition, when cured at
court by frequent disappointments (which are the only physic for it),
to break out again in a contest for foreman of the grand jury at an
assizes; and have heard of a man who had so far conquered avarice, as
to give away many a sixpence, that comforted himself, at last, on his
deathbed, by making a crafty and advantageous bargain concerning his
ensuing funeral, with an undertaker who had married his only child.

In the affair of love, which, out of strict conformity with the Stoic
philosophy, we shall here treat as a disease, this proneness to
relapse is no less conspicuous. Thus it happened to poor Sophia; upon
whom, the very next time she saw young Jones, all the former symptoms
returned, and from that time cold and hot fits alternately seized her
heart.

The situation of this young lady was now very different from what it
had ever been before. That passion which had formerly been so
exquisitely delicious, became now a scorpion in her bosom. She
resisted it therefore with her utmost force, and summoned every
argument her reason (which was surprisingly strong for her age) could
suggest, to subdue and expel it. In this she so far succeeded, that
she began to hope from time and absence a perfect curf an arm or a leg. I assure
you, sir, I was never less afraid in my life; and so, if your honour
is resolved to go on, I am resolved to follow you. But, in that case,
I wish I might give my opinion. To be sure, it is a scandalous way of
travelling, for a great gentleman like you to walk afoot. Now here are
two or three good horses in the stable, which the landlord will
certainly make no scruple of trusting you with; but, if he should, I
can easily contrive to take them; and, let the worst come to the
worst, the king would certainly pardon you, as you are going to fight
in his cause."

Now, as the honesty of Partridge was equal to his understanding, and
both dealt only in small matters, he would never have attempted a
roguery of this kind, had he not imagined it altogether safe; for he
was one of those who have more consideration of the gallows than of
the fitness of things; but, in reality, he thought he might have
committed this felony without any danger; for, besides that he doubted
not but the name of Mr Allworthy would sufficiently quiet the
landlord, he conceived they should be altogether safe, whatever turn
affairs might take; as Jones, he imagined, would have friends enough
on one side, and as his friends would as well secure him on the other.

When Mr Jones found that Partridge was in earnest in this proposal, he
very severely rebuked him, and that in such bitter terms, that the
other attempted to laugh it off, and presently turned the discourse to
other matters; saying, he believed they were then in a bawdy house,
and that he had with much ado prevented two wenches from disturbing
his honour in the middle of the night. "Heyday!" says he, "I believe
they got into your chamber whether I would or no; for here lies the
muff of one of them on the ground." Indeed, as Jones returned to his
bed in the dark, he had never perceived the muff on the quilt, and, in
leaping into his bed, he had tumbled it on the floor. This Partridge
now took up, and was going to put into his pocket, when Jones desired
to see it. The muff was so very remarkable, that our heroe might
possibly have recollected it without the information annexed. But his
memory was not put to that hard office; for at the same instant he saw
and read the words Sophia Western upon the paper which was pinned to
it. His looks now grew frantic in a moment, and he eagerly cried out,
"Oh Heavens! how came this muff here?" "I know no more than your
honour," cried Partridge; "but I saw it upon the arm of one of the
women who would have disturbed you, if I would have suffered them."
"Where are they?" cries Jones, jumping out of bed, and laying hold of
his cloaths. "Many miles off, I believe, by this time," said
Partridge. And now Jones, upon further enquiry, was sufficiently
assured that the bearer of this muff was no other than the lovely
Sophia herself.

The behaviour of Jones on this occasion, his thoughts, his looks, his
words, his actions, were such as beggar all description. After many
bitter execrations on Partridge, and not fewer on himself, he ordered
the poor fellow, who was frightened out of his wits, to run down and
hire him horses at any rate; and a very few minutes afterwards, having
shuffled on his clothes, he hastened down-stairs to execute the orders
himself, which he had just before given.

But before we proceed to what passed on his arrival in the kitchen, it
will be necessary to recur to what had there happened since Partridge
had first left it on his master's summons.

The serjeant was just marched off with his party, when the two Irish
gentlemen arose, and came downstairs; both complaining that they had
been so often waked by the noises in the inn, that they had never once
been able to close their eyes all night.

The coach which had brought the young lady and her maid, and which,
perhaps, the reader may have hitherto concluded was her own, was,
indeed, a returned coach belonging to Mr King, of Bath, one of the
worthiest and honestest men that ever dealt in horse-flesh, and whose
coaches we heartily recommend to all our readers who travel that road.
By which means they may, perhaps, have the pleasure of riding in the
very coach, and being driven by the very coachman, that is recorded in
this history.

The coachman, having but two passengers, and hearing Mr Maclachlan was
going to Bath, offered to carry him thither at a very moderate price.
He was induced to this by the report of the hostler, who said that the
horse which Mr Maclachlan had hired from Worcester would be much more
pleased with returning to his friends there than to prosecute a long
journey; for that the said horse was rather a two-legged than a
four-legged animal.

Mr Maclachlan immediately closed with the proposal of the coachman,
and, at the same time, persuaded his friend Fitzpatrick to accept of
the fourth place in the coach. This conveyance the soreness of his
bones made more agreeable to him than a horse; and, being well assured
of meeting with his wife at Bath, he thought a little delay would be
of no consequence.

Maclachlan, who was much the sharper man of the two, no sooner heard
that this lady came from Chester, with the other circumstances which
he learned from the hostler, than it came into his head that she might
possibly be his friend's wife; and presently acquainted him with this
suspicion, which had never once occurred to Fitzpatrick himself. To
say the truth, he was one of those compositions which nature makes up
in too great a hurry, and forgets to put any brains into their head.

Now it happens to this sort of men, as to bad hounds, who never hit
off a fault themselves; but no sooner doth a dog of sagacity open his
mouth than they immediately do the same, and, without the guidance of
any scent, run directly forwards as fast as they are able. In the same
manner, the very moment Mr Maclachlan had mentioned his apprehension,
Mr Fitzpatrick instantly concurred, and flew directly up-stairs, to
surprize his wife, before he knew where she was; and unluckily (as
Fortune loves to play tricks with those gentlemen who put themselves
entirely under her conduct) ran his head against several doors and
posts to no purpose. Much kinder was she to me, when she suggested
that simile of the hounds, just before inserted; since the poor wife
may, on these occasions, be so justly compared to a hunted hare. Like
that little wretched animal, she pricks up her ears to listen after
the voice of her pursuer; like her, flies away trembling when she
hears it; and, like her, is generally overtaken and destroyed in the
end.

This was not however the case at present; for after a long fruitless
search, Mr Fitzpatrick returned to the kitchen, where, as if this had
been a real chace, entered a gentleman hallowing as hunters do when
the hounds are at a fault. He was just alighted from his horse, and
had many attendants at his heels.

Here, reader, it may be necessary to acquaint thee with some matters,
which, if thou dost know already, thou art wiser than I take thee to
be. And this information thou shalt receive in the next chapter.



Chapter vii.

In which are concluded the adventures that happened at the inn at
Upton.


In the first place, then, this gentleman just arrived was no other
person than Squire Western himself, who was come hither in pursuit of
his daughter; and, had he fortunately been two hours earlier, he had
not only found her, but his niece into the bargain; for such was the
wife of Mr Fitzpatrick, who had run away with her five years before,
out of the custody of that sage lady, Madam Western.

Now this lady had departed from the inn much about the same time with
Sophia; for, having been waked by the voice of her husband, she had
sent up for the landlady, and being by her apprized of the matter, had
bribed the good woman, at an extravagant price, to furnish her with
horses for her escape. Such prevalence had money in this family; and
though the mistress would have turned away her maid for a corrupt
hussy, if she had known as much as the reader, yet she was no more
proof against corruption herself than poor Susan had been.

Mr Western and his nephew were not known to one another; nor indeed
would the former have taken any notice of the latter if he had known
him; for, this being a stolen match, and consequently an unnatural one
in the opinion of the good squire, he had, from the time of her
committing it, abandoned the poor young creature, who was then no more
than eighteen, as a monster, and had never since suffered her to be
named in his presence.

The kitchen was now a scene of universal confusion, Western enquiring
after his daughter, and Fitzpatrick as eagerly after his wife, when
Jones entered the room, unfortunately having Sophia's muff in his
hand.

As soon as Western saw Jones, he set up the same holla as is used by
sportsmen when their game is in view. He then immediately run up and
laid hold of Jones, crying, "We have got the dog fox, I warrant the
bitch is not far off." The jargon which followed for some minutes,
where many spoke different things at the same time, as it would be
very difficult to describe, so would it be no less unpleasant to read.

Jones having, at length, shaken Mr Western off, and some of the
company having interfered between them, our heroe protested his
innocence as to knowing anything of the lady; when Parson Supple
stepped up, and said, "It is folly to deny it; for why, the marks of
guilt are in thy hands. I will myself asseverate and bind it by an
oath, that the muff thou bearest in thy hand belongeth unto Madam
Sophia; for I have frequently observed her, of later days, to bear it
about her." "My daughter's muff!" cries the squire in a rage. "Hath he
got my daughter's muff? bear witness the goods are found upon him.
I'll have him before a justice of peace this instant. Where is my
daughter, villain?" "Sir," said Jones, "I beg you would be pacified.
The muff, I acknowledge, is the young lady's; but, upon my honour, I
have never seen her." At these words Western lost all patience, and
grew inarticulate with rage.

Some of the servants had acquainted Fitzpatrick who Mr Western was.
The good Irishman, therefore, thinking he had now an opportunity to do
an act of service to his uncle, and by that means might possibly
obtain his favour, stept up to Jones, and cried out, "Upon my
conscience, sir, you may be ashamed of denying your having seen the
gentleman's daughter before my face, when you know I found you there
upon the bed together." Then, turning to Western, he offered to
conduct him immediately to the room where his daughter was; which
offer being accepted, he, the squire, the parson, and some others,
ascended directly to Mrs Waters's chamber, which they entered with no
less violence than Mr Fitzpatrick had done before.

The poor lady started from her sleep with as much amazement as terror,
and beheld at her bedside a figure which might very well be supposed
to have escaped out of Bedlam. Such wildness and confusion were in the
looks of Mr Western; who no sooner saw the lady than he started back,
shewing sufficiently by his manner, before he spoke, that this was not
the person sought after.

So much more tenderly do women value their reputation than their
persons, that, though the latter seemed now in more danger than
before, yet, as the former was secure, the lady screamed not with such
violence as she had done on the other occasion. However, she no sooner
found herself alone than she abandoned all thoughts of further repose;
and, as she had sufficient reason to be dissatisfied with her present
lodging, she dressed herself with all possible expedition.

Mr Western now proceeded to search the whole house, but to as little
purpose as he had disturbed poor Mrs Waters. He then returned
disconsolate into the kitchen, where he found Jones in the custody of
his servants.

This violent uproar had raised all the people in the house, though it
was yet scarcely daylight. Among these was a grave gentleman, who had
the honour to be in the commission of the peace for the county of
Worcester. Of which Mr Western was no sooner informed than he offered
to lay his complaint before him. The justice declined executing his
office, as he said he had no clerk present, nor no book about justice
business; and that he could not carry all the law in his head about
stealing away daughters, and such sort of things.

Here Mr Fitzpatrick offered to lend him his assistance, informing the
company that he had been himself bred to the law. (And indeed he had
served three years as clerk to an attorney in the north of Ireland,
when, chusing a genteeler walk in life, he quitted his master, came
over to England, and set up that business which requires no
apprenticeship, namely, that of a gentleman, in which he had
succeeded, as hath been already partly mentioned.)

Mr Fitzpatrick declared that the law concerning daughters was out of
the present case; that stealing a muff was undoubtedly felony, and the
goods being found upon the person, were sufficient evidence of the
fact.

The magistrate, upon the encouragement of so learned a coadjutor, and
upon the violent intercession of the squire, was at length prevailed
upon to seat himself in the chair of justice, where being placed, upon
viewing the muff which Jones still held in his hand, and upon the
parson's swearing it to be the property of Mr Western, he desired Mr
Fitzpatrick to draw up a commitment, which he said he would sign.

Jones now desired to be heard, which was at last, with difficulty,
granted him. He then produced the evidence of Mr Partridge, as to the
finding it; but, what was still more, Susan deposed that Sophia
herself had delivered the muff to her, and had ordered her to convey
it into the chamber where Mr Jones had found it.

Whether a natural love of justice, or the extraordinary comeliness of
Jones, had wrought on Susan to make the discovery, I will not
determine; but such were the effects of her evidence, that the
magistrate, throwing himself back in his chair, declared that the
matter was now altogether as clear on the side of the prisoner as it
had before been against him: with which the parson concurred, saying,
the Lord forbid he should be instrumental in committing an innocent
person to durance. The justice then arose, acquitted the prisoner, and
broke up the court.

Mr Western now gave every one present a hearty curse, and, immediately
ordering his horses, departed in pursuit of his daughter, without
taking the least notice of his nephew Fitzpatrick, or returning any
answer to his claim of kindred, notwithstanding all the obligations he
had just received from that gentleman. In the violence, moreover, of
his hurry, and of his passion, he luckily forgot to demand the muff of
Jones: I say luckily; for he would have died on the spot rather than
have parted with it.

Jones likewise, with his friend Partridge, set forward the moment he
had paid his reckoning, in quest of his lovely Sophia, whom he now
resolved never more to abandon the pursuit of. Nor could he bring
himself even to take leave of Mrs Waters; of whom he detested the very
thoughts, as she had been, though not designedly, the occasion of his
missing the happiest interview with Sophia, to whom he now vowed
eternal constancy.

As for Mrs Waters, she took the opportunity of the coach which was
going to Bath; for which place she set out in company with the two
Irish gentlemen, the landlady kindly lending her her cloaths; in
return for which she was contented only to receive about double their
value, as a recompence for the loan. Upon the road she was perfectly
reconciled to Mr Fitzpatrick, who was a very handsome fellow, and
indeed did all she could to console him in the absence of his wife.

Thus ended the many odd adventures which Mr Jones encountered at his
inn at Upton, where they talk, to this day, of the beauty and lovely
behaviour of the charming Sophia, by the name of the Somersetshire
angel.



Chapter viii.

In which the history goes backward.


Before we proceed any farther in our history, it may be proper to look
a little back, in order to account for the extraordinary appearance of
Sophia and her father at the inn at Upton.

The reader may be pleased to remember that, in the ninth chapter of
the seventh book of our history, we left Sophia, after a long debate
between love and duty, deciding the cause, as it usually, I believe,
happens, in favour of the former.

This debate had arisen, as we have there shown, from a visit which her
father had just before made her, in order to force her consent to a
marriage with Blifil; and which he had understood to be fully implied
in her acknowledgment "that she neither must nor could refuse any
absolute command of his."

Now from this visit the squire retired to his evening potation,
overjoyed at the success he had gained with his daughter; and, as he
was of a social disposition, and willing to have partakers in his
happiness, the beer was ordered to flow very liberally into the
kitchen; so that before eleven in the evening there was not a single
person sober in the house except only Mrs Western herself and the
charming Sophia.

Early in the morning a messenger was despatched to summon Mr Blifil;
for, though the squire imagined that young gentleman had been much
less acquainted than he really was with the former aversion of his
daughter, as he had not, however, yet received her consent, he longed
impatiently to communicate it to him, not doubting but that the
intended bride herself would confirm it with her lips. As to the
wedding, it had the evening before been fixed, by the male parties, to
be celebrated on the next morning save one.

Breakfast was now set forth in the parlour, where Mr Blifil attended,
and where the squire and his sister likewise were assembled; and now
Sophia was ordered to be called.

O, Shakespear! had I thy pen! O, Hogarth! had I thy pencil! then would
I draw the picture of the poor serving-man, who, with pale
countenance, staring eyes, chattering teeth, faultering tongue, and
trembling limbs,

     (E'en such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
     So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
     Drew Priam's curtains in the dead of night,
     And would have told him, half his Troy was burn'd)

entered the room, and declared--That Madam Sophia was not to be found.

"Not to be found!" cries the squire, starting from his chair; "Zounds
and d--nation! Blood and fury! Where, when, how, what--Not to be
found! Where?"

"La! brother," said Mrs Western, with true political coldness, "you
are always throwing yourself into such violent passions for nothing.
My niece, I suppose, is only walked out into the garden. I protest you
are grown so unreasonable, that it is impossible to live in the house
with you."

"Nay, nay," answered the squire, returning as suddenly to himself, as
he had gone from himself; "if that be all the matter, it signifies not
much; but, upon my soul, my mind misgave me when the fellow said she
was not to be found." He then gave orders for the bell to be rung in
the garden, and sat himself contentedly down.

No two things could be more the reverse of each other than were the
brother and sister in most instances; particularly in this, That as
the brother never foresaw anything at a distance, but was most
sagacious in immediately seeing everything the moment it had happened;
so the sister eternally foresaw at a distance, but was not so
quick-sighted to objects before her eyes. Of both these the reader may
have observed examples: and, indeed, both their several talents were
excessive; for, as the sister often foresaw what never came to pass,
so the brother often saw much more than was actually the truth.

This was not however the case at present. The same report was brought
from the garden as before had been brought from the chamber, that
Madam Sophia was not to be found.

The squire himself now sallied forth, and began to roar forth the name
of Sophia as loudly, and in as hoarse a voice, as whilome did Hercules
that of Hylas; and, as the poet tells us that the whole shore echoed
back the name of that beautiful youth, so did the house, the garden,
and all the neighbouring fields resound nothing but the name of
Sophia, in the hoarse voices of the men, and in the shrill pipes of
the women; while echo seemed so pleased to repeat the beloved sound,
that, if there is really such a person, I believe Ovid hath belied her
sex.

Nothing reigned for a long time but confusion; till at last the
squire, having sufficiently spent his breath, returned to the parlour,
where he found Mrs Western and Mr Blifil, and threw himself, with the
utmost dejection in his countenance, into a great chair.

Here Mrs Western began to apply the following consolation:

"Brother, I am sorry for what hath happened; and that my niece should
have behaved herself in a manner so unbecoming her family; but it is
all your own doings, and you have nobody to thank but yourself. You
know she hath been educated always in a manner directly contrary to my
advice, and now you see the consequence. Have I not a thousand times
argued with you about giving my niece her own will? But you know I
never could prevail upon you; and when I had taken so much pains to
eradicate her headstrong opinions, and to rectify your errors in
policy, you know she was taken out of my hands; so that I have nothing
to answer for. Had I been trusted entirely with the care of her
education, no such accident as this had ever befallen you; so that you
must comfort yourself by thinking it was all your own doing; and,
indeed, what else could be expected from such indulgence?"

"Zounds! sister," answered he, "you are enough to make one mad. Have I
indulged her? Have I given her her will?----It was no longer ago than
last night that I threatened, if she disobeyed me, to confine her to
her chamber upon bread and water as long as she lived.----You would
provoke the patience of Job."

"Did ever mortal hear the like?" replied she. "Brother, if I had not
the patience of fifty Jobs, you would make me forget all decency and
decorum. Why would you interfere? Did I not beg you, did I not intreat
you, to leave the whole conduct to me? You have defeated all the
operations of the campaign by one false step. Would any man in his
senses have provoked a daughter by such threats as these? How often
have I told you that English women are not to be treated like
Ciracessian[*] slaves. We have the protection of the world; we are to
be won by gentle means only, and not to be hectored, and bullied, and
beat into compliance. I thank Heaven no Salique law governs here.
Brother, you have a roughness in your manner which no woman but myself
would bear. I do not wonder my niece was frightened and terrified into
taking this measure; and, to speak honestly, I think my niece will be
justified to the world for what she hath done. I repeat it to you
again, brother, you must comfort yourself by rememb'ring that it is
all your own fault. How often have I advised--" Here Western rose
hastily from his chair, and, venting two or three horrid imprecations,
ran out of the room.

  [*] Possibly Circassian.

When he was departed, his sister expressed more bitterness (if
possible) against him than she had done while he was present; for the
truth of which she appealed to Mr Blifil, who, with great complacence,
acquiesced entirely in all she said; but excused all the faults of Mr
Western, "as they must be considered," he said, "to have proceeded
from the too inordinate fondness of a father, which must be allowed
the name of an amiable weakness." "So much the more inexcuseable,"
answered the lady; "for whom doth he ruin by his fondness but his own
child?" To which Blifil immediately agreed.

Mrs Western then began to express great confusion on the account of Mr
Blifil, and of the usage which he had received from a family to which
he intended so much honour. On this subject she treated the folly of
her niece with great severity; but concluded with throwing the whole
on her brother, who, she said, was inexcuseable to have proceeded so
far without better assurances of his daughter's consent: "But he was
(says she) always of a violent, headstrong temper; and I can scarce
forgive myself for all the advice I have thrown away upon him."

After much of this kind of conversation, which, perhaps, would not
greatly entertain the reader, was it here particularly related, Mr
Blifil took his leave and returned home, not highly pleased with his
disappointment: which, however, the philosophy which he had acquired
from Square, and the religion infused into him by Thwackum, together
with somewhat else, taught him to bear rather better than more
passionate lovers bear these kinds of evils.



Chapter ix.

The escape of Sophia.


It is now time to look after Sophia; whom the reader, if he loves her
half so well as I do, will rejoice to find escaped from the clutches
of her passionate father, and from those of her dispassionate lover.

Twelve times did the iron register of time beat on the sonorous
bell-metal, summoning the ghosts to rise and walk their nightly
round.----In plainer language, it was twelve o'clock, and all the
family, as we have said, lay buried in drink and sleep, except only
Mrs Western, who was deeply engaged in reading a political pamphlet,
and except our heroine, who now softly stole down-stairs, and, having
unbarred and unlocked one of the house-doors, sallied forth, and
hastened to the place of appointment.

Notwithstanding the many pretty arts which ladies sometimes practise,
to display their fears on every little occasion (almost as many as the
other sex uses to conceal theirs), certainly there is a degree of
courage which not only becomes a woman, but is often necessary to
enable her to discharge her duty. It is, indeed, the idea of
fierceness, and not of bravery, which destroys the female character;
for who can read the story of the justly celebrated Arria without
conceiving as high an opinion of her gentleness and tenderness as of
her fortitude? At the same time, perhaps, many a woman who shrieks at
a mouse, or a rat, may be capable of poisoning a husband; or, what is
worse, of driving him to poison himself.

Sophia, with all the gentleness which a woman can have, had all the
spirit which she ought to have. When, therefore, she came to the place
of appointment, and, instead of meeting her maid, as was agreed, saw a
man ride directly up to her, she neither screamed out nor fainted
away: not that her pulse then beat with its usual regularity; for she
was, at first, under some surprize and apprehension: but these were
relieved almost as soon as raised, when the man, pulling off his hat,
asked her, in a very submissive manner, "If her ladyship did not
expect to meet another lady?" and then proceeded to inform her that he
was sent to conduct her to that lady.

Sophia could have no possible suspicion of any falsehood in this
account: she therefore mounted resolutely behind the fellow, who
conveyed her safe to a town about five miles distant, where she had
the satisfaction of finding the good Mrs Honour: for, as the soul of
the waiting-woman was wrapt up in those very habiliments which used to
enwrap her body, she could by no means bring herself to trust them out
of her sight. Upon these, therefore, she kept guard in person, while
she detached the aforesaid fellow after her mistress, having given him
all proper instructions.

They now debated what course to take, in order to avoid the pursuit of
Mr Western, who they knew would send after them in a few hours. The
London road had such charms for Honour, that she was desirous of going
on directly; alleging that, as Sophia could not be missed till eight
or nine the next morning, her pursuers would not be able to overtake
her, even though they knew which way she had gone. But Sophia had too
much at stake to venture anything to chance; nor did she dare trust
too much to her tender limbs, in a contest which was to be decided
only by swiftness. She resolved, therefore, to travel across the
country, for at least twenty or thirty miles, and then to take the
direct road to London. So, having hired horses to go twenty miles one
way, when she intended to go twenty miles the other, she set forward
with the same guide behind whom she had ridden from her father's
house; the guide having now taken up behind him, in the room of
Sophia, a much heavier, as well as much less lovely burden; being,
indeed, a huge portmanteau, well stuffed with those outside ornaments,
by means of which the fair Honour hoped to gain many conquests, and,
finally, to make her fortune in London city.

When they had gone about two hundred paces from the inn on the London
road, Sophia rode up to the guide, and, with a voice much fuller of
honey than was ever that of Plato, though his mouth is supposed to
have been a bee-hive, begged him to take the first turning which led
towards Bristol.

Reader, I am not superstitious, nor any great believer of modern
miracles. I do not, therefore, deliver the following as a certain
truth; for, indeed, I can scarce credit it myself: but the fidelity of
an historian obliges me to relate what hath been confidently asserted.
The horse, then, on which the guide rode, is reported to have been so
charmed by Sophia's voice, that he made a full stop, and expressed an
unwillingness to proceed any farther.

Perhaps, however, the fact may be true, and less miraculous than it
hath been represented; since the natural cause seems adequate to the
effect: for, as the guide at that moment desisted from a constant
application of his armed right heel (for, like Hudibras, he wore but
one spur), it is more than possible that this omission alone might
occasion the beast to stop, especially as this was very frequent with
him at other times.

But if the voice of Sophia had really an effect on the horse, it had
very little on the rider. He answered somewhat surlily, "That measter
had ordered him to go a different way, and that he should lose his
place if he went any other than that he was ordered."

Sophia, finding all her persuasions had no effect, began now to add
irresistible charms to her voice; charms which, according to the
proverb, makes the old mare trot, instead of standing still; charms!
to which modern ages have attributed all that irresistible force which
the antients imputed to perfect oratory. In a word, she promised she
would reward him to his utmost expectation.

The lad was not totally deaf to these promises; but he disliked their
being indefinite; for, though perhaps he had never heard that word,
yet that, in fact, was his objection. He said, "Gentlevolks did not
consider the case of poor volks; that he had like to have been turned
away the other day, for riding about the country with a gentleman from
Squire Allworthy's, who did not reward him as he should have done."

"With whom?" says Sophia eagerly. "With a gentleman from Squire
Allworthy's," repeated the lad; "the squire's son, I think they call
'un."--"Whither? which way did he go?" says Sophia.--"Why, a little o'
one side o' Bristol, about twenty miles off," answered the
lad.--"Guide me," says Sophia, "to the same place, and I'll give thee
a guinea, or two, if one is not sufficient."--"To be certain," said
the boy, "it is honestly worth two, when your ladyship considers what
a risk I run; but, however, if your ladyship will promise me the two
guineas, I'll e'en venture: to be certain it is a sinful thing to ride
about my measter's horses; but one comfort is, I can only be turned
away, and two guineas will partly make me amends."

The bargain being thus struck, the lad turned aside into the Bristol
road, and Sophia set forward in pursuit of Jones, highly contrary to
the remonstrances of Mrs Honour, who had much more desire to see London
than to see Mr Jones: for indeed she was not his friend with her
mistress, as he had been guilty of some neglect in certain pecuniary
civilities, which are by custom due to the waiting-gentlewoman in all
love affairs, and more especially in those of a clandestine kind. This
we impute rather to the carelessness of his temper than to any want of
generosity; but perhaps she derived it from the latter motive. Certain
it is that she hated him very bitterly on that account, and resolved to
take every opportunity of injuring him with her mistress. It was
therefore highly unlucky for her, that she had gone to the very same
town and inn whence Jones had started, and still more unlucky was she
in having stumbled on the same guide, and on this accidental discovery
which Sophia had made.

Our travellers arrived at Hambrook[*] at the break of day, where
Honour was against her will charged to enquire the route which Mr
Jones had taken. Of this, indeed, the guide himself could have
informed them; but Sophia, I know not for what reason, never asked him
the question.

 [*] This was the village where Jones met the Quaker.

When Mrs Honour had made her report from the landlord, Sophia, with
much difficulty, procured some indifferent horses, which brought her
to the inn where Jones had been confined rather by the misfortune of
meeting with a surgeon than by having met with a broken head.

Here Honour, being again charged with a commission of enquiry, had no
sooner applied herself to the landlady, and had described the person
of Mr Jones, than that sagacious woman began, in the vulgar phrase, to
smell a rat. When Sophia therefore entered the room, instead of
answering the maid, the landlady, addressing herself to the mistress,
began the following speech: "Good lack-a-day! why there now, who would
have thought it? I protest the loveliest couple that ever eye beheld.
I-fackins, madam, it is no wonder the squire run on so about your
ladyship. He told me indeed you was the finest lady in the world, and
to be sure so you be. Mercy on him, poor heart! I bepitied him, so I
did, when he used to hug his pillow, and call it his dear Madam
Sophia. I did all I could to dissuade him from going to the wars: I
told him there were men enow that were good for nothing else but to be
killed, that had not the love of such fine ladies." "Sure," says
Sophia, "the good woman is distracted." "No, no," cries the landlady,
"I am not distracted. What, doth your ladyship think I don't know
then? I assure you he told me all." "What saucy fellow," cries Honour,
"told you anything of my lady?" "No saucy fellow," answered the
landlady, "but the young gentleman you enquired after, and a very
pretty young gentleman he is, and he loves Madam Sophia Western to the
bottom of his soul." "He love my lady! I'd have you to know, woman,
she is meat for his master."--"Nay, Honour," said Sophia, interrupting
her, "don't be angry with the good woman; she intends no harm." "No,
marry, don't I," answered the landlady, emboldened by the soft accents
of Sophia; and then launched into a long narrative too tedious to be
here set down, in which some passages dropt that gave a little offence
to Sophia, and much more to her waiting-woman, who hence took occasion
to abuse poor Jones to her mistress the moment they were alone
together, saying, "that he must be a very pitiful fellow, and could
have no love for a lady, whose name he would thus prostitute in an
ale-house."

Sophia did not see his behaviour in so very disadvantageous a light,
and was perhaps more pleased with the violent raptures of his love
(which the landlady exaggerated as much as she had done every other
circumstance) than she was offended with the rest; and indeed she
imputed the whole to the extravagance, or rather ebullience, of his
passion, and to the openness of his heart.

This incident, however, being afterwards revived in her mind, and
placed in the most odious colours by Honour, served to heighten and
give credit to those unlucky occurrences at Upton, and assisted the
waiting-woman in her endeavours to make her mistress depart from that
inn without seeing Jones.

The landlady finding Sophia intended to stay no longer than till her
horses were ready, and that without either eating or drinking, soon
withdrew; when Honour began to take her mistress to task (for indeed
she used great freedom), and after a long harangue, in which she
reminded her of her intention to go to London, and gave frequent hints
of the impropriety of pursuing a young fellow, she at last concluded
with this serious exhortation: "For heaven's sake, madam, consider
what you are about, and whither you are going."

This advice to a lady who had already rode near forty miles, and in no
very agreeable season, may seem foolish enough. It may be supposed she
had well considered and resolved this already; nay, Mrs Honour, by the
hints she threw out, seemed to think so; and this I doubt not is the
opinion of many readers, who have, I make no doubt, been long since
well convinced of the purpose of our heroine, and have heartily
condemned her for it as a wanton baggage.

But in reality this was not the case. Sophia had been lately so
distracted between hope and fear, her duty and love to her father, her
hatred to Blifil, her compassion, and (why should we not confess the
truth?) her love for Jones; which last the behaviour of her father, of
her aunt, of every one else, and more particularly of Jones himself,
had blown into a flame, that her mind was in that confused state which
may be truly said to make us ignorant of what we do, or whither we go,
or rather, indeed, indifferent as to the consequence of either.

The prudent and sage advice of her maid produced, however, some cool
reflection; and she at length determined to go to Gloucester, and
thence to proceed directly to London.

But, unluckily, a few miles before she entered that town, she met the
hack-attorney, who, as is before mentioned, had dined there with Mr
Jones. This fellow, being well known to Mrs Honour, stopt and spoke to
her; of which Sophia at that time took little notice, more than to
enquire who he was.

But, having had a more particular account from Honour of this man
afterwards at Gloucester, and hearing of the great expedition he
usually made in travelling, for which (as hath been before observed)
he was particularly famous; recollecting, likewise, that she had
overheard Mrs Honour inform him that they were going to Gloucester,
she began to fear lest her father might, by this fellow's means, be
able to trace her to that city; wherefore, if she should there strike
into the London road, she apprehended he would certainly be able to
overtake her. She therefore altered her resolution; and, having hired
horses to go a week's journey a way which she did not intend to
travel, she again set forward after a light refreshment, contrary to
the desire and earnest entreaties of her maid, and to the no less
vehement remonstrances of Mrs Whitefield, who, from good breeding, or
perhaps from good nature (for the poor young lady appeared much
fatigued), pressed her very heartily to stay that evening at
Gloucester.

Having refreshed herself only with some tea, and with lying about two
hours on the bed, while her horses were getting ready, she resolutely
left Mrs Whitefield's about eleven at night, and, striking directly
into the Worcester road, within less than four hours arrived at that
very inn where we last saw her.

Having thus traced our heroine very particularly back from her
departure, till her arrival at Upton, we shall in a very few words
bring her father to the same place; who, having received the first
scent from the post-boy, who conducted his daughter to Hambrook, very
easily traced her afterwards to Gloucester; whence he pursued her to
Upton, as he had learned Mr Jones had taken that route (for Partridge,
to use the squire's expression, left everywhere a strong scent behind
him), and he doubted not in the least but Sophia travelled, or, as he
phrased it, ran, the same way. He used indeed a very coarse
expression, which need not be here inserted; as fox-hunters, who alone
will understand it, will easily suggest it to themselves.




BOOK XI.

CONTAINING ABOUT THREE DAYS.



Chapter i.

A crust for the critics.


In our last initial chapter we may be supposed to have treated that
formidable set of men who are called critics with more freedom than
becomes us; since they exact, and indeed generally receive, great
condescension from authors. We shall in this, therefore, give the
reasons of our conduct to this august body; and here we shall,
perhaps, place them in a light in which they have not hitherto been
seen.

This word critic is of Greek derivation, and signifies judgment. Hence
I presume some persons who have not understood the original, and have
seen the English translation of the primitive, have concluded that it
meant judgment in the legal sense, in which it is frequently used as
equivalent to condemnation.

I am the rather inclined to be of that opinion, as the greatest number
of critics hath of late years been found amongst the lawyers. Many of
these gentlemen, from despair, perhaps, of ever rising to the bench in
Westminster-hall, have placed themselves on the benches at the
playhouse, where they have exerted their judicial capacity, and have
given judgment, _i.e._, condemned without mercy.

The gentlemen would, perhaps, be well enough pleased, if we were to
leave them thus compared to one of the most important and honourable
offices in the commonwealth, and, if we intended to apply to their
favour, we would do so; but, as we design to deal very sincerely and
plainly too with them, we must remind them of another officer of
justice of a much lower rank; to whom, as they not only pronounce, but
execute, their own judgment, they bear likewise some remote
resemblance.

But in reality there is another light, in which these modern critics
may, with great justice and propriety, be seen; and this is that of a
common slanderer. If a person who prys into the characters of others,
with no other design but to discover their faults, and to publish them
to the world, deserves the title of a slanderer of the reputations of
men, why should not a critic, who reads with the same malevolent view,
be as properly stiled the slanderer of the reputation of books?

Vice hath not, I believe, a more abject slave; society produces not a
more odious vermin; nor can the devil receive a guest more worthy of
him, nor possibly more welcome to him, than a slanderer. The world, I
am afraid, regards not this monster with half the abhorrence which he
deserves; and I am more afraid to assign the reason of this criminal
lenity shown towards him; yet it is certain that the thief looks
innocent in the comparison; nay, the murderer himself can seldom stand
in competition with his guilt: for slander is a more cruel weapon than
a sword, as the wounds which the former gives are always incurable.
One method, indeed, there is of killing, and that the basest and most
execrable of all, which bears an exact analogy to the vice here
disclaimed against, and that is poison: a means of revenge so base,
and yet so horrible, that it was once wisely distinguished by our laws
from all other murders, in the peculiar severity of the punishment.

Besides the dreadful mischiefs done by slander, and the baseness of
the means by which they are effected, there are other circumstances
that highly aggravate its atrocious quality; for it often proceeds
from no provocation, and seldom promises itself any reward, unless
some black and infernal mind may propose a reward in the thoughts of
having procured the ruin and misery of another.

Shakespear hath nobly touched this vice, when he says--

 "Who steals my purse steals trash; 't is something, nothing;
  'Twas mine, 'tis his, and hath been slave to thousands:
  But he that filches from me my good name
  Robs me of that WHICH NOT ENRICHES HIM,
  BUT MAKES ME POOR INDEED."

With all this my good reader will doubtless agree; but much of it will
probably seem too severe, when applied to the slanderer of books. But
let it here be considered that both proceed from the same wicked
disposition of mind, and are alike void of the excuse of temptation.
Nor shall we conclude the injury done this way to be very slight, when
we consider a book as the author's offspring, and indeed as the child
of his brain.

The reader who hath suffered his muse to continue hitherto in a virgin
state can have but a very inadequate idea of this kind of paternal
fondness. To such we may parody the tender exclamation of Macduff,
"Alas! Thou hast written no book." But the author whose muse hath
brought forth will feel the pathetic strain, perhaps will accompany me
with tears (especially if his darling be already no more), while I
mention the uneasiness with which the big muse bears about her burden,
the painful labour with which she produces it, and, lastly, the care,
the fondness, with which the tender father nourishes his favourite,
till it be brought to maturity, and produced into the world.

Nor is there any paternal fondness which seems less to savour of
absolute instinct, and which may so well be reconciled to worldly
wisdom, as this. These children may most truly be called the riches of
their father; and many of them have with true filial piety fed their
parent in his old age: so that not only the affection, but the
interest, of the author may be highly injured by these slanderers,
whose poisonous breath brings his book to an untimely end.

Lastly, the slander of a book is, in truth, the slander of the author:
for, as no one can call another bastard, without calling the mother a
whore, so neither can any one give the names of sad stuff, horrid
nonsense, &c., to a book, without calling the author a blockhead;
which, though in a moral sense it is a preferable appellation to that
of villain, is perhaps rather more injurious to his worldly interest.

Now, however ludicrous all this may appear to some, others, I doubt
not, will feel and acknowledge the truth of it; nay, may, perhaps,
think I have not treated the subject with decent solemnity; but surely
a man may speak truth with a smiling countenance. In reality, to
depreciate a book maliciously, or even wantonly, is at least a very
ill-natured office; and a morose snarling critic may, I believe, be
suspected to be a bad man.

I will therefore endeavour, in the remaining part of this chapter, to
explain the marks of this character, and to show what criticism I here
intend to obviate: for I can never be understood, unless by the very
persons here meant, to insinuate that there are no proper judges of
writing, or to endeavour to exclude from the commonwealth of
literature any of those noble critics to whose labours the learned
world are so greatly indebted. Such were Aristotle, Horace, and
Longinus, among the antients, Dacier and Bossu among the French, and
some perhaps among us; who have certainly been duly authorised to
execute at least a judicial authority _in foro literario_.

But without ascertaining all the proper qualifications of a critic,
which I have touched on elsewhere, I think I may very boldly object to
the censures of any one past upon works which he hath not himself
read. Such censurers as these, whether they speak from their own guess
or suspicion, or from the report and opinion of others, may properly
be said to slander the reputation of the book they condemn.

Such may likewise be suspected of deserving this character, who,
without assigning any particular faults, condemn the whole in general
defamatory terms; such as vile, dull, d--d stuff, &c., and
particularly by the use of the monosyllable low; a word which becomes
the mouth of no critic who is not RIGHT HONOURABLE.

Again, though there may be some faults justly assigned in the work,
yet, if those are not in the most essential parts, or if they are
compensated by greater beauties, it will savour rather of the malice
of a slanderer than of the judgment of a true critic to pass a severe
sentence upon the whole, merely on account of some vicious part. This
is directly contrary to the sentiments of Horace:

     _Verum ubi plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis
     Offendor maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,
     Aut humana parum cavit natura----_

     But where the beauties, more in number, shine,
     I am not angry, when a casual line
     (That with some trivial faults unequal flows)
     A careless hand or human frailty shows.--MR FRANCIS.

For, as Martial says, _Aliter non fit, Avite, liber_. No book can be
otherwise composed. All beauty of character, as well as of
countenance, and indeed of everything human, is to be tried in this
manner. Cruel indeed would it be if such a work as this history, which
hath employed some thousands of hours in the composing, should be
liable to be condemned, because some particular chapter, or perhaps
chapters, may be obnoxious to very just and sensible objections. And
yet nothing is more common than the most rigorous sentence upon books
supported by such objections, which, if they were rightly taken (and
that they are not always), do by no means go to the merit of the
whole. In the theatre especially, a single expression which doth not
coincide with the taste of the audience, or with any individual critic
of that audience, is sure to be hissed; and one scene which should be
disapproved would hazard the whole piece. To write within such severe
rules as these is as impossible as to live up to some splenetic
opinions: and if we judge according to the sentiments of some critics,
and of some Christians, no author will be saved in this world, and no
man in the next.



Chapter ii.

The adventures which Sophia met with after her leaving Upton.


Our history, just before it was obliged to turn about and travel
backwards, had mentioned the departure of Sophia and her maid from the
inn; we shall now therefore pursue the steps of that lovely creature,
and leave her unworthy lover a little longer to bemoan his ill-luck,
or rather his ill-conduct.

Sophia having di of disturbing her
ladyship, but upon business of the utmost consequence." She then
opened the whole affair, told all she had heard from Betty; and did
not forget the visit which Jones had paid to herself the preceding
evening.

Lady Bellaston answered with a smile, "Then you have seen this
terrible man, madam; pray, is he so very fine a figure as he is
represented? for Etoff entertained me last night almost two hours with
him. The wench I believe is in love with him by reputation." Here the
reader will be apt to wonder; but the truth is, that Mrs Etoff, who
had the honour to pin and unpin the Lady Bellaston, had received
compleat information concerning the said Mr Jones, and had faithfully
conveyed the same to her lady last night (or rather that morning)
while she was undressing; on which accounts she had been detained in
her office above the space of an hour and a half.

The lady indeed, though generally well enough pleased with the
narratives of Mrs Etoff at those seasons, gave an extraordinary
attention to her account of Jones; for Honour had described him as a
very handsome fellow, and Mrs Etoff, in her hurry, added so much to
the beauty of his person to her report, that Lady Bellaston began to
conceive him to be a kind of miracle in nature.

The curiosity which her woman had inspired was now greatly increased
by Mrs Fitzpatrick, who spoke as much in favour of the person of Jones
as she had before spoken in dispraise of his birth, character, and
fortune.

When Lady Bellaston had heard the whole, she answered gravely,
"Indeed, madam, this is a matter of great consequence. Nothing can
certainly be more commendable than the part you act; and I shall be
very glad to have my share in the preservation of a young lady of so
much merit, and for whom I have so much esteem."

"Doth not your ladyship think," says Mrs Fitzpatrick eagerly, "that it
would be the best way to write immediately to my uncle, and acquaint
him where my cousin is?"

The lady pondered a little upon this, and thus answered--"Why, no,
madam, I think not. Di Western hath described her brother to me to be
such a brute, that I cannot consent to put any woman under his power
who hath escaped from it. I have heard he behaved like a monster to
his own wife, for he is one of those wretches who think they have a
right to tyrannise over us, and from such I shall ever esteem it the
cause of my sex to rescue any woman who is so unfortunate to be under
their power.--The business, dear cousin, will be only to keep Miss
Western from seeing this young fellow, till the good company, which
she will have an opportunity of meeting here, give her a properer
turn."

"If he should find her out, madam," answered the other, "your ladyship
may be assured he will leave nothing unattempted to come at her."

"But, madam," replied the lady, "it is impossible he should come
here--though indeed it is possible he may get some intelligence where
she is, and then may lurk about the house--I wish therefore I knew his
person.

"Is there no way, madam, by which I could have a sight of him? for,
otherwise, you know, cousin, she may contrive to see him here without
my knowledge." Mrs Fitzpatrick answered, "That he had threatened her
with another visit that afternoon, and that, if her ladyship pleased
to do her the honour of calling upon her then, she would hardly fail
of seeing him between six and seven; and if he came earlier she would,
by some means or other, detain him till her ladyship's arrival."--Lady
Bellaston replied, "She would come the moment she could get from
dinner, which she supposed would be by seven at farthest; for that it
was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his person.
Upon my word, madam," says she, "it was very good to take this care of
Miss Western; but common humanity, as well as regard to our family,
requires it of us both; for it would be a dreadful match indeed."

Mrs Fitzpatrick failed not to make a proper return to the compliment
which Lady Bellaston had bestowed on her cousin, and, after some
little immaterial conversation, withdrew; and, getting as fast as she
could into her chair, unseen by Sophia or Honour, returned home.



Chapter iv.

Which consists of visiting.


Mr Jones had walked within sight of a certain door during the whole
day, which, though one of the shortest, appeared to him to be one of
the longest in the whole year. At length, the clock having struck
five, he returned to Mrs Fitzpatrick, who, though it was a full hour
earlier than the decent time of visiting, received him very civilly;
but still persisted in her ignorance concerning Sophia.

Jones, in asking for his angel, had dropped the word cousin, upon
which Mrs Fitzpatrick said, "Then, sir, you know we are related: and,
as we are, you will permit me the right of enquiring into the
particulars of your business with my cousin." Here Jones hesitated a
good while, and at last answered, "He had a considerable sum of money
of hers in his hands, which he desired to deliver to her." He then
produced the pocket-book, and acquainted Mrs Fitzpatrick with the
contents, and with the method in which they came into his hands. He
had scarce finished his story, when a most violent noise shook the
whole house. To attempt to describe this noise to those who have heard
it would be in vain; and to aim at giving any idea of it to those who
have never heard the like, would be still more vain: for it may be
truly said--

                     _--Non acuta
     Sic geminant Corybantes aera._

     The priests of Cybele do not so rattle their sounding brass.

In short, a footman knocked, or rather thundered, at the door. Jones
was a little surprized at the sound, having never heard it before; but
Mrs Fitzpatrick very calmly said, that, as some company were coming,
she could not make him any answer now; but if he pleased to stay till
they were gone, she intimated she had something to say to him.

The door of the room now flew open, and, after pushing in her hoop
sideways before her, entered Lady Bellaston, who having first made a
very low courtesy to Mrs Fitzpatrick, and as low a one to Mr Jones,
was ushered to the upper end of the room.

We mention these minute matters for the sake of some country ladies of
our acquaintance, who think it contrary to the rules of modesty to
bend their knees to a man.

The company were hardly well settled, before the arrival of the peer
lately mentioned, caused a fresh disturbance, and a repetition of
ceremonials.

These being over, the conversation began to be (as the phrase is)
extremely brilliant. However, as nothing past in it which can be
thought material to this history, or, indeed, very material in itself,
I shall omit the relation; the rather, as I have known some very fine
polite conversation grow extremely dull, when transcribed into books,
or repeated on the stage. Indeed, this mental repast is a dainty, of
which those who are excluded from polite assemblies must be contented
to remain as ignorant as they must of the several dainties of French
cookery, which are served only at the tables of the great. To say the
truth, as neither of these are adapted to every taste, they might both
be often thrown away on the vulgar.

Poor Jones was rather a spectator of this elegant scene, than an actor
in it; for though, in the short interval before the peer's arrival,
Lady Bellaston first, and afterwards Mrs Fitzpatrick, had addressed
some of their discourse to him; yet no sooner was the noble lord
entered, than he engrossed the whole attention of the two ladies to
himself; and as he took no more notice of Jones than if no such person
had been present, unless by now and then staring at him, the ladies
followed his example.

The company had now staid so long, that Mrs Fitzpatrick plainly
perceived they all designed to stay out each other. She therefore
resolved to rid herself of Jones, he being the visitant to whom she
thought the least ceremony was due. Taking therefore an opportunity of
a cessation of chat, she addressed herself gravely to him, and said,
"Sir, I shall not possibly be able to give you an answer to-night as
to that business; but if you please to leave word where I may send to
you to-morrow---"

Jones had natural, but not artificial good-breeding. Instead therefore
of communicating the secret of his lodgings to a servant, he
acquainted the lady herself with it particularly, and soon after very
ceremoniously withdrew.

He was no sooner gone than the great personages, who had taken no
notice of him present, began to take much notice of him in his
absence; but if the reader hath already excused us from relating the
more brilliant part of this conversation, he will surely be very ready
to excuse the repetition of what may be called vulgar abuse; though,
perhaps, it may be material to our history to mention an observation
of Lady Bellaston, who took her leave in a few minutes after him, and
then said to Mrs Fitzpatrick, at her departure, "I am satisfied on the
account of my cousin; she can be in no danger from this fellow."

Our history shall follow the example of Lady Bellaston, and take leave
of the present company, which was now reduced to two persons; between
whom, as nothing passed, which in the least concerns us or our reader,
we shall not suffer ourselves to be diverted by it from matters which
must seem of more consequence to all those who are at all interested
in the affairs of our heroe.



Chapter v.

An adventure which happened to Mr Jones at his lodgings, with some
account of a young gentleman who lodged there, and of the mistress of
the house, and her two daughters.


The next morning, as early as it was decent, Jones attended at Mrs
Fitzpatrick's door, where he was answered that the lady was not at
home; an answer which surprized him the more, as he had walked
backwards and forwards in the street from break of day; and if she had
gone out, he must have seen her. This answer, however, he was obliged
to receive, and not only now, but to five several visits which he made
her that day.

To be plain with the reader, the noble peer had from some reason or
other, perhaps from a regard for the lady's honour, insisted that she
should not see Mr Jones, whom he looked on as a scrub, any more; and
the lady had complied in making that promise to which we now see her
so strictly adhere.

But as our gentle reader may possibly have a better opinion of the
young gentleman than her ladyship, and may even have some concern,
should it be apprehended that, during this unhappy separation from
Sophia, he took up his residence either at an inn, or in the street;
we shall now give an account of his lodging, which was indeed in a
very reputable house, and in a very good part of the town.

Mr Jones, then, had often heard Mr Allworthy mention the gentlewoman
at whose house he used to lodge when he was in town. This person, who,
as Jones likewise knew, lived in Bond-street, was the widow of a
clergyman, and was left by him, at his decease, in possession of two
daughters, and of a compleat set of manuscript sermons.

Of these two daughters, Nancy, the elder, was now arrived at the age
of seventeen, and Betty, the younger, at that of ten.

Hither Jones had despatched Partridge, and in this house he was
provided with a room for himself in the second floor, and with one for
Partridge in the fourth.

The first floor was inhabited by one of those young gentlemen, who, in
the last age, were called men of wit and pleasure about town, and
properly enough; for as men are usually denominated from their
business or profession, so pleasure may be said to have been the only
business or profession of those gentlemen to whom fortune had made all
useful occupations unnecessary. Playhouses, coffeehouses, and taverns
were the scenes of their rendezvous. Wit and humour were the
entertainment of their looser hours, and love was the business of
their more serious moments. Wine and the muses conspired to kindle the
brightest flames in their breasts; nor did they only admire, but some
were able to celebrate the beauty they admired, and all to judge of
the merit of such compositions.

Such, therefore, were properly called the men of wit and pleasure; but
I question whether the same appellation may, with the same propriety,
be given to those young gentlemen of our times, who have the same
ambition to be distinguished for parts. Wit certainly they have
nothing to do with. To give them their due, they soar a step higher
than their predecessors, and may be called men of wisdom and vertù
(take heed you do not read virtue). Thus at an age when the gentlemen
above mentioned employ their time in toasting the charms of a woman,
or in making sonnets in her praise; in giving their opinion of a play
at the theatre, or of a poem at Will's or Button's; these gentlemen
are considering the methods to bribe a corporation, or meditating
speeches for the House of Commons, or rather for the magazines. But
the science of gaming is that which above all others employs their
thoughts. These are the studies of their graver hours, while for their
amusements they have the vast circle of connoisseurship, painting,
music, statuary, and natural philosophy, or rather _unnatural_, which
deals in the wonderful, and knows nothing of Nature, except her
monsters and imperfections.

When Jones had spent the whole day in vain enquiries after Mrs
Fitzpatrick, he returned at last disconsolate to his apartment. Here,
while he was venting his grief in private, he heard a violent uproar
below-stairs; and soon after a female voice begged him for heaven's
sake to come and prevent murder. Jones, who was never backward on any
occasion to help the distressed, immediately ran down-stairs; when
stepping into the dining-room, whence all the noise issued, he beheld
the young gentleman of wisdom and vertù just before mentioned, pinned
close to the wall by his footman, and a young woman standing by,
wringing her hands, and crying out, "He will be murdered! he will be
murdered!" and, indeed, the poor gentleman seemed in some danger of
being choaked, when Jones flew hastily to his assistance, and rescued
him, just as he was breathing his last, from the unmerciful clutches
of the enemy.

Though the fellow had received several kicks and cuffs from the little
gentleman, who had more spirit than strength, he had made it a kind of
scruple of conscience to strike his master, and would have contented
himself with only choaking him; but towards Jones he bore no such
respect; he no sooner therefore found himself a little roughly handled
by his new antagonist, than he gave him one of those punches in the
guts which, though the spectators at Broughton's amphitheatre have
such exquisite delight in seeing them, convey but very little pleasure
in the feeling.

The lusty youth had no sooner received this blow, than he meditated a
most grateful return; and now ensued a combat between Jones and the
footman, which was very fierce, but short; for this fellow was no more
able to contend with Jones than his master had before been to contend
with him.

And now, Fortune, according to her usual custom, reversed the face of
affairs. The former victor lay breathless on the ground, and the
vanquished gentleman had recovered breath enough to thank Mr Jones for
his seasonable assistance; he received likewise the hearty thanks of
the young woman present, who was indeed no other than Miss Nancy, the
eldest daughter of the house.

The footman, having now recovered his legs, shook his head at Jones,
and, with a sagacious look, cried--"O d--n me, I'll have nothing more
to do with you; you have been upon the stage, or I'm d--nably
mistaken." And indeed we may forgive this his suspicion; for such was
the agility and strength of our heroe, that he was, perhaps, a match
for one of the first-rate boxers, and could, with great ease, have
beaten all the muffled[*] graduates of Mr Broughton's school.

  [*] Lest posterity should be puzzled by this epithet, I think proper
  to explain it by an advertisement which was published Feb. 1, 1747.

  N.B.--Mr Broughton proposes, with proper assistance, to open an
  academy at his house in the Haymarket, for the instruction of those
  who are willing to be initiated in the mystery of boxing: where the
  whole theory and practice of that truly British art, with all the
  various stops, blows, cross-buttocks, &c., incident to combatants,
  will be fully taught and explained; and that persons of quality and
  distinction may not be deterred from entering into _A course of
  those lectures_, they will be given with the utmost tenderness and
  regard to the delicacy of the frame and constitution of the pupil,
  for which reason muffles are provided, that will effectually secure
  them from the inconveniency of black eyes, broken jaws, and bloody
  noses.

The master, foaming with wrath, ordered his man immediately to strip,
to which the latter very readily agreed, on condition of receiving his
wages. This condition was presently complied with, and the fellow was
discharged.

And now the young gentleman, whose name was Nightingale, very
strenuously insisted that his deliverer should take part of a bottle
of wine with him; to which Jones, after much entreaty, consented,
though more out of complacence than inclination; for the uneasiness of
his mind fitted him very little for conversation at this time. Miss
Nancy likewise, who was the only female then in the house, her mamma
and sister being both gone to the play, condescended to favour them
with her company.

When the bottle and glasses were on the table the gentleman began to
relate the occasion of the preceding disturbance.

"I hope, sir," said he to Jones, "you will not from this accident
conclude, that I make a custom of striking my servants, for I assure
you this is the first time I have been guilty of it in my remembrance,
and I have passed by many provoking faults in this very fellow, before
he could provoke me to it; but when you hear what hath happened this
evening, you will, I believe, think me excusable. I happened to come
home several hours before my usual time, when I found four gentlemen
of the cloth at whist by my fire;--and my Hoyle, sir--my best Hoyle,
which cost me a guinea, lying open on the table, with a quantity of
porter spilt on one of the most material leaves of the whole book.
This, you will allow, was provoking; but I said nothing till the rest
of the honest company were gone, and then gave the fellow a gentle
rebuke, who, instead of expressing any concern, made me a pert answer,
`That servants must have their diversions as well as other people;
that he was sorry for the accident which had happened to the book, but
that several of his acquaintance had bought the same for a shilling,
and that I might stop as much in his wages, if I pleased.' I now gave
him a severer reprimand than before, when the rascal had the insolence
to---In short, he imputed my early coming home to----In short, he cast
a reflection----He mentioned the name of a young lady, in a manner--in
such a manner that incensed me beyond all patience, and, in my
passion, I struck him."

Jones answered, "That he believed no person living would blame him;
for my part," said he, "I confess I should, on the last-mentioned
provocation, have done the same thing."

Our company had not sat long before they were joined by the mother and
daughter, at their return from the play. And now they all spent a very
chearful evening together; for all but Jones were heartily merry, and
even he put on as much constrained mirth as possible. Indeed, half his
natural flow of animal spirits, joined to the sweetness of his temper,
was sufficient to make a most amiable companion; and notwithstanding
the heaviness of his heart, so agreeable did he make himself on the
present occasion, that, at their breaking up, the young gentleman
earnestly desired his further acquaintance. Miss Nancy was well
pleased with him; and the widow, quite charmed with her new lodger,
invited him, with the other, next morning to breakfast.

Jones on his part was no less satisfied. As for Miss Nancy, though a
very little creature, she was extremely pretty, and the widow had all
the charms which can adorn a woman near fifty. As she was one of the
most innocent creatures in the world, so she was one of the most
chearful. She never thought, nor spoke, nor wished any ill, and had
constantly that desire of pleasing, which may be called the happiest
of all desires in this, that it scarce ever fails of attaining its
ends, when not disgraced by affectation. In short, though her power
was very small, she was in her heart one of the warmest friends. She
had been a most affectionate wife, and was a most fond and tender
mother. As our history doth not, like a newspaper, give great
characters to people who never were heard of before, nor will ever be
heard of again, the reader may hence conclude, that this excellent
woman will hereafter appear to be of some importance in our history.

Nor was Jones a little pleased with the young gentleman himself, whose
wine he had been drinking. He thought he discerned in him much good
sense, though a little too much tainted with town-foppery; but what
recommended him most to Jones were some sentiments of great generosity
and humanity, which occasionally dropt from him; and particularly many
expressions of the highest disinterestedness in the affair of love. On
which subject the young gentleman delivered himself in a language
which might have very well become an Arcadian shepherd of old, and
which appeared very extraordinary when proceeding from the lips of a
modern fine gentleman; but he was only one by imitation, and meant by
nature for a much better character.



Chapter vi.

What arrived while the company were at breakfast, with some hints
concerning the government of daughters.


Our company brought together in the morning the same good inclinations
towards each other, with which they had separated the evening before;
but poor Jones was extremely disconsolate; for he had just received
information from Partridge, that Mrs Fitzpatrick had left her lodging,
and that he could not learn whither she was gone. This news highly
afflicted him, and his countenance, as well as his behaviour, in
defiance of all his endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest
indications of a disordered mind.

The discourse turned at present, as before, on love; and Mr
Nightingale again expressed many of those warm, generous, and
disinterested sentiments upon this subject, which wise and sober men
call romantic, but which wise and sober women generally regard in a
better light. Mrs Miller (for so the mistress of the house was called)
greatly approved these sentiments; but when the young gentleman
appealed to Miss Nancy, she answered only, "That she believed the
gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling most."

This compliment was so apparently directed to Jones, that we should
have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded. He made her indeed a
very polite answer, and concluded with an oblique hint, that her own
silence subjected her to a suspicion of the same kind: for indeed she
had scarce opened her lips either now or the last evening.

"I am glad, Nanny," says Mrs Miller, "the gentleman hath made the
observation; I protest I am almost of his opinion. What can be the
matter with you, child? I never saw such an alteration. What is become
of all your gaiety? Would you think, sir, I used to call her my little
prattler? She hath not spoke twenty words this week."

Here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a
maid-servant, who brought a bundle in her hand, which, she said, "was
delivered by a porter for Mr Jones." She added, "That the man
immediately went away, saying, it required no answer."

Jones expressed some surprize on this occasion, and declared it must
be some mistake; but the maid persisting that she was certain of the
name, all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately
opened; which operation was at length performed by little Betsy, with
the consent of Mr Jones: and the contents were found to be a domino, a
mask, and a masquerade ticket.

Jones was now more positive than ever in asserting, that these things
must have been delivered by mistake; and Mrs Miller herself expressed
some doubt, and said, "She knew not what to think." But when Mr
Nightingale was asked, he delivered a very different opinion. "All I
can conclude from it, sir," said he, "is, that you are a very happy
man; for I make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you
will have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade."

Jones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such
flattering imagination; nor did Mrs Miller herself give much assent to
what Mr Nightingale had said, till Miss Nancy having lifted up the
domino, a card dropt from the sleeve, in which was written as
follows:--

     To MR JONES.

     The queen of the fairies sends you this;
     Use her favours not amiss.

Mrs Miller and Miss Nancy now both agreed with Mr Nightingale; nay,
Jones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion. And as
no other lady but Mrs Fitzpatrick, he thought, knew his lodging, he
began to flatter himself with some hopes, that it came from her, and
that he might possibly see his Sophia. These hopes had surely very
little foundation; but as the conduct of Mrs Fitzpatrick, in not
seeing him according to her promise, and in quitting her lodgings, had
been very odd and unaccountable, he conceived some faint hopes, that
she (of whom he had formerly heard a very whimsical character) might
possibly intend to do him that service in a strange manner, which she
declined doing by more ordinary methods. To say the truth, as nothing
certain could be concluded from so odd and uncommon an incident, he
had the greater latitude to draw what imaginary conclusions from it he
pleased. As his temper therefore was naturally sanguine, he indulged
it on this occasion, and his imagination worked up a thousand
conceits, to favour and support his expectations of meeting his dear
Sophia in the evening.

Reader, if thou hast any good wishes towards me, I will fully repay
them by wishing thee to be possessed of this sanguine disposition of
mind; since, after having read much and considered long on that
subject of happiness which hath employed so many great pens, I am
almost inclined to fix it in the possession of this temper; which puts
us, in a manner, out of the reach of Fortune, and makes us happy
without her assistance. Indeed, the sensations of pleasure it gives
are much more constant as well as much keener, than those which that
blind lady bestows; nature having wisely contrived, that some satiety
and languor should be annexed to all our real enjoyments, lest we
should be so taken up by them, as to be stopt from further pursuits. I
make no manner of doubt but that, in this light, we may see the
imaginary future chancellor just called to the bar, the archbishop in
crape, and the prime minister at the tail of an opposition, more truly
happy than those who are invested with all the power and profit of
those respective offices.

Mr Jones having now determined to go to the masquerade that evening,
Mr Nightingale offered to conduct him thither. The young gentleman, at
the same time, offered tickets to Miss Nancy and her mother; but the
good woman would not accept them. She said, "she did not conceive the
harm which some people imagined in a masquerade; but that such
extravagant diversions were proper only for persons of quality and
fortune, and not for young women who were to get their living, and
could, at best, hope to be married to a good tradesman."----"A
tradesman!" cries Nightingale, "you shan't undervalue my Nancy. There
is not a nobleman upon earth above her merit." "O fie! Mr
Nightingale," answered Mrs Miller, "you must not fill the girl's head
with such fancies: but if it was her good luck" (says the mother with
a simper) "to find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking, I
hope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her
mind up to extravagant pleasures. Indeed, where young ladies bring
great fortunes themselves, they have some right to insist on spending
what is their own; and on that account I have heard the gentlemen say,
a man has sometimes a better bargain with a poor wife, than with a
rich one.----But let my daughters marry whom they will, I shall
endeavour to make them blessings to their husbands:----I beg,
therefore, I may hear of no more masquerades. Nancy is, I am certain,
too good a girl to desire to go; for she must remember when you
carried her thither last year, it almost turned her head; and she did
not return to herself, or to her needle, in a month afterwards."

Though a gentle sigh, which stole from the bosom of Nancy, seemed to
argue some secret disapprobation of these sentiments, she did not dare
openly to oppose them. For as this good woman had all the tenderness,
so she had preserved all the authority of a parent; and as her
indulgence to the desires of her children was restrained only by her
fears for their safety and future welfare, so she never suffered those
commands which proceeded from such fears to be either disobeyed or
disputed. And this the young gentleman, who had lodged two years in
the house, knew so well, that he presently acquiesced in the refusal.

Mr Nightingale, who grew every minute fonder of Jones, was very
desirous of his company that day to dinner at the tavern, where he
offered to introduce him to some of his acquaintance; but Jones begged
to be excused, "as his cloaths," he said, "were not yet come to town."

To confess the truth, Mr Jones was now in a situation, which sometimes
happens to be the case of young gentlemen of much better figure than
himself. In short, he had not one penny in his pocket; a situation in
much greater credit among the antient philosophers than among the
modern wise men who live in Lombard-street, or those who frequent
White's chocolate-house. And, perhaps, the great honours which those
philosophers have ascribed to an empty pocket may be one of the
reasons of that high contempt in which they are held in the aforesaid
street and chocolate-house.

Now if the antient opinion, that men might live very comfortably on
virtue only, be, as the modern wise men just above-mentioned pretend
to have discovered, a notorious error; no less false is, I apprehend,
that position of some writers of romance, that a man can live
altogether on love; for however delicious repasts this may afford to
some of our senses or appetites, it is most certain it can afford none
to others. Those, therefore, who have placed too great a confidence in
such writers, have experienced their error when it was too late; and
have found that love was no more capable of allaying hunger, than a
rose is capable of delighting the ear, or a violin of gratifying the
smell.

Notwithstanding, therefore, all the delicacies which love had set
before him, namely, the hopes of seeing Sophia at the masquerade; on
which, however ill-founded his imagination might be, he had
voluptuously feasted during the whole day, the evening no sooner came
than Mr Jones began to languish for some food of a grosser kind.
Partridge discovered this by intuition, and took the occasion to give
some oblique hints concerning the bank-bill; and, when these were
rejected with disdain, he collected courage enough once more to
mention a return to Mr Allworthy.

"Partridge," cries Jones, "you cannot see my fortune in a more
desperate light than I see it myself; and I begin heartily to repent
that I suffered you to leave a place where you was settled, and to
follow me. However, I insist now on your returning home; and for the
expense and trouble which you have so kindly put yourself to on my
account, all the cloaths I left behind in your care I desire you would
take as your own. I am sorry I can make you no other acknowledgment."

He spoke these words with so pathetic an accent, that Partridge, among
whose vices ill-nature or hardness of heart were not numbered, burst
into tears; and after swearing he would not quit him in his distress,
he began with the most earnest entreaties to urge his return home.
"For heaven's sake, sir," says he, "do but consider; what can your
honour do?--how is it possible you can live in this town without
money? Do what you will, sir, or go wherever you please, I am resolved
not to desert you. But pray, sir, consider--do pray, sir, for your own
sake, take it into your consideration; and I'm sure," says he, "that
your own good sense will bid you return home."

"How often shall I tell thee," answered Jones, "that I have no home to
return to? Had I any hopes that Mr Allworthy's doors would be open to
receive me, I want no distress to urge me--nay, there is no other
cause upon earth, which could detain me a moment from flying to his
presence; but, alas! that I am for ever banished from. His last words
were--O, Partridge, they still ring in my ears--his last words were,
when he gave me a sum of money--what it was I know not, but
considerable I'm sure it was--his last words were--`I am resolved from
this day forward, on no account to converse with you any more.'"

Here passion stopt the mouth of Jones, as surprize for a moment did
that of Partridge; but he soon recovered the use of speech, and after
a short preface, in which he declared he had no inquisitiveness in his
temper, enquired what Jones meant by a considerable sum--he knew not
how much--and what was become of the money.

In both these points he now received full satisfaction; on which he
was proceeding to comment, when he was interrupted by a message from
Mr Nightingale, who desired his master's company in his apartment.

When the two gentlemen were both attired for the masquerade, and Mr
Nightingale had given orders for chairs to be sent for, a circumstance
of distress occurred to Jones, which will appear very ridiculous to
many of my readers. This was how to procure a shilling; but if such
readers will reflect a little on what they have themselves felt from
the want of a thousand pounds, or, perhaps, of ten or twenty, to
execute a favourite scheme, they will have a perfect idea of what Mr
Jones felt on this occasion. For this sum, therefore, he applied to
Partridge, which was the first he had permitted him to advance, and
was the last he intended that poor fellow should advance in his
service. To say the truth, Partridge had lately made no offer of this
kind. Whether it was that he desired to see the bank-bill broke in
upon, or that distress should prevail on Jones to return home, or from
what other motive it proceeded, I will not determine.



Chapter vii.

Containing the whole humours of a masquerade.


Our cavaliers now arrived at that temple, where Heydegger, the great
Arbiter Deliciarum, the great high-priest of pleasure, presides; and,
like other heathen priests, imposes on his votaries by the pretended
presence of the deity, when in reality no such deity is there.

Mr Nightingale, having taken a turn or two with his companion, soon
left him, and walked off with a female, saying, "Now you are here,
sir, you must beat about for your own game."

Jones began to entertain strong hopes that his Sophia was present; and
these hopes gave him more spirits than the lights, the music, and the
company; though these are pretty strong antidotes against the spleen.
He now accosted every woman he saw, whose stature, shape, or air, bore
any resemblance to his angel. To all of whom he endeavoured to say
something smart, in order to engage an answer, by which he might
discover that voice which he thought it impossible he should mistake.
Some of these answered by a question, in a squeaking voice, Do you
know me? Much the greater number said, I don't know you, sir, and
nothing more. Some called him an impertinent fellow; some made him no
answer at all; some said, Indeed I don't know your voice, and I shall
have nothing to say to you; and many gave him as kind answers as he
could wish, but not in the voice he desired to hear.

Whilst he was talking with one of these last (who was in the habit of
a shepherdess) a lady in a domino came up to him, and slapping him on
the shoulder, whispered him, at the same time, in the ear, "If you
talk any longer with that trollop, I will acquaint Miss Western."

Jones no sooner heard that name, than, immediately quitting his former
companion, he applied to the domino, begging and entreating her to
show him the lady she had mentioned, if she was then in the room.

The mask walked hastily to the upper end of the innermost apartment
before she spoke; and then, instead of answering him, sat down, and
declared she was tired. Jones sat down by her, and still persisted in
his entreaties; at last the lady coldly answered, "I imagined Mr Jones
had been a more discerning lover, than to suffer any disguise to
conceal his mistress from him." "Is she here, then, madam?" replied
Jones, with some vehemence. Upon which the lady cried--"Hush, sir, you
will be observed. I promise you, upon my honour, Miss Western is not
here."

Jones, now taking the mask by the hand, fell to entreating her in the
most earnest manner, to acquaint him where he might find Sophia; and
when he could obtain no direct answer, he began to upbraid her gently
for having disappointed him the day before; and concluded, saying,
"Indeed, my good fairy queen, I know your majesty very well,
notwithstanding the affected disguise of your voice. Indeed, Mrs
Fitzpatrick, it is a little cruel to divert yourself at the expense of
my torments."

The mask answered, "Though you have so ingeniously discovered me, I
must still speak in the same voice, lest I should be known by others.
And do you think, good sir, that I have no greater regard for my
cousin, than to assist in carrying on an affair between you two, which
must end in her ruin, as well as your own? Besides, I promise you, my
cousin is not mad enough to consent to her own destruction, if you are
so much her enemy as to tempt her to it."

"Alas, madam!" said Jones, "you little know my heart, when you call me
an enemy of Sophia."

"And yet to ruin any one," cries the other, "you will allow, is the
act of an enemy; and when by the same act you must knowingly and
certainly bring ruin on yourself, is it not folly or madness, as well
as guilt? Now, sir, my cousin hath very little more than her father
will please to give her; very little for one of her fashion--you know
him, and you know your own situation."

Jones vowed he had no such design on Sophia, "That he would rather
suffer the most violent of deaths than sacrifice her interest to his
desires." He said, "he knew how unworthy he was of her, every way,
that he had long ago resolved to quit all such aspiring thoughts, but
that some strange accidents had made him desirous to see her once
more, when he promised he would take leave of her for ever. No,
madam," concluded he, "my love is not of that base kind which seeks
its own satisfaction at the expense of what is most dear to its
object. I would sacrifice everything to the possession of my Sophia,
but Sophia herself."

Though the reader may have already conceived no very sublime idea of
the virtue of the lady in the mask; and though possibly she may
hereafter appear not to deserve one of the first characters of her
sex; yet, it is certain, these generous sentiments made a strong
impression upon her, and greatly added to the affection she had before
conceived for our young heroe.

The lady now, after silence of a few moments, said, "She did not see
his pretensions to Sophia so much in the light of presumption, as of
imprudence. Young fellows," says she, "can never have too aspiring
thoughts. I love ambition in a young man, and I would have you
cultivate it as much as possible. Perhaps you may succeed with those
who are infinitely superior in fortune; nay, I am convinced there are
women----but don't you think me a strange creature, Mr Jones, to be
thus giving advice to a man with whom I am so little acquainted, and
one with whose behaviour to me I have so little reason to be pleased?"

Here Jones began to apologize, and to hope he had not offended in
anything he had said of her cousin.--To which the mask answered, "And
are you so little versed in the sex, to imagine you can well affront a
lady more than by entertaining her with your passion for another
woman? If the fairy queen had conceived no better opinion of your
gallantry, she would scarce have appointed you to meet her at the
masquerade."

Jones had never less inclination to an amour than at present; but
gallantry to the ladies was among his principles of honour; and he
held it as much incumbent on him to accept a challenge to love, as if
it had been a challenge to fight. Nay, his very love to Sophia made it
necessary for him to keep well with the lady, as he made no doubt but
she was capable of bringing him into the presence of the other.

He began therefore to make a very warm answer to her last speech, when
a mask, in the character of an old woman, joined them. This mask was
one of those ladies who go to a masquerade only to vent ill-nature, by
telling people rude truths, and by endeavouring, as the phrase is, to
spoil as much sport as they are able. This good lady, therefore,
having observed Jones, and his friend, whom she well knew, in close
consultation together in a corner of the room, concluded she could
nowhere satisfy her spleen better than by interrupting them. She
attacked them, therefore, and soon drove them from their retirement;
nor was she contented with this, but pursued them to every place which
they shifted to avoid her; till Mr Nightingale, seeing the distress of
his friend, at last relieved him, and engaged the old woman in another
pursuit.

While Jones and his mask were walking together about the room, to rid
themselves of the teazer, he observed his lady speak to several masks,
with the same freedom of acquaintance as if they had been barefaced.
He could not help expressing his surprize at this; saying, "Sure,
madam, you must have infinite discernment, to know people in all
disguises." To which the lady answered, "You cannot conceive anything
more insipid and childish than a masquerade to the people of fashion,
who in general know one another as well here as when they meet in an
assembly or a drawing-room; nor will any woman of condition converse
with a person with whom she is not acquainted. In short, the
generality of persons whom you see here may more properly be said to
kill time in this place than in any other; and generally retire from
hence more tired than from the longest sermon. To say the truth, I
begin to be in that situation myself; and if I have any faculty at
guessing, you are not much better pleased. I protest it would be
almost charity in me to go home for your sake." "I know but one
charity equal to it," cries Jones, "and that is to suffer me to wait
on you home." "Sure," answered the lady, "you have a strange opinion
of me, to imagine, that upon such an acquaintance, I would let you
into my doors at this time of night. I fancy you impute the friendship
I have shown my cousin to some other motive. Confess honestly; don't
you consider this contrived interview as little better than a
downright assignation? Are you used, Mr Jones, to make these sudden
conquests?" "I am not used, madam," said Jones, "to submit to such
sudden conquests; but as you have taken my heart by surprize, the rest
of my body hath a right to follow; so you must pardon me if I resolve
to attend you wherever you go." He accompanied these words with some
proper actions; upon which the lady, after a gentle rebuke, and saying
their familiarity would be observed, told him, "She was going to sup
with an acquaintance, whither she hoped he would not follow her; for
if you should," said she, "I shall be thought an unaccountable
creature, though my friend indeed is not censorious: yet I hope you
won't follow me; I protest I shall not know what to say if you do."

The lady presently after quitted the masquerade, and Jones,
notwithstanding the severe prohibition he had received, presumed to
attend her. He was now reduced to the same dilemma we have mentioned
before, namely, the want of a shilling, and could not relieve it by
borrowing as before. He therefore walked boldly on after the chair in
which his lady rode, pursued by a grand huzza, from all the chairmen
present, who wisely take the best care they can to discountenance all
walking afoot by their betters. Luckily, however, the gentry who
attend at the Opera-house were too busy to quit their stations, and as
the lateness of the hour prevented him from meeting many of their
brethren in the street, he proceeded without molestation, in a dress,
which, at another season, would have certainly raised a mob at his
heels.

The lady was set down in a street not far from Hanover-square, where
the door being presently opened, she was carried in, and the
gentleman, without any ceremony, walked in after her.

Jones and his companion were now together in a very well-furnished and
well-warmed room; when the female, still speaking in her masquerade
voice, said she was surprized at her friend, who must absolutely have
forgot her appointment; at which, after venting much resentment, she
suddenly exprest some apprehension from Jones, and asked him what the
world would think of their having been alone together in a house at
that time of night? But instead of a direct answer to so important a
question, Jones began to be very importunate with the lady to unmask;
and at length having prevailed, there appeared not Mrs Fitzpatrick,
but the Lady Bellaston herself.

It would be tedious to give the particular conversation, which
consisted of very common and ordinary occurrences, and which lasted
from two till six o'clock in the morning. It is sufficient to mention
all of it that is anywise material to this history. And this was a
promise that the lady would endeavour to find out Sophia, and in a few
days bring him to an interview with her, on condition that he would
then take his leave of her. When this was thoroughly settled, and a
second meeting in the evening appointed at the same place, they
separated; the lady returned to her house, and Jones to his lodgings.



Chapter viii.

Containing a scene of distress, which will appear very extraordinary
to most of our readers.


Jones having refreshed himself with a few hours' sleep, summoned
Partridge to his presence; and delivering him a bank-note of fifty
pounds, ordered him to go and change it. Partridge received this with
sparkling eyes, though, when he came to reflect farther, it raised in
him some suspicions not very advantageous to the honour of his master:
to these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade, the disguise in
which his master had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad
all night, contributed. In plain language, the only way he could
possibly find to account for the possession of this note, was by
robbery: and, to confess the truth, the reader, unless he should
suspect it was owing to the generosity of Lady Bellaston, can hardly
imagine any other.

To clear, therefore, the honour of Mr Jones, and to do justice to the
liberality of the lady, he had really received this present from her,
who, though she did not give much into the hackney charities of the
age, such as building hospitals, &c., was not, however, entirely void
of that Christian virtue; and conceived (very rightly I think) that a
young fellow of merit, without a shilling in the world, was no
improper object of this virtue.

Mr Jones and Mr Nightingale had been invited to dine this day with Mrs
Miller. At the appointed hour, therefore, the two young gentlemen,
with the two girls, attended in the parlour, where they waited from
three till almost five before the good woman appeared. She had been
out of town to visit a relation, of whom, at her return, she gave the
following account.

"I hope, gentlemen, you will pardon my making you wait; I am sure if
you knew the occasion--I have been to see a cousin of mine, about six
miles off, who now lies in.--It should be a warning to all persons
(says she, looking at her daughters) how they marry indiscreetly.
There is no happiness in this world without a competency. O Nancy! how
shall I describe the wretched condition in which I found your poor
cousin? she hath scarce lain in a week, and there was she, this
dreadful weather, in a cold room, without any curtains to her bed, and
not a bushel of coals in her house to supply her with fire; her second
son, that sweet little fellow, lies ill of a quinzy in the same bed
with his mother; for there is no other bed in the house. Poor little
Tommy! I believe, Nancy, you will never see your favourite any more;
for he is really very ill. The rest of the children are in pretty good
health: but Molly, I am afraid, will do herself an injury: she is but
thirteen years old, Mr Nightingale, and yet, in my life, I never saw a
better nurse: she tends both her mother and her brother; and, what is
wonderful in a creature so young, she shows all the chearfulness in
the world to her mother; and yet I saw her--I saw the poor child, Mr
Nightingale, turn about, and privately wipe the tears from her eyes."
Here Mrs Miller was prevented, by her own tears, from going on, and
there was not, I believe, a person present who did not accompany her
in them; at length she a little recovered herself, and proceeded thus:
"In all this distress the mother supports her spirits in a surprizing
manner. The danger of her son sits heaviest upon her, and yet she
endeavours as much as possible to conceal even this concern, on her
husband's account. Her grief, however, sometimes gets the better of
all her endeavours; for she was always extravagantly fond of this boy,
and a most sensible, sweet-tave no confinement, nothing of that kind attempted."

"Well, well," cries the squire, "nothing of that kind shall be
attempted; we will try a little longer what fair means will effect;
and if this fellow be but hanged out of the way--Tol lol de rol! I
never heard better news in my life--I warrant everything goes to my
mind.--Do, prithee, dear Allworthy, come and dine with me at the
Hercules Pillars: I have bespoke a shoulder of mutton roasted, and a
spare-rib of pork, and a fowl and egg-sauce. There will be nobody but
ourselves, unless we have a mind to have the landlord; for I have sent
Parson Supple down to Basingstoke after my tobacco-box, which I left
at an inn there, and I would not lose it for the world; for it is an
old acquaintance of above twenty years' standing. I can tell you
landlord is a vast comical bitch, you will like un hugely."

Mr Allworthy at last agreed to this invitation, and soon after the
squire went off, singing and capering at the hopes of seeing the
speedy tragical end of poor Jones.

When he was gone, Mr Allworthy resumed the aforesaid subject with much
gravity. He told his nephew, "He wished with all his heart he would
endeavour to conquer a passion, in which I cannot," says he, "flatter
you with any hopes of succeeding. It is certainly a vulgar error, that
aversion in a woman may be conquered by perseverance. Indifference
may, perhaps, sometimes yield to it; but the usual triumphs gained by
perseverance in a lover are over caprice, prudence, affectation, and
often an exorbitant degree of levity, which excites women not
over-warm in their constitutions to indulge their vanity by prolonging
the time of courtship, even when they are well enough pleased with the
object, and resolve (if they ever resolve at all) to make him a very
pitiful amends in the end. But a fixed dislike, as I am afraid this
is, will rather gather strength than be conquered by time. Besides, my
dear, I have another apprehension which you must excuse. I am afraid
this passion which you have for this fine young creature hath her
beautiful person too much for its object, and is unworthy of the name
of that love which is the only foundation of matrimonial felicity. To
admire, to like, and to long for the possession of a beautiful woman,
without any regard to her sentiments towards us, is, I am afraid, too
natural; but love, I believe, is the child of love only; at least, I
am pretty confident that to love the creature who we are assured hates
us is not in human nature. Examine your heart, therefore, thoroughly,
my good boy, and if, upon examination, you have but the least
suspicion of this kind, I am sure your own virtue and religion will
impel you to drive so vicious a passion from your heart, and your good
sense will soon enable you to do it without pain."

The reader may pretty well guess Blifil's answer; but, if he should be
at a loss, we are not at present at leisure to satisfy him, as our
history now hastens on to matters of higher importance, and we can no
longer bear to be absent from Sophia.



Chapter iv.

An extraordinary scene between Sophia and her aunt.


The lowing heifer and the bleating ewe, in herds and flocks, may
ramble safe and unregarded through the pastures. These are, indeed,
hereafter doomed to be the prey of man; yet many years are they
suffered to enjoy their liberty undisturbed. But if a plump doe be
discovered to have escaped from the forest, and to repose herself in
some field or grove, the whole parish is presently alarmed, every man
is ready to set his dogs after her; and, if she is preserved from the
rest by the good squire, it is only that he may secure her for his own
eating.

I have often considered a very fine young woman of fortune and
fashion, when first found strayed from the pale of her nursery, to be
in pretty much the same situation with this doe. The town is
immediately in an uproar; she is hunted from park to play, from court
to assembly, from assembly to her own chamber, and rarely escapes a
single season from the jaws of some devourer or other; for, if her
friends protect her from some, it is only to deliver her over to one
of their own chusing, often more disagreeable to her than any of the
rest; while whole herds or flocks of other women securely, and scarce
regarded, traverse the park, the play, the opera, and the assembly;
and though, for the most part at least, they are at last devoured, yet
for a long time do they wanton in liberty, without disturbance or
controul.

Of all these paragons none ever tasted more of this persecution than
poor Sophia. Her ill stars were not contented with all that she had
suffered on account of Blifil, they now raised her another pursuer,
who seemed likely to torment her no less than the other had done. For
though her aunt was less violent, she was no less assiduous in teizing
her, than her father had been before.

The servants were no sooner departed after dinner than Mrs Western,
who had opened the matter to Sophia, informed her, "That she expected
his lordship that very afternoon, and intended to take the first
opportunity of leaving her alone with him." "If you do, madam,"
answered Sophia, with some spirit, "I shall take the first opportunity
of leaving him by himself." "How! madam!" cries the aunt; "is this the
return you make me for my kindness in relieving you from your
confinement at your father's?" "You know, madam," said Sophia, "the
cause of that confinement was a refusal to comply with my father in
accepting a man I detested; and will my dear aunt, who hath relieved
me from that distress, involve me in another equally bad?" "And do you
think then, madam," answered Mrs Western, "that there is no difference
between my Lord Fellamar and Mr Blifil?" "Very little, in my opinion,"
cries Sophia; "and, if I must be condemned to one, I would certainly
have the merit of sacrificing myself to my father's pleasure." "Then
my pleasure, I find," said the aunt, "hath very little weight with
you; but that consideration shall not move me. I act from nobler
motives. The view of aggrandizing my family, of ennobling yourself, is
what I proceed upon. Have you no sense of ambition? Are there no
charms in the thoughts of having a coronet on your coach?" "None, upon
my honour," said Sophia. "A pincushion upon my coach would please me
just as well." "Never mention honour," cries the aunt. "It becomes not
the mouth of such a wretch. I am sorry, niece, you force me to use
these words, but I cannot bear your groveling temper; you have none of
the blood of the Westerns in you. But, however mean and base your own
ideas are, you shall bring no imputation on mine. I will never suffer
the world to say of me that I encouraged you in refusing one of the
best matches in England; a match which, besides its advantage in
fortune, would do honour to almost any family, and hath, indeed, in
title, the advantage of ours." "Surely," says Sophia, "I am born
deficient, and have not the senses with which other people are
blessed; there must be certainly some sense which can relish the
delights of sound and show, which I have not; for surely mankind would
not labour so much, nor sacrifice so much for the obtaining, nor would
they be so elate and proud with possessing, what appeared to them, as
it doth to me, the most insignificant of all trifles."

"No, no, miss," cries the aunt; "you are born with as many senses as
other people; but I assure you you are not born with a sufficient
understanding to make a fool of me, or to expose my conduct to the
world; so I declare this to you, upon my word, and you know, I
believe, how fixed my resolutions are, unless you agree to see his
lordship this afternoon, I will, with my own hands, deliver you
to-morrow morning to my brother, and will never henceforth interfere
with you, nor see your face again." Sophia stood a few moments silent
after this speech, which was uttered in a most angry and peremptory
tone; and then, bursting into tears, she cryed, "Do with me, madam,
whatever you please; I am the most miserable undone wretch upon earth;
if my dear aunt forsakes me where shall I look for a protector?" "My
dear niece," cries she, "you will have a very good protector in his
lordship; a protector whom nothing but a hankering after that vile
fellow Jones can make you decline." "Indeed, madam," said Sophia, "you
wrong me. How can you imagine, after what you have shewn me, if I had
ever any such thoughts, that I should not banish them for ever? If it
will satisfy you, I will receive the sacrament upon it never to see
his face again." "But, child, dear child," said the aunt, "be
reasonable; can you invent a single objection?" "I have already, I
think, told you a sufficient objection," answered Sophia. "What?"
cries the aunt; "I remember none." "Sure, madam," said Sophia, "I told
you he had used me in the rudest and vilest manner." "Indeed, child,"
answered she, "I never heard you, or did not understand you:--but what
do you mean by this rude, vile manner?" "Indeed, madam," said Sophia,
"I am almost ashamed to tell you. He caught me in his arms, pulled me
down upon the settee, and thrust his hand into my bosom, and kissed it
with such violence that I have the mark upon my left breast at this
moment." "Indeed!" said Mrs Western. "Yes, indeed, madam," answered
Sophia; "my father luckily came in at that instant, or Heaven knows
what rudeness he intended to have proceeded to." "I am astonished and
confounded," cries the aunt. "No woman of the name of Western hath
been ever treated so since we were a family. I would have torn the
eyes of a prince out, if he had attempted such freedoms with me. It is
impossible! sure, Sophia, you must invent this to raise my indignation
against him." "I hope, madam," said Sophia, "you have too good an
opinion of me to imagine me capable of telling an untruth. Upon my
soul it is true." "I should have stabbed him to the heart, had I been
present," returned the aunt. "Yet surely he could have no
dishonourable design; it is impossible! he durst not: besides, his
proposals shew he hath not; for they are not only honourable, but
generous. I don't know; the age allows too great freedoms. A distant
salute is all I would have allowed before the ceremony. I have had
lovers formerly, not so long ago neither; several lovers, though I
never would consent to marriage, and I never encouraged the least
freedom. It is a foolish custom, and what I never would agree to. No
man kissed more of me than my cheek. It is as much as one can bring
oneself to give lips up to a husband; and, indeed, could I ever have
been persuaded to marry, I believe I should not have soon been brought
to endure so much." "You will pardon me, dear madam," said Sophia, "if
I make one observation: you own you have had many lovers, and the
world knows it, even if you should deny it. You refused them all, and,
I am convinced, one coronet at least among them." "You say true, dear
Sophy," answered she; "I had once the offer of a title." "Why, then,"
said Sophia, "will you not suffer me to refuse this once?" "It is
true, child," said she, "I have refused the offer of a title; but it
was not so good an offer; that is, not so very, very good an
offer."--"Yes, madam," said Sophia; "but you have had very great
proposals from men of vast fortunes. It was not the first, nor the
second, nor the third advantageous match that offered itself." "I own
it was not," said she. "Well, madam," continued Sophia, "and why may
not I expect to have a second, perhaps, better than this? You are now
but a young woman, and I am convinced would not promise to yield to
the first lover of fortune, nay, or of title too. I am a very young
woman, and sure I need not despair." "Well, my dear, dear Sophy,"
cries the aunt, "what would you have me say?" "Why, I only beg that I
may not be left alone, at least this evening; grant me that, and I
will submit, if you think, after what is past, I ought to see him in
your company." "Well, I will grant it," cries the aunt. "Sophy, you
know I love you, and can deny you nothing. You know the easiness of my
nature; I have not always been so easy. I have been formerly thought
cruel; by the men, I mean. I was called the cruel Parthenissa. I have
broke many a window that has had verses to the cruel Parthenissa in
it. Sophy, I was never so handsome as you, and yet I had something of
you formerly. I am a little altered. Kingdoms and states, as Tully
Cicero says in his epistles, undergo alterations, and so must the
human form." Thus run she on for near half an hour upon herself, and
her conquests, and her cruelty, till the arrival of my lord, who,
after a most tedious visit, during which Mrs Western never once
offered to leave the room, retired, not much more satisfied with the
aunt than with the niece; for Sophia had brought her aunt into so
excellent a temper, that she consented to almost everything her niece
said; and agreed that a little distant behaviour might not be improper
to so forward a lover.

Thus Sophia, by a little well-directed flattery, for which surely none
will blame her, obtained a little ease for herself, and, at least, put
off the evil day. And now we have seen our heroine in a better
situation than she hath been for a long time before, we will look a
little after Mr Jones, whom we left in the most deplorable situation
that can be well imagined.



Chapter v.

Mrs Miller and Mr Nightingale visit Jones in the prison.


When Mr Allworthy and his nephew went to meet Mr Western, Mrs Miller
set forwards to her son-in-law's lodgings, in order to acquaint him
with the accident which had befallen his friend Jones; but he had
known it long before from Partridge (for Jones, when he left Mrs
Miller, had been furnished with a room in the same house with Mr
Nightingale). The good woman found her daughter under great affliction
on account of Mr Jones, whom having comforted as well as she could,
she set forwards to the Gatehouse, where she heard he was, and where
Mr Nightingale was arrived before her.

The firmness and constancy of a true friend is a circumstance so
extremely delightful to persons in any kind of distress, that the
distress itself, if it be only temporary, and admits of relief, is
more than compensated by bringing this comfort with it. Nor are
instances of this kind so rare as some superficial and inaccurate
observers have reported. To say the truth, want of compassion is not
to be numbered among our general faults. The black ingredient which
fouls our disposition is envy. Hence our eye is seldom, I am afraid,
turned upward to those who are manifestly greater, better, wiser, or
happier than ourselves, without some degree of malignity; while we
commonly look downwards on the mean and miserable with sufficient
benevolence and pity. In fact, I have remarked, that most of the
defects which have discovered themselves in the friendships within my
observation have arisen from envy only: a hellish vice; and yet one
from which I have known very few absolutely exempt. But enough of a
subject which, if pursued, would lead me too far.

Whether it was that Fortune was apprehensive lest Jones should sink
under the weight of his adversity, and that she might thus lose any
future opportunity of tormenting him, or whether she really abated
somewhat of her severity towards him, she seemed a little to relax her
persecution, by sending him the company of two such faithful friends,
and what is perhaps more rare, a faithful servant. For Partridge,
though he had many imperfections, wanted not fidelity; and though fear
would not suffer him to be hanged for his master, yet the world, I
believe, could not have bribed him to desert his cause.

While Jones was expressing great satisfaction in the presence of his
friends, Partridge brought an account that Mr Fitzpatrick was still
alive, though the surgeon declared that he had very little hopes. Upon
which, Jones fetching a deep sigh, Nightingale said to him, "My dear
Tom, why should you afflict yourself so upon an accident, which,
whatever be the consequence, can be attended with no danger to you,
and in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been the
least to blame? If the fellow should die, what have you done more than
taken away the life of a ruffian in your own defence? So will the
coroner's inquest certainly find it; and then you will be easily
admitted to bail; and, though you must undergo the form of a trial,
yet it is a trial which many men would stand for you for a shilling."
"Come, come, Mr Jones," says Mrs Miller, "chear yourself up. I knew
you could not be the aggressor, and so I told Mr Allworthy, and so he
shall acknowledge too, before I have done with him."

Jones gravely answered, "That whatever might be his fate, he
should always lament the having shed the blood of one of his
fellow-creatures, as one of the highest misfortunes which could
have befallen him. But I have another misfortune of the tenderest
kind----O! Mrs Miller, I have lost what I held most dear upon earth."
"That must be a mistress," said Mrs Miller; "but come, come; I know
more than you imagine" (for indeed Partridge had blabbed all); "and I
have heard more than you know. Matters go better, I promise you, than
you think; and I would not give Blifil sixpence for all the chance
which he hath of the lady."

"Indeed, my dear friend, indeed," answered Jones, "you are an entire
stranger to the cause of my grief. If you was acquainted with the
story, you would allow my case admitted of no comfort. I apprehend no
danger from Blifil. I have undone myself." "Don't despair," replied
Mrs Miller; "you know not what a woman can do; and if anything be in
my power, I promise you I will do it to serve you. It is my duty. My
son, my dear Mr Nightingale, who is so kind to tell me he hath
obligations to you on the same account, knows it is my duty. Shall I
go to the lady myself? I will say anything to her you would have me
say."

"Thou best of women," cries Jones, taking her by the hand, "talk not
of obligations to me;--but as you have been so kind to mention it,
there is a favour which, perhaps, may be in your power. I see you are
acquainted with the lady (how you came by your information I know
not), who sits, indeed, very near my heart. If you could contrive to
deliver this (giving her a paper from his pocket), I shall for ever
acknowledge your goodness."

"Give it me," said Mrs Miller. "If I see it not in her own possession
before I sleep, may my next sleep be my last! Comfort yourself, my
good young man! be wise enough to take warning from past follies, and
I warrant all shall be well, and I shall yet see you happy with the
most charming young lady in the world; for I so hear from every one
she is."

"Believe me, madam," said he, "I do not speak the common cant of one
in my unhappy situation. Before this dreadful accident happened, I had
resolved to quit a life of which I was become sensible of the
wickedness as well as folly. I do assure you, notwithstanding the
disturbances I have unfortunately occasioned in your house, for which
I heartily ask your pardon, I am not an abandoned profligate. Though I
have been hurried into vices, I do not approve a vicious character,
nor will I ever, from this moment, deserve it."

Mrs Miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations, in the
sincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith; and now the
remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good
woman and Mr Nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of Mr Jones, in
which they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and
satisfied than they found him; to which happy alteration nothing so
much contributed as the kind undertaking of Mrs Miller to deliver his
letter to Sophia, which he despaired of finding any means to
accomplish; for when Black George produced the last from Sophia, he
informed Partridge that she had strictly charged him, on pain of
having it communicated to her father, not to bring her any answer. He
was, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate
to Mr Allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one
of the worthiest creatures in the world.

After about an hour's visit from the lady (for Nightingale had been
with him much longer), they both took their leave, promising to return
to him soon; during which Mrs Miller said she hoped to bring him some
good news from his mistress, and Mr Nightingale promised to enquire
into the state of Mr Fitzpatrick's wound, and likewise to find out
some of the persons who were present at the rencounter.

The former of these went directly in quest of Sophia, whither we
likewise shall now attend her.



Chapter vi.

In which Mrs Miller pays a visit to Sophia.


Access to the young lady was by no means difficult; for, as she lived
now on a perfect friendly footing with her aunt, she was at full
liberty to receive what visitants she pleased.

Sophia was dressing when she was acquainted that there was a
gentlewoman below to wait on her. As she was neither afraid, nor
ashamed, to see any of her own sex, Mrs Miller was immediately
admitted.

Curtsies and the usual ceremonials between women who are strangers to
each other, being past, Sophia said, "I have not the pleasure to know
you, madam." "No, madam," answered Mrs Miller, "and I must beg pardon
for intruding upon you. But when you know what has induced me to give
you this trouble, I hope----" "Pray, what is your business, madam?"
said Sophia, with a little emotion. "Madam, we are not alone," replied
Mrs Miller, in a low voice. "Go out, Betty," said Sophia.

When Betty was departed, Mrs Miller said, "I was desired, madam, by a
very unhappy young gentleman, to deliver you this letter." Sophia
changed colour when she saw the direction, well knowing the hand, and
after some hesitation, said--"I could not conceive, madam, from your
appearance, that your business had been of such a nature.--Whomever
you brought this letter from, I shall not open it. I should be sorry
to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one; but you are an utter
stranger to me."

"If you will have patience, madam," answered Mrs Miller, "I will
acquaint you who I am, and how I came by that letter." "I have no
curiosity, madam, to know anything," cries Sophia; "but I must insist
on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you."

Mrs Miller then fell upon her knees, and in the most passionate terms
implored her compassion; to which Sophia answered: "Sure, madam, it is
surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of
this person. I would not think, madam"--"No, madam," says Mrs Miller,
"you shall not think anything but the truth. I will tell you all, and
you will not wonder that I am interested. He is the best-natured
creature that ever was born."--She then began and related the story of
Mr Anderson.--After this she cried, "This, madam, this is his
goodness; but I have much more tender obligations to him. He hath
preserved my child."--Here, after shedding some tears, she related
everything concerning that fact, suppressing only those circumstances
which would have most reflected on her daughter, and concluded with
saying, "Now, madam, you shall judge whether I can ever do enough for
so kind, so good, so generous a young man; and sure he is the best and
worthiest of all human beings."

The alterations in the countenance of Sophia had hitherto been chiefly
to her disadvantage, and had inclined her complexion to too great
paleness; but she now waxed redder, if possible, than vermilion, and
cried, "I know not what to say; certainly what arises from gratitude
cannot be blamed--But what service can my reading this letter do your
friend, since I am resolved never----" Mrs Miller fell again to her
entreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but she could not, she said,
carry it back. "Well, madam," says Sophia, "I cannot help it, if you
will force it upon me.--Certainly you may leave it whether I will or
no." What Sophia meant, or whether she meant anything, I will not
presume to determine; but Mrs Miller actually understood this as a
hint, and presently laying the letter down on the table, took her
leave, having first begged permission to wait again on Sophia; which
request had neither assent nor denial.

The letter lay upon the table no longer than till Mrs Miller was out
of sight; for then Sophia opened and read it.

This letter did very little service to his cause; for it consisted of
little more than confessions of his own unworthiness, and bitter
lamentations of despair, together with the most solemn protestations
of his unalterable fidelity to Sophia, of which, he said, he hoped to
convince her, if he had ever more the honour of being admitted to her
presence; and that he could account for the letter to Lady Bellaston
in such a manner, that, though it would not entitle him to her
forgiveness, he hoped at least to obtain it from her mercy. And
concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his thoughts than
to marry Lady Bellaston.

Though Sophia read the letter twice over with great attention, his
meaning still remained a riddle to her; nor could her invention
suggest to her any means to excuse Jones. She certainly remained very
angry with him, though indeed Lady Bellaston took up so much of her
resentment, that her gentle mind had but little left to bestow on any
other person.

That lady was most unluckily to dine this very day with her aunt
Western, and in the afternoon they were all three, by appointment, to
go together to the opera, and thence to Lady Thomas Hatchet's drum.
Sophia would have gladly been excused from all, but would not
disoblige her aunt; and as to the arts of counterfeiting illness, she
was so entirely a stranger to them, that it never once entered into
her head. When she was drest, therefore, down she went, resolved to
encounter all the horrors of the day, and a most disagreeable one it
proved; for Lady Bellaston took every opportunity very civilly and
slily to insult her; to all which her dejection of spirits disabled
her from making any return; and, indeed, to confess the truth, she was
at the very best but an indifferent mistress of repartee.

Another misfortune which befel poor Sophia was the company of Lord
Fellamar, whom she met at the opera, and who attended her to the drum.
And though both places were too publick to admit of any
particularities, and she was farther relieved by the musick at the one
place, and by the cards at the other, she could not, however, enjoy
herself in his company; for there is something of delicacy in women,
which will not suffer them to be even easy in the presence of a man
whom they know to have pretensions to them which they are disinclined
to favour.

Having in this chapter twice mentioned a drum, a word which our
posterity, it is hoped, will not understand in the sense it is here
applied, we shall, notwithstanding our present haste, stop a moment to
describe the entertainment here meant, and the rather as we can in a
moment describe it.

A drum, then, is an assembly of well-dressed persons of both sexes,
most of whom play at cards, and the rest do nothing at all; while the
mistress of the house performs the part of the landlady at an inn, and
like the landlady of an inn prides herself in the number of her
guests, though she doth not always, like her, get anything by it.

No wonder then, as so much spirits must be required to support any
vivacity in these scenes of dulness, that we hear persons of fashion
eternally complaining of the want of them; a complaint confined
entirely to upper life. How insupportable must we imagine this round
of impertinence to have been to Sophia at this time; how difficult
must she have found it to force the appearance of gaiety into her
looks, when her mind dictated nothing but the tenderest sorrow, and
when every thought was charged with tormenting ideas!

Night, however, at last restored her to her pillow, where we will
leave her to soothe her melancholy at least, though incapable we fear
of rest, and shall pursue our history, which, something whispers us,
is now arrived at the eve of some great event.



Chapter vii.

A pathetic scene between Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller.


Mrs Miller had a long discourse with Mr Allworthy, at his return from
dinner, in which she acquainted him with Jones's having unfortunately
lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation;
and with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him; of all
which she had received a full account from the faithful retailer
Partridge. She then explained the obligations she had to Jones; not
that she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter; for though
she had the utmost confidence in Mr Allworthy, and though there could
be no hopes of keeping an affair secret which was unhappily known to
more than half a dozen, yet she could not prevail with herself to
mention those circumstances which reflected most on the chastity of
poor Nancy, but smothered that part of her evidence as cautiously as
if she had been before a judge, and the girl was now on her trial for
the murder of a bastard.

Allworthy said, there were few characters so absolutely vicious as not
to have the least mixture of good in them. "However," says he, "I
cannot deny but that you have some obligations to the fellow, bad as
he is, and I shall therefore excuse what hath past already, but must
insist you never mention his name to me more; for, I promise you, it
was upon the fullest and plainest evidence that I resolved to take the
measures I have taken." "Well, sir," says she, "I make not the least
doubt but time will shew all matters in their true and natural
colours, and that you will be convinced this poor young man deserves
better of you than some other folks that shall be nameless."

"Madam," cries Allworthy, a little ruffled, "I will not hear any
reflections on my nephew; and if ever you say a word more of that
kind, I will depart from your house that instant. He is the worthiest
and best of men; and I once more repeat it to you, he hath carried his
friendship to this man to a blameable length, by too long concealing
facts of the blackest die. The ingratitude of the wretch to this good
young man is what I most resent; for, madam, I have the greatest
reason to imagine he had laid a plot to supplant my nephew in my
favour, and to have disinherited him."

"I am sure, sir," answered Mrs Miller, a little frightened (for,
though Mr Allworthy had the utmost sweetness and benevolence in his
smiles, he had great terror in his frowns), "I shall never speak
against any gentleman you are pleased to think well of. I am sure,
sir, such behaviour would very little become me, especially when the
gentleman is your nearest relation; but, sir, you must not be angry
with me, you must not indeed, for my good wishes to this poor wretch.
Sure I may call him so now, though once you would have been angry with
me if I had spoke of him with the least disrespect. How often have I
heard you call him your son? How often have you prattled to me of him
with all the fondness of a parent? Nay, sir, I cannot forget the many
tender expressions, the many good things you have told me of his
beauty, and his parts, and his virtues; of his good-nature and
generosity. I am sure, sir, I cannot forget them, for I find them all
true. I have experienced them in my own cause. They have preserved my
family. You must pardon my tears, sir, indeed you must. When I
consider the cruel reverse of fortune which this poor youth, to whom I
am so much obliged, hath suffered; when I consider the loss of your
favour, which I know he valued more than his life, I must, I must
lament him. If you had a dagger in your hand, ready to plunge into my
heart, I must lament the misery of one whom you have loved, and I
shall ever love."

Allworthy was pretty much moved with this speech, but it seemed not to
be with anger; for, after a short silence, taking Mrs Miller by the
hand, he said very affectionately to her, "Come, madam, let us
consider a little about your daughter. I cannot blame you for
rejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her, but you
know this advantage, in a great measure, depends on the father's
reconciliation. I know Mr Nightingale very well, and have formerly had
concerns with him; I will make him a visit, and endeavour to serve you
in this matter. I believe he is a worldly man; but as this is an only
son, and the thing is now irretrievable, perhaps he may in time be
brought to reason. I promise you I will do all I can for you."

Many were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to Allworthy
for this kind and generous offer, nor could she refrain from taking
this occasion again to express her gratitude towards Jones, "to whom,"
said she, "I owe the opportunity of giving you, sir, this present
trouble." Allworthy gently stopped her; but he was too good a man to
be really offended with the effects of so noble a principle as now
actuated Mrs Miller; and indeed, had not this new affair inflamed his
former anger against Jones, it is possible he might have been a little
softened towards him, by the report of an action which malice itself
could not have derived from an evil motive.

Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller had been above an hour together, when
their conversation was put an end to by the arrival of Blifil and
another person, which other person was no less than Mr Dowling, the
attorney, who was now become a great favourite with Mr Blifil, and
whom Mr Allworthy, at the desire of his nephew, had made his steward;
and had likewise recommended him to Mr Western, from whom the attorney
received a promise of being promoted to the same office upon the first
vacancy; and, in the meantime, was employed in transacting some
affairs which the squire then had in London in relation to a mortgage.

This was the principal affair which then brought Mr Dowling to town;
therefore he took the same opportunity to charge himself with some
money for Mr Allworthy, and to make a report to him of some other
business; in all which, as it was of much too dull a nature to find
any place in this history, we will leave the uncle, nephew, and their
lawyer concerned, and resort to other matters.



Chapter viii.

Containing various matters.


Before we return to Mr Jones, we will take one more view of Sophia.

Though that young lady had brought her aunt into great good humour by
those soothing methods which we have before related, she had not
brought her in the least to abate of her zeal for the match with Lord
Fellamar. This zeal was now inflamed by Lady Bellaston, who had told
her the preceding evening, that she was well satisfied from the
conduct of Sophia, and from her carriage to his lordship, that all
delays would be dangerous, and that the only way to succeed was to
press the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should
have no time to reflect, and be obliged to consent while she scarce
knew what she did; in which manner, she said, one-half of the
marriages among people of condition were brought about. A fact very
probably true, and to which, I suppose, is owing the mutual tenderness
which afterwards exists among so many happy couples.

A hint of the same kind was given by the same lady to Lord Fellamar;
and both these so readily embraced the advice that the very next day
was, at his lordship's request, appointed by Mrs Western for a private
interview between the young parties. This was communicated to Sophia
by her aunt, and insisted upon in such high terms, that, after having
urged everything she possibly could invent against it without the
least effect, she at last agreed to give the highest instance of
complacence which any young lady can give, and consented to see his
lordship.

As conversations of this kind afford no great entertainment, we shall
be excused from reciting the whole that past at this interview; in
which, after his lordship had made many declarations of the most pure
and ardent passion to the silent blushing Sophia, she at last
collected all the spirits she could raise, and with a trembling low
voice said, "My lord, you must be yourself conscious whether your
former behaviour to me hath been consistent with the professions you
now make." "Is there," answered he, "no way by which I can atone for
madness? what I did I am afraid must have too plainly convinced you,
that the violence of love had deprived me of my senses." "Indeed, my
lord," said she, "it is in your power to give me a proof of an
affection which I much rather wish to encourage, and to which I should
think myself more beholden." "Name it, madam," said my lord, very
warmly. "My lord," says she, looking down upon her fan, "I know you
must be sensible how uneasy this pretended passion of yours hath made
me." "Can you be so cruel to call it pretended?" says he. "Yes, my
lord," answered Sophia, "all professions of love to those whom we
persecute are most insulting pretences. This pursuit of yours is to me
a most cruel persecution: nay, it is taking a most ungenerous
advantage of my unhappy situation." "Most lovely, most adorable
charmer, do not accuse me," cries he, "of taking an ungenerous
advantage, while I have no thoughts but what are directed to your
honour and interest, and while I have no view, no hope, no ambition,
but to throw myself, honour, fortune, everything at your feet." "My
lord," says she, "it is that fortune and those honours which gave you
the advantage of which I complain. These are the charms which have
seduced my relations, but to me they are things indifferent. If your
lordship will merit my gratitude, there is but one way." "Pardon me,
divine creature," said he, "there can be none. All I can do for you is
so much your due, and will give me so much pleasure, that there is no
room for your gratitude." "Indeed, my lord," answered she, "you may
obtain my gratitude, my good opinion, every kind thought and wish
which it is in my power to bestow; nay, you may obtain them with ease,
for sure to a generous mind it must be easy to grant my request. Let
me beseech you, then, to cease a pursuit in which you can never have
any success. For your own sake as well as mine I entreat this favour;
for sure you are too noble to have any pleasure in tormenting an
unhappy creature. What can your lordship propose but uneasiness to
yourself, by a perseverance, which, upon my honour, upon my soul,
cannot, shall not prevail with me, whatever distresses you may drive
me to." Here my lord fetched a deep sigh, and then said--"Is it then,
madam, that I am so unhappy to be the object of your dislike and
scorn; or will you pardon me if I suspect there is some other?" Here
he hesitated, and Sophia answered with some spirit, "My lord, I shall
not be accountable to you for the reasons of my conduct. I am obliged
to your lordship for the generous offer you have made; I own it is
beyond either my deserts or expectations; yet I hope, my lord, you
will not insist on my reasons, when I declare I cannot accept it."
Lord Fellamar returned much to this, which we do not perfectly
understand, and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either
to sense or grammar; but he concluded his ranting speech with saying,
"That if she had pre-engaged herself to any gentleman, however unhappy
it would make him, he should think himself bound in honour to desist."
Perhaps my lord laid too much emphasis on the word gentleman; for we
cannot else well account for the indignation with which he inspired
Sophia, who, in her answer, seemed greatly to resent some affront he
had given her.

While she was speaking, with her voice more raised than usual, Mrs
Western came into the room, the fire glaring in her cheeks, and the
flames bursting from her eyes. "I am ashamed," says she, "my lord, of
the reception which you have met with. I assure your lordship we are
all sensible of the honour done us; and I must tell you, Miss Western,
the family expect a different behaviour from you." Here my lord
interfered on behalf of the young lady, but to no purpose; the aunt
proceeded till Sophia pulled out her handkerchief, threw herself into
a chair, and burst into a violent fit of tears.

The remainder of the conversation between Mrs Western and his
lordship, till the latter withdrew, consisted of bitter lamentations
on his side, and on hers of the strongest assurances that her niece
should and would consent to all he wished. "Indeed, my lord," says
she, "the girl hath had a foolish education, neither adapted to her
fortune nor her family. Her father, I am sorry to say it, is to blame
for everything. The girl hath silly country notions of bashfulness.
Nothing else, my lord, upon my honour; I am convinced she hath a good
understanding at the bottom, and will be brought to reason."

This last speech was made in the absence of Sophia; for she had some
time before left the room, with more appearance of passion than she
had ever shown on any occasion; and now his lordship, after many
expressions of thanks to Mrs Western, many ardent professions of
passion which nothing could conquer, and many assurances of
perseverance, which Mrs Western highly encouraged, took his leave for
this time.

Before we relate what now passed between Mrs Western and Sophia, it
may be proper to mention an unfortunate accident which had happened,
and which had occasioned the return of Mrs Western with so much fury,
as we have seen.

The reader then must know that the maid who at present attended on
Sophia was recommended by Lady Bellaston, with whom she had lived for
some time in the capacity of a comb-brush: she was a very sensible
girl, and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young
lady very carefully. These instructions, we are sorry to say, were
communicated to her by Mrs Honour, into whose favour Lady Bellaston
had now so ingratiated herself, that the violent affection which the
good waiting-woman had formerly borne to Sophia was entirely
obliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new
mistress.

Now, when Mrs Miller was departed, Betty (for that was the name of the
girl), returning to her young lady, found her very attentively engaged
in reading a long letter, and the visible emotions which she betrayed
on that occasion might have well accounted for some suspicions which
the girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger foundation,
for she had overheard the whole scene which passed between Sophia and
Mrs Miller.

Mrs Western was acquainted with all this matter by Betty, who, after
receiving many commendations and some rewards for her fidelity, was
ordered, that, if the woman who brought the letter came again, she
should introduce her to Mrs Western herself.

Unluckily, Mrs Miller returned at the very time when Sophia was
engaged with his lordship. Betty, according to order, sent her
directly to the aunt; who, being mistress of so many circumstances
relating to what had past the day before, easily imposed upon the poor
woman to believe that Sophia had communicated the whole affair; and so
pumped everything out of her which she knew relating to the letter and
relating to Jones.

This poor creature might, indeed, be called simplicity itself. She was
one of that order of mortals who are apt to believe everything which
is said to them; to whom nature hath neither indulged the offensive
nor defensive weapons of deceit, and who are consequently liable to be
imposed upon by any one who will only be at the expense of a little
falshood for that purpose. Mrs Western, having drained Mrs Miller of
all she knew, which, indeed, was but little, but which was sufficient
to make the aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed her with assurances
that Sophia would not see her, that she would send no answer to the
letter, nor ever receive another; nor did she suffer her to depart
without a handsome lecture on the merits of an office to which she
could afford no better name than that of procuress.--This discovery
had greatly discomposed her temper, when, coming into the apartment
next to that in which the lovers were, she overheard Sophia very
warmly protesting against his lordship's addresses. At which the rage
already kindled burst forth, and she rushed in upon her niece in a
most furious manner, as we have already described, together with what
past at that time till his lordship's departure.

No sooner was Lord Fellamar gone than Mrs Western returned to Sophia,
whom she upbraided in the most bitter terms for the ill use she had
made of the confidence reposed in her; and for her treachery in
conversing with a man with whom she had offered but the day before to
bind herself in the most solemn oath never more to have any
conversation. Sophia protested she had maintained no such
conversation. "How, how! Miss Western," said the aunt; "will you deny
your receiving a letter from him yesterday?" "A letter, madam!"
answered Sophia, somewhat surprized. "It is not very well bred, miss,"
replies the aunt, "to repeat my words. I say a letter, and I insist
upon your showing it me immediately." "I scorn a lie, madam," said
Sophia; "I did receive a letter, but it was without my desire, and,
indeed, I may say, against my consent." "Indeed, indeed, miss," cries
the aunt, "you ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at
all; but where is the letter? for I will see it."

To this peremptory demand, Sophia paused some time before she returned
an answer; and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not
the letter in her pocket, which was, indeed, true; upon which her
aunt, losing all manner of patience, asked her niece this short
question, whether she would resolve to marry Lord Fellamar, or no? to
which she received the strongest negative. Mrs Western then replied
with an oath, or something very like one, that she would early the
next morning deliver her back into her father's hand.

Sophia then began to reason with her aunt in the following
manner:--"Why, madam, must I of necessity be forced to marry at all?
Consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own case, and how
much kinder your parents were in leaving you to your liberty. What
have I done to forfeit this liberty? I will never marry contrary to my
father's consent, nor without asking yours----And when I ask the
consent of either improperly, it will be then time enough to force
some other marriage upon me." "Can I bear to hear this," cries Mrs
Western, "from a girl who hath now a letter from a murderer in her
pocket?" "I have no such letter, I promise you," answered Sophia;
"and, if he be a murderer, he will soon be in no condition to give you
any further disturbance." "How, Miss Western!" said the aunt, "have
you the assurance to speak of him in this manner; to own your
affection for such a villain to my face?" "Sure, madam," said Sophia,
"you put a very strange construction on my words." "Indeed, Miss
Western," cries the lady, "I shall not bear this usage; you have
learnt of your father this manner of treating me; he hath taught you
to give me the lie. He hath totally ruined you by this false system of
education; and, please heaven, he shall have the comfort of its
fruits; for once more I declare to you, that to-morrow morning I will
carry you back. I will withdraw all my forces from the field, and
remain henceforth, like the wise king of Prussia, in a state of
perfect neutrality. You are both too wise to be regulated by my
measures; so prepare yourself, for to-morrow morning you shall
evacuate this house."

Sophia remonstrated all she could; but her aunt was deaf to all she
said. In this resolution therefore we must at present leave her, as
there seems to be no hopes of bringing her to change it.



Chapter ix.

What happened to Mr Jones in the prison.


Mr Jones passed about twenty-four melancholy hours by himself, unless
when relieved by the company of Partridge, before Mr Nightingale
returned; not that this worthy young man had deserted or forgot his
friend; for, indeed, he had been much the greatest part of the time
employed in his service.

He had heard, upon enquiry, that the only persons who had seen the
beginning of the unfortunate rencounter were a crew belonging to a
man-of-war which then lay at Deptford. To Deptford therefore he went
in search of this crew, where he was informed that the men he sought
after were all gone ashore. He then traced them from place to place,
till at last he found two of them drinking together, with a third
person, at a hedge-tavern near Aldersgate.

Nightingale desired to speak with Jones by himself (for Partridge was
in the room when he came in). As soon as they were alone, Nightingale,
taking Jones by the hand, cried, "Come, my brave friend, be not too
much dejected at what I am going to tell you----I am sorry I am the
messenger of bad news; but I think it my duty to tell you." "I guess
already what that bad news is," cries Jones. "The poor gentleman then
is dead."--"I hope not," answered Nightingale. "He was alive this
morning; though I will not flatter you; I fear, from the accounts I
could get, that his wound is mortal. But if the affair be exactly as
you told it, your own remorse would be all you would have reason to
apprehend, let what would happen; but forgive me, my dear Tom, if I
entreat you to make the worst of your story to your friends. If you
disguise anything to us, you will only be an enemy to yourself."

"What reason, my dear Jack, have I ever given you," said Jones, "to
stab me with so cruel a suspicion?" "Have patience," cries
Nightingale, "and I will tell you all. After the most diligent enquiry
I could make, I at last met with two of the fellows who were present
at this unhappy accident, and I am sorry to say, they do not relate
the story so much in your favour as you yourself have told it." "Why,
what do they say?" cries Jones. "Indeed what I am sorry to repeat, as
I am afraid of the consequence of it to you. They say that they were
at too great a distanovery from some diseases; so anger,
when removed, often gives new life to affection. This was the case of
Mr Allworthy; for Blifil having wiped off the greater suspicion, the
lesser, which had been raised by Square's letter, sunk of course, and
was forgotten; and Thwackum, with whom he was greatly offended, bore
alone all the reflections which Square had cast on the enemies of
Jones.

As for that young man, the resentment of Mr Allworthy began more and
more to abate towards him. He told Blifil, "He did not only forgive
the extraordinary efforts of his good-nature, but would give him the
pleasure of following his example." Then, turning to Mrs Miller with a
smile which would have become an angel, he cryed, "What say you,
madam? shall we take a hackney-coach, and all of us together pay a
visit to your friend? I promise you it is not the first visit I have
made in a prison."

Every reader, I believe, will be able to answer for the worthy woman;
but they must have a great deal of good-nature, and be well acquainted
with friendship, who can feel what she felt on this occasion. Few, I
hope, are capable of feeling what now passed in the mind of Blifil;
but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to
raise any objection to this visit. Fortune, however, or the gentleman
lately mentioned above, stood his friend, and prevented his undergoing
so great a shock; for at the very instant when the coach was sent for,
Partridge arrived, and, having called Mrs Miller from the company,
acquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light; and
hearing Mr Allworthy's intention, begged her to find some means of
stopping him: "For," says he, "the matter must at all hazards be kept
a secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find Mr Jones and
his mother, who arrived just as I left him, lamenting over one another
the horrid crime they have ignorantly committed."

The poor woman, who was almost deprived of her senses at his dreadful
news, was never less capable of invention than at present. However, as
women are much readier at this than men, she bethought herself of an
excuse, and, returning to Allworthy, said, "I am sure, sir, you will
be surprized at hearing any objection from me to the kind proposal you
just now made; and yet I am afraid of the consequence of it, if
carried immediately into execution. You must imagine, sir, that all
the calamities which have lately befallen this poor young fellow must
have thrown him into the lowest dejection of spirits; and now, sir,
should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy, as
I know your presence will occasion, it may, I am afraid, produce some
fatal mischief, especially as his servant, who is without, tells me he
is very far from being well."

"Is his servant without?" cries Allworthy; "pray call him hither. I
will ask him some questions concerning his master."

Partridge was at first afraid to appear before Mr Allworthy; but was
at length persuaded, after Mrs Miller, who had often heard his whole
story from his own mouth, had promised to introduce him.

Allworthy recollected Partridge the moment he came into the room,
though many years had passed since he had seen him. Mrs Miller,
therefore, might have spared here a formal oration, in which, indeed,
she was something prolix; for the reader, I believe, may have observed
already that the good woman, among other things, had a tongue always
ready for the service of her friends.

"And are you," said Allworthy to Partridge, "the servant of Mr Jones?"
"I can't say, sir," answered he, "that I am regularly a servant, but I
live with him, an't please your honour, at present. _Non sum qualis
eram_, as your honour very well knows."

Mr Allworthy then asked him many questions concerning Jones, as to his
health, and other matters; to all which Partridge answered, without
having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would
have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the
articles of this honest fellow's morality or his religion.

During this dialogue Mr Nightingale took his leave, and presently
after Mrs Miller left the room, when Allworthy likewise despatched
Blifil; for he imagined that Partridge when alone with him would be
more explicit than before company. They were no sooner left in private
together than Allworthy began, as in the following chapter.



Chapter vi.

In which the history is farther continued


"Sure, friend," said the good man, "you are the strangest of all human
beings. Not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately
persisting in a falshood, but to persist in it thus to the last, and
to pass thus upon the world for a servant of your own son! What
interest can you have in all this? What can be your motive?"

"I see, sir," said Partridge, falling down upon his knees, "that your
honour is prepossessed against me, and resolved not to believe
anything I say, and, therefore, what signifies my protestations? but
yet there is one above who knows that I am not the father of this
young man."

"How!" said Allworthy, "will you yet deny what you was formerly
convicted of upon such unanswerable, such manifest evidence? Nay, what
a confirmation is your being now found with this very man, of all
which twenty years ago appeared against you! I thought you had left
the country! nay, I thought you had been long since dead.--In what
manner did you know anything of this young man? Where did you meet
with him, unless you had kept some correspondence together? Do not
deny this; for I promise you it will greatly raise your son in my
opinion, to find that he hath such a sense of filial duty as privately
to support his father for so many years."

"If your honour will have patience to hear me," said Partridge, "I
will tell you all."--Being bid go on, he proceeded thus: "When your
honour conceived that displeasure against me, it ended in my ruin soon
after; for I lost my little school; and the minister, thinking I
suppose it would be agreeable to your honour, turned me out from the
office of clerk; so that I had nothing to trust to but the barber's
shop, which, in a country place like that, is a poor livelihood; and
when my wife died (for till that time I received a pension of £12 a
year from an unknown hand, which indeed I believe was your honour's
own, for nobody that ever I heard of doth these things besides)--but,
as I was saying, when she died, this pension forsook me; so that now,
as I owed two or three small debts, which began to be troublesome to
me, particularly one[*] which an attorney brought up by law-charges
from 15s. to near £30, and as I found all my usual means of living had
forsook me, I packed up my little all as well as I could, and went
off.

  [*] This is a fact which I knew happen to a poor clergyman in
  Dorsetshire, by the villany of an attorney who, not contented with
  the exorbitant costs to which the poor man was put by a single
  action, brought afterwards another action on the judgment, as it was
  called. A method frequently used to oppress the poor, and bring
  money into the pockets of attorneys, to the great scandal of the
  law, of the nation, of Christianity, and even of human nature
  itself.

"The first place I came to was Salisbury, where I got into the service
of a gentleman belonging to the law, and one of the best gentlemen
that ever I knew, for he was not only good to me, but I know a
thousand good and charitable acts which he did while I staid with him;
and I have known him often refuse business because it was paultry and
oppressive." "You need not be so particular," said Allworthy; "I know
this gentleman, and a very worthy man he is, and an honour to his
profession."--"Well, sir," continued Partridge, "from hence I removed
to Lymington, where I was above three years in the service of another
lawyer, who was likewise a very good sort of a man, and to be sure one
of the merriest gentlemen in England. Well, sir, at the end of the
three years I set up a little school, and was likely to do well again,
had it not been for a most unlucky accident. Here I kept a pig; and
one day, as ill fortune would have it, this pig broke out, and did a
trespass, I think they call it, in a garden belonging to one of my
neighbours, who was a proud, revengeful man, and employed a lawyer,
one--one--I can't think of his name; but he sent for a writ against
me, and had me to size. When I came there, Lord have mercy upon me--to
hear what the counsellors said! There was one that told my lord a
parcel of the confoundedest lies about me; he said that I used to
drive my hogs into other folk's gardens, and a great deal more; and at
last he said, he hoped I had at last brought my hogs to a fair market.
To be sure, one would have thought that, instead of being owner only
of one poor little pig, I had been the greatest hog-merchant in
England. Well--" "Pray," said Allworthy, "do not be so particular, I
have heard nothing of your son yet." "O it was a great many years,"
answered Partridge, "before I saw my son, as you are pleased to call
him.----I went over to Ireland after this, and taught school at Cork
(for that one suit ruined me again, and I lay seven years in
Winchester jail)."--"Well," said Allworthy, "pass that over till your
return to England."--"Then, sir," said he, "it was about half a year
ago that I landed at Bristol, where I staid some time, and not finding
it do there, and hearing of a place between that and Gloucester where
the barber was just dead, I went thither, and there I had been about
two months when Mr Jones came thither." He then gave Allworthy a very
particular account of their first meeting, and of everything, as well
as he could remember, which had happened from that day to this;
frequently interlarding his story with panegyrics on Jones, and not
forgetting to insinuate the great love and respect which he had for
Allworthy. He concluded with saying, "Now, sir, I have told your
honour the whole truth." And then repeated a most solemn protestation,
"That he was no more the father of Jones than of the Pope of Rome;"
and imprecated the most bitter curses on his head, if he did not speak
truth.

"What am I to think of this matter?" cries Allworthy. "For what
purpose should you so strongly deny a fact which I think it would be
rather your interest to own?" "Nay, sir," answered Partridge (for he
could hold no longer), "if your honour will not believe me, you are
like soon to have satisfaction enough. I wish you had mistaken the
mother of this young man, as well as you have his father."--And now
being asked what he meant, with all the symptoms of horror, both in
his voice and countenance, he told Allworthy the whole story, which he
had a little before expressed such desire to Mrs Miller to conceal
from him.

Allworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as Partridge
himself had been while he related it. "Good heavens!" says he, "in
what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men! How much
beyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carried!"
He had scarce uttered these words, when Mrs Waters came hastily and
abruptly into the room. Partridge no sooner saw her than he cried,
"Here, sir, here is the very woman herself. This is the unfortunate
mother of Mr Jones. I am sure she will acquit me before your honour.
Pray, madam----"

Mrs Waters, without paying any regard to what Partridge said, and
almost without taking any notice of him, advanced to Mr Allworthy. "I
believe, sir, it is so long since I had the honour of seeing you, that
you do not recollect me." "Indeed," answered Allworthy, "you are so
very much altered, on many accounts, that had not this man already
acquainted me who you are, I should not have immediately called you to
my remembrance. Have you, madam, any particular business which brings
you to me?" Allworthy spoke this with great reserve; for the reader
may easily believe he was not well pleased with the conduct of this
lady; neither with what he had formerly heard, nor with what Partridge
had now delivered.

Mrs Waters answered--"Indeed, sir, I have very particular business
with you; and it is such as I can impart only to yourself. I must
desire, therefore, the favour of a word with you alone: for I assure
you what I have to tell you is of the utmost importance."

Partridge was then ordered to withdraw, but before he went, he begged
the lady to satisfy Mr Allworthy that he was perfectly innocent. To
which she answered, "You need be under no apprehension, sir; I shall
satisfy Mr Allworthy very perfectly of that matter."

Then Partridge withdrew, and that past between Mr Allworthy and Mrs
Waters which is written in the next chapter.



Chapter vii.

Continuation of the history.


Mrs Waters remaining a few moments silent, Mr Allworthy could not
refrain from saying, "I am sorry, madam, to perceive, by what I have
since heard, that you have made so very ill a use----" "Mr Allworthy,"
says she, interrupting him, "I know I have faults, but ingratitude to
you is not one of them. I never can nor shall forget your goodness,
which I own I have very little deserved; but be pleased to wave all
upbraiding me at present, as I have so important an affair to
communicate to you concerning this young man, to whom you have given
my maiden name of Jones."

"Have I then," said Allworthy, "ignorantly punished an innocent man,
in the person of him who hath just left us? Was he not the father of
the child?" "Indeed he was not," said Mrs Waters. "You may be pleased
to remember, sir, I formerly told you, you should one day know; and I
acknowledge myself to have been guilty of a cruel neglect, in not
having discovered it to you before. Indeed, I little knew how
necessary it was." "Well, madam," said Allworthy, "be pleased to
proceed." "You must remember, sir," said she, "a young fellow, whose
name was Summer." "Very well," cries Allworthy, "he was the son of a
clergyman of great learning and virtue, for whom I had the highest
friendship." "So it appeared, sir," answered she; "for I believe you
bred the young man up, and maintained him at the university; where, I
think, he had finished his studies, when he came to reside at your
house; a finer man, I must say, the sun never shone upon; for, besides
the handsomest person I ever saw, he was so genteel, and had so much
wit and good breeding." "Poor gentleman," said Allworthy, "he was
indeed untimely snatched away; and little did I think he had any sins
of this kind to answer for; for I plainly perceive you are going to
tell me he was the father of your child."

"Indeed, sir," answered she, "he was not." "How!" said Allworthy, "to
what then tends all this preface?" "To a story," said she, "which I am
concerned falls to my lot to unfold to you. O, sir! prepare to hear
something which will surprize you, will grieve you." "Speak," said
Allworthy, "I am conscious of no crime, and cannot be afraid to hear."
"Sir," said she, "that Mr Summer, the son of your friend, educated at
your expense, who, after living a year in the house as if he had been
your own son, died there of the small-pox, was tenderly lamented by
you, and buried as if he had been your own; that Summer, sir, was the
father of this child." "How!" said Allworthy; "you contradict
yourself." "That I do not," answered she; "he was indeed the father of
this child, but not by me." "Take care, madam," said Allworthy, "do
not, to shun the imputation of any crime, be guilty of falshood.
Remember there is One from whom you can conceal nothing, and before
whose tribunal falshood will only aggravate your guilt." "Indeed,
sir," says she, "I am not his mother; nor would I now think myself so
for the world." "I know your reason," said Allworthy, "and shall
rejoice as much as you to find it otherwise; yet you must remember,
you yourself confest it before me." "So far what I confest," said she,
"was true, that these hands conveyed the infant to your bed; conveyed
it thither at the command of its mother; at her commands I afterwards
owned it, and thought myself, by her generosity, nobly rewarded, both
for my secrecy and my shame." "Who could this woman be?" said
Allworthy. "Indeed, I tremble to name her," answered Mrs Waters. "By
all this preparation I am to guess that she was a relation of mine,"
cried he. "Indeed she was a near one." At which words Allworthy
started, and she continued--"You had a sister, sir." "A sister!"
repeated he, looking aghast.--"As there is truth in heaven," cries
she, "your sister was the mother of that child you found between your
sheets." "Can it be possible?" cries he, "Good heavens!" "Have
patience, sir," said Mrs Waters, "and I will unfold to you the whole
story. Just after your departure for London, Miss Bridget came one day
to the house of my mother. She was pleased to say she had heard an
extraordinary character of me, for my learning and superior
understanding to all the young women there, so she was pleased to say.
She then bid me come to her to the great house; where, when I
attended, she employed me to read to her. She expressed great
satisfaction in my reading, shewed great kindness to me, and made me
many presents. At last she began to catechise me on the subject of
secrecy, to which I gave her such satisfactory answers, that, at last,
having locked the door of her room, she took me into her closet, and
then locking that door likewise, she said she should convince me of
the vast reliance she had on my integrity, by communicating a secret
in which her honour, and consequently her life, was concerned. She
then stopt, and after a silence of a few minutes, during which she
often wiped her eyes, she enquired of me if I thought my mother might
safely be confided in. I answered, I would stake my life on her
fidelity. She then imparted to me the great secret which laboured in
her breast, and which, I believe, was delivered with more pains than
she afterwards suffered in child-birth. It was then contrived that my
mother and myself only should attend at the time, and that Mrs Wilkins
should be sent out of the way, as she accordingly was, to the very
furthest part of Dorsetshire, to enquire the character of a servant;
for the lady had turned away her own maid near three months before;
during all which time I officiated about her person upon trial, as she
said, though, as she afterwards declared, I was not sufficiently handy
for the place. This, and many other such things which she used to say
of me, were all thrown out to prevent any suspicion which Wilkins
might hereafter have, when I was to own the child; for she thought it
could never be believed she would venture to hurt a young woman with
whom she had intrusted such a secret. You may be assured, sir, I was
well paid for all these affronts, which, together with being informed
with the occasion of them, very well contented me. Indeed, the lady
had a greater suspicion of Mrs Wilkins than of any other person; not
that she had the least aversion to the gentlewoman, but she thought
her incapable of keeping a secret, especially from you, sir; for I
have often heard Miss Bridget say, that, if Mrs Wilkins had committed
a murder, she believed she would acquaint you with it. At last the
expected day came, and Mrs Wilkins, who had been kept a week in
readiness, and put off from time to time, upon some pretence or other,
that she might not return too soon, was dispatched. Then the child was
born, in the presence only of myself and my mother, and was by my
mother conveyed to her own house, where it was privately kept by her
till the evening of your return, when I, by the command of Miss
Bridget, conveyed it into the bed where you found it. And all
suspicions were afterwards laid asleep by the artful conduct of your
sister, in pretending ill-will to the boy, and that any regard she
shewed him was out of meer complacence to you."

Mrs Waters then made many protestations of the truth of this story,
and concluded by saying, "Thus, sir, you have at last discovered your
nephew; for so I am sure you will hereafter think him, and I question
not but he will be both an honour and a comfort to you under that
appellation."

"I need not, madam," said Allworthy, "express my astonishment at what
you have told me; and yet surely you would not, and could not, have
put together so many circumstances to evidence an untruth. I confess I
recollect some passages relating to that Summer, which formerly gave
me a conceit that my sister had some liking to him. I mentioned it to
her; for I had such a regard to the young man, as well on his own
account as on his father's, that I should willingly have consented to
a match between them; but she exprest the highest disdain of my unkind
suspicion, as she called it; so that I never spoke more on the
subject. Good heavens! Well! the Lord disposeth all things.--Yet sure
it was a most unjustifiable conduct in my sister to carry this secret
with her out of the world." "I promise you, sir," said Mrs Waters,
"she always profest a contrary intention, and frequently told me she
intended one day to communicate it to you. She said, indeed, she was
highly rejoiced that her plot had succeeded so well, and that you had
of your own accord taken such a fancy to the child, that it was yet
unnecessary to make any express declaration. Oh! sir, had that lady
lived to have seen this poor young man turned like a vagabond from
your house: nay, sir, could she have lived to hear that you had
yourself employed a lawyer to prosecute him for a murder of which he
was not guilty----Forgive me, Mr Allworthy, I must say it was
unkind.--Indeed, you have been abused, he never deserved it of you."
"Indeed, madam," said Allworthy, "I have been abused by the person,
whoever he was, that told you so." "Nay, sir," said she, "I would not
be mistaken, I did not presume to say you were guilty of any wrong.
The gentleman who came to me proposed no such matter; he only said,
taking me for Mr Fitzpatrick's wife, that, if Mr Jones had murdered my
husband, I should be assisted with any money I wanted to carry on the
prosecution, by a very worthy gentleman, who, he said, was well
apprized what a villain I had to deal with. It was by this man I found
out who Mr Jones was; and this man, whose name is Dowling, Mr Jones
tells me is your steward. I discovered his name by a very odd
accident; for he himself refused to tell it me; but Partridge, who met
him at my lodgings the second time he came, knew him formerly at
Salisbury."

"And did this Mr Dowling," says Allworthy, with great astonishment
in his countenance, "tell you that I would assist in the
prosecution?"--"No, sir," answered she, "I will not charge him
wrongfully. He said I should be assisted, but he mentioned no name.
Yet you must pardon me, sir, if from circumstances I thought it could
be no other."--"Indeed, madam," says Allworthy, "from circumstances I
am too well convinced it was another. Good Heaven! by what wonderful
means is the blackest and deepest villany sometimes discovered!--Shall
I beg you, madam, to stay till the person you have mentioned comes,
for I expect him every minute? nay, he may be, perhaps, already in the
house."

Allworthy then stept to the door, in order to call a servant, when in
came, not Mr Dowling, but the gentleman who will be seen in the next
chapter.



Chapter viii.

Further continuation.


The gentleman who now arrived was no other than Mr Western. He no
sooner saw Allworthy, than, without considering in the least the
presence of Mrs Waters, he began to vociferate in the following
manner: "Fine doings at my house! A rare kettle of fish I have
discovered at last! who the devil would be plagued with a daughter?"
"What's the matter, neighbour?" said Allworthy. "Matter enough,"
answered Western: "when I thought she was just a coming to; nay, when
she had in a manner promised me to do as I would ha her, and when I
was a hoped to have had nothing more to do than to have sent for the
lawyer, and finished all; what do you think I have found out? that the
little b-- hath bin playing tricks with me all the while, and carrying
on a correspondence with that bastard of yours. Sister Western, whom I
have quarrelled with upon her account, sent me word o't, and I ordered
her pockets to be searched when she was asleep, and here I have got un
signed with the son of a whore's own name. I have not had patience to
read half o't, for 'tis longer than one of parson Supple's sermons;
but I find plainly it is all about love; and indeed what should it be
else? I have packed her up in chamber again, and to-morrow morning
down she goes into the country, unless she consents to be married
directly, and there she shall live in a garret upon bread and water
all her days; and the sooner such a b-- breaks her heart the better,
though, d--n her, that I believe is too tough. She will live long
enough to plague me." "Mr Western," answered Allworthy, "you know I
have always protested against force, and you yourself consented that
none should be used." "Ay," cries he, "that was only upon condition
that she would consent without. What the devil and doctor Faustus!
shan't I do what I will with my own daughter, especially when I desire
nothing but her own good?" "Well, neighbour," answered Allworthy, "if
you will give me leave, I will undertake once to argue with the young
lady." "Will you?" said Western; "why that is kind now, and
neighbourly, and mayhap you will do more than I have been able to do
with her; for I promise you she hath a very good opinion of you."
"Well, sir," said Allworthy, "if you will go home, and release the
young lady from her captivity, I will wait upon her within this
half-hour." "But suppose," said Western, "she should run away with un
in the meantime? For lawyer Dowling tells me there is no hopes of
hanging the fellow at last; for that the man is alive, and like to do
well, and that he thinks Jones will be out of prison again presently."
"How!" said Allworthy; "what, did you employ him then to enquire or to
do anything in that matter?" "Not I," answered Western, "he mentioned
it to me just now of his own accord." "Just now!" cries Allworthy,
"why, where did you see him then? I want much to see Mr Dowling."
"Why, you may see un an you will presently at my lodgings; for there
is to be a meeting of lawyers there this morning about a mortgage.
'Icod! I shall lose two or dree thousand pounds, I believe, by that
honest gentleman, Mr Nightingale." "Well, sir," said Allworthy, "I
will be with you within the half-hour." "And do for once," cries the
squire, "take a fool's advice; never think of dealing with her by
gentle methods, take my word for it those will never do. I have tried
'um long enough. She must be frightened into it, there is no other
way. Tell her I'm her father; and of the horrid sin of disobedience,
and of the dreadful punishment of it in t'other world, and then tell
her about being locked up all her life in a garret in this, and being
kept only on bread and water." "I will do all I can," said Allworthy;
"for I promise you there is nothing I wish for more than an alliance
with this amiable creature." "Nay, the girl is well enough for matter
o' that," cries the squire; "a man may go farther and meet with worse
meat; that I may declare o'her, thof she be my own daughter. And if
she will but be obedient to me, there is narrow a father within a
hundred miles o' the place, that loves a daughter better than I do;
but I see you are busy with the lady here, so I will go huome and
expect you; and so your humble servant."

As soon as Mr Western was gone Mrs Waters said, "I see, sir, the
squire hath not the least remembrance of my face. I believe, Mr
Allworthy, you would not have known me neither. I am very considerably
altered since that day when you so kindly gave me that advice, which I
had been happy had I followed." "Indeed, madam," cries Allworthy, "it
gave me great concern when I first heard the contrary." "Indeed, sir,"
says she, "I was ruined by a very deep scheme of villany, which if you
knew, though I pretend not to think it would justify me in your
opinion, it would at least mitigate my offence, and induce you to pity
me: you are not now at leisure to hear my whole story; but this I
assure you, I was betrayed by the most solemn promises of marriage;
nay, in the eye of heaven I was married to him; for, after much
reading on the subject, I am convinced that particular ceremonies are
only requisite to give a legal sanction to marriage, and have only a
worldly use in giving a woman the privileges of a wife; but that she
who lives constant to one man, after a solemn private affiance,
whatever the world may call her, hath little to charge on her own
conscience." "I am sorry, madam," said Allworthy, "you made so ill a
use of your learning. Indeed, it would have been well that you had
been possessed of much more, or had remained in a state of ignorance.
And yet, madam, I am afraid you have more than this sin to answer
for." "During his life," answered she, "which was above a dozen years,
I most solemnly assure you I had not. And consider, sir, on my behalf,
what is in the power of a woman stript of her reputation and left
destitute; whether the good-natured world will suffer such a stray
sheep to return to the road of virtue, even if she was never so
desirous. I protest, then, I would have chose it had it been in my
power; but necessity drove me into the arms of Captain Waters, with
whom, though still unmarried, I lived as a wife for many years, and
went by his name. I parted with this gentleman at Worcester, on his
march against the rebels, and it was then I accidentally met with Mr
Jones, who rescued me from the hands of a villain. Indeed, he is the
worthiest of men. No young gentleman of his age is, I believe, freer
from vice, and few have the twentieth part of his virtues; nay,
whatever vices he hath had, I am firmly persuaded he hath now taken a
resolution to abandon them." "I hope he hath," cries Allworthy, "and I
hope he will preserve that resolution. I must say, I have still the
same hopes with regard to yourself. The world, I do agree, are apt to
be too unmerciful on these occasions; yet time and perseverance will
get the better of this their disinclination, as I may call it, to
pity; for though they are not, like heaven, ready to receive a
penitent sinner; yet a continued repentance will at length obtain
mercy even with the world. This you may be assured of, Mrs Waters,
that whenever I find you are sincere in such good intentions, you
shall want no assistance in my power to make them effectual."

Mrs Waters fell now upon her knees before him, and, in a flood of
tears, made him many most passionate acknowledgments of his goodness,
which, as she truly said, savoured more of the divine than human
nature.

Allworthy raised her up, and spoke in the most tender manner, making
use of every expression which his invention could suggest to comfort
her, when he was interrupted by the arrival of Mr Dowling, who, upon
his first entrance, seeing Mrs Waters, started, and appeared in some
confusion; from which he soon recovered himself as well as he could,
and then said he was in the utmost haste to attend counsel at Mr
Western's lodgings; but, however, thought it his duty to call and
acquaint him with the opinion of counsel upon the case which he had
before told him, which was that the conversion of the moneys in that
case could not be questioned in a criminal cause, but that an action
of trover might be brought, and if it appeared to the jury to be the
moneys of plaintiff, that plaintiff would recover a verdict for the
value.

Allworthy, without making any answer to this, bolted the door, and
then, advancing with a stern look to Dowling, he said, "Whatever be
your haste, sir, I must first receive an answer to some questions. Do
you know this lady?"--"That lady, sir!" answered Dowling, with great
hesitation. Allworthy then, with the most solemn voice, said, "Look
you, Mr Dowling, as you value my favour, or your continuance a moment
longer in my service, do not hesitate nor prevaricate; but answer
faithfully and truly to every question I ask.----Do you know this
lady?"--"Yes, sir," said Dowling, "I have seen the lady." "Where,
sir?" "At her own lodgings."--"Upon what business did you go thither,
sir; and who sent you?" "I went, sir, to enquire, sir, about Mr
Jones." "And who sent you to enquire about him?" "Who, sir? why, sir,
Mr Blifil sent me." "And what did you say to the lady concerning that
matter?" "Nay, sir, it is impossible to recollect every word." "Will
you please, madam, to assist the gentleman's memory?" "He told me,
sir," said Mrs Waters, "that if Mr Jones had murdered my husband, I
should be assisted by any money I wanted to carry on the prosecution,
by a very worthy gentleman, who was well apprized what a villain I had
to deal with. These, I can safely swear, were the very words he
spoke."--"Were these the words, sir?" said Allworthy. "I cannot charge
my memory exactly," cries Dowling, "but I believe I did speak to that
purpose."--"And did Mr Blifil order you to say so?" "I am sure, sir, I
should not have gone on my own accord, nor have willingly exceeded my
authority in matters of this kind. If I said so, I must have so
understood Mr Blifil's instructions." "Look you, Mr Dowling," said
Allworthy; "I promise you before this lady, that whatever you have
done in this affair by Mr Blifil's order I will forgive, provided you
now tell me strictly the truth; for I believe what you say, that you
would not have acted of your own accord and without authority in this
matter.----Mr Blifil then likewise sent you to examine the two fellows
at Aldersgate?"--"He did, sir." "Well, and what instructions did he
then give you? Recollect as well as you can, and tell me, as near as
possible, the very words he used."--"Why, sir, Mr Blifil sent me to
find out the persons who were eye-witnesses of this fight. He said, he
feared they might be tampered with by Mr Jones, or some of his
friends. He said, blood required blood; and that not only all who
concealed a murderer, but those who omitted anything in their power to
bring him to justice, were sharers in his guilt. He said, he found you
was very desirous of having the villain brought to justice, though it
was not proper you should appear in it." "He did so?" says
Allworthy.--"Yes, sir," cries Dowling; "I should not, I am sure, have
proceeded such lengths for the sake of any other person living but
your worship."--"What lengths, sir?" said Allworthy.--"Nay, sir,"
cries Dowling, "I would not have your worship think I would, on any
account, be guilty of subornation of perjury; but there are two ways
of delivering evidence. I told them, therefore, that if any offers
should be made them on the other side, they should refuse them, and
that they might be assured they should lose nothing by being honest
men, and telling the truth. I said, we were told that Mr Jones had
assaulted the gentleman first, and that, if that was the truth, they
should declare it; and I did give them some hints that they should be
no losers."--"I think you went lengths indeed," cries
Allworthy.--"Nay, sir," answered Dowling, "I am sure I did not desire
them to tell an untruth;----nor should I have said what I did, unless
it had been to oblige you."--"You would not have thought, I believe,"
says Allworthy, "to have obliged me, had you known that this Mr Jones
was my own nephew."--"I am sure, sir," answered he, "it did not become
me to take any notice of what I thought you desired to
conceal."--"How!" cries Allworthy, "and did you know it then?"--"Nay,
sir," answered Dowling, "if your worship bids me speak the truth, I am
sure I shall do it.--Indeed, sir, I did know it; for they were almost
the last words which Madam Blifil ever spoke, which she mentioned to
me as I stood alone by her bedside, when she delivered me the letter I
brought your worship from her."--"What letter?" cries Allworthy.--"The
letter, sir," answered Dowling, "which I brought from Salisbury, and
which I delivered into the hands of Mr Blifil."--"O heavens!" cries
Allworthy: "Well, and what were the words? What did my sister say to
you?"--"She took me by the hand," answered he, "and, as she delivered
me the letter, said, `I scarce know what I have written. Tell my
brother, Mr Jones is his nephew--He is my son.--Bless him,' says she,
and then fell backward, as if dying away. I presently called in the
people, and she never spoke more to me, and died within a few minutes
afterwards."--Allworthy stood a minute silent, lifting up his eyes;
and then, turning to Dowling, said, "How came you, sir, not to deliver
me this message?" "Your worship," answered he, "must remember that you
was at that time ill in bed; and, being in a violent hurry, as indeed
I always am, I delivered the letter and message to Mr Blifil, who told
me he would carry them both to you, which he hath since told me he
did, and that your worship, partly out of friendship to Mr Jones, and
partly out of regard to your sister, would never have it mentioned,
and did intend to conceal it from the world; and therefore, sir, if
you had not mentioned it to me first, I am certain I should never have
thought it belonged to me to say anything of the matter, either to
your worship or any other person."

We have remarked somewhere already, that it is possible for a man to
convey a lie in the words of truth; this was the case at present; for
Blifil had, in fact, told Dowling what he now related, but had not
imposed upon him, nor indeed had imagined he was able so to do. In
reality, the promises which Blifil had made to Dowling were the
motives which had induced him to secrecy; and, as he now very plainly
saw Blifil would not be able to keep them, he thought proper now to
make this confession, which the promises of forgiveness, joined to the
threats, the voice, the looks of Allworthy, and the discoveries he had
made before, extorted from him, who was besides taken unawares, and
had no time to consider of evasions.

Allworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation, and, having
enjoined on Dowling strict silence as to what had past, conducted that
gentleman himself to the door, lest he should see Blifil, who was
returned to his chamber, where he exulted in the thoughts of his last
deceit on his uncle, and little suspected what had since passed
below-stairs.

As Allworthy was returning to his room he met Mrs Miller in the entry,
who, with a face all pale and full of terror, said to him, "O! sir, I
find this wicked woman hath been with you, and you know all; yet do
not on this account abandon the poor young man. Consider, sir, he was
ignorant it was his own mother; and the discovery itself will most
probably break his heart, without your unkindness."

"Madam," says Allworthy, "I am under such an astonishment at what I
have heard, that I am really unable to satisfy you; but come with me
into my room. Indeed, Mrs Miller, I have made surprizing discoveries,
and you shall soon know them."

The poor woman followed him trembling; and now Allworthy, going up to
Mrs Waters, took her by the hand, and then, turning to Mrs Miller,
said, "What reward shall I bestow upon this gentlewoman, for the
services she hath done me?--O! Mrs Miller, you have a thousand times
heard me call the young man to whom you are so faithful a friend, my
son. Little did I then think he was indeed related to me at all.--Your
friend, madam, is my nephew; he is the brother of that wicked viper
which I have so long nourished in my bosom.--She will herself tell you
the whole story, and how the youth came to pass for her son. Indeed,
Mrs Miller, I am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that I have
been abused; abused by one whom you too justly suspected of being a
villain. He is, in truth, the worst of villains."

The joy which Mrs Miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech,
and might perhaps have deprived her of her senses, if not of life, had
not a friendly shower of tears come seasonably to her relief. At
length, recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak,
she cried, "And is my dear Mr Jones then your nephew, sir, and not the
son of this lady? And are your eyes opened to him at last? And shall I
live to see him as happy as he deserves?" "He certainly is my nephew,"
says Allworthy, "and I hope all the rest."--"And is this the dear good
woman, the person," cries she, "to whom all this discovery is
owing?"--"She is indeed," says Allworthy.--"Why, then," cried Mrs
Miller, upon her knees, "may Heaven shower down its choicest blessings
upon her head, and for this one good action forgive her all her sins,
be they never so many!"

Mrs Waters then informed them that she believed Jones would very
shortly be released; for that the surgeon was gone, in company with a
nobleman, to the justice who committed him, in order to certify that
Mr Fitzpatrick was out of all manner of danger, and to procure his
prisoner his liberty.

Allworthy said he should be glad to find his nephew there at his
return home; but that he was then obliged to go on some business of
consequence. He then called to a servant to fetch him a chair, and
presently left the two ladies together.

Mr Blifil, hearing the chair ordered, came downstairs to attend upon
his uncle; for he never was deficient in such acts of duty. He asked
his uncle if he was going out, which is a civil way of asking a man
whither he is going: to which the other making no answer, he again
desired to know when he would be pleased to return?--Allworthy made no
answer to this neither, till he was just going into his chair, and
then, turning about, he said--"Harkee, sir, do you find out, before my
return, the letter which your mother sent me on her death-bed."
Allworthy then departed, and left Blifil in a situation to be envied
only by a man who is just going to be hanged.



Chapter ix.

A further continuation.


Allworthy took an opportunity, whilst he was in the chair, of reading
the letter from Jones to Sophia, which Western delivered him; and
there were some expressions in it concerning himself which drew tears
from his eyes. At length he arrived at Mr Western's, and was
introduced to Sophia.

When the first ceremonies were past, and the gentleman and lady had
taken their chairs, a silence of some minutes ensued; during which the
latter, who had been prepared for the visit by her father, sat playing
with her fan, and had every mark of confusion both in her countenance
and behaviour. At length Allworthy, who was himself a little
disconcerted, began thus: "I am afraid, Miss Western, my family hath
been the occasion of giving you some uneasiness; to which, I fear, I
have innocently become more instrumental than I intended. Be assured,
madam, had I at first known how disagreeable the proposals had been, I
should not have suffered you to have been so long persecuted. I hope,
therefore, you will not think the design of this visit is to trouble
you with any further solicitations of that kind, but entirely to
relieve you from them."

"Sir," said Sophia, with a little modest hesitation, "this behaviour
is most kind and generous, and such as I could expect only from Mr
Allworthy; but as you have been so kind to mention this matter, you
will pardon me for saying it hath, indeed, given me great uneasiness,
and hath been the occasion of my suffering much cruel treatment from
a father who was, till that unhappy affair, the tenderest and fondest
of all parents. I am convinced, sir, you are too good and generous to
resent my refusal of your nephew. Our inclinations are not in our own
power; and whatever may be his merit, I cannot force them in his
favour." "I assure you, most amiable young lady," said Allworthy, "I
am capable of no such resentment, had the person been my own son, and
had I entertained the highest esteem for him. For you say truly,
madam, we cannot force our inclinations, much less can they be
directed by another." "Oh! sir," answered Sophia, "every word you
speak proves you deserve that good, that great, that benevolent
character the whole world allows you. I assure you, sir, nothing less
than the certain prospect of future misery could have made me resist
the commands of my father." "I sincerely believe you, madam," replied
Allworthy, "and I heartily congratulate you on your prudent
foresight, since by so justifiable a resistance you have avoided
misery indeed!" "You speak now, Mr Allworthy," cries she, "with a
delicacy which few men are capable of feeling! but surely, in my
opinion, to lead our lives with one to whom we are indifferent must
be a state of wretchedness.----Perhaps that wretchedness would be
even increased by a sense of the merits of an object to whom we
cannot give our affections. If I had married Mr Blifil--" "Pardon my
interrupting you, madam," answered Allworthy, "but I cannot bear the
supposition.--Believe me, Miss Western, I rejoice from my heart, I
rejoice in your escape.--I have discovered the wretch for whom you
have suffered all this cruel violence from your father to be a
villain." "How, sir!" cries Sophia--"you must believe this surprizes
me."--"It hath surprized me, madam," answered Allworthy, "and so it
will the world.----But I have acquainted you with the real truth."
"Nothing but truth," says Sophia, "can, I am convinced, come from the
lips of Mr Allworthy.----Yet, sir, such sudden, such unexpected
news.----Discovered, you say----may villany be ever so!"--"You will
soon enough hear the story," cries Allworthy;--"at present let us not
mention so detested a name.--I have another matter of a very serious
nature to propose.--O! Miss Western, I know your vast worth, nor can
I so easily part with the ambition of being allied to it.--I have a
near relation, madam, a young man whose character is, I am convinced,
the very opposite to that of this wretch, and whose fortune I will
make equal to what his was to have been. Could I, madam, hope you
would admit a visit from him?" Sophia, after a minute's silence,
answered, "I will deal with the utmost sincerity with Mr Allworthy.
His character, and the obligation I have just received from him,
demand it. I have determined at present to listen to no such
proposals from any person. My only desire is to be restored to the
affection of my father, and to be again the mistress of his family.
This, sir, I hope to owe to your good offices. Let me beseech you,
let me conjure you, by all the goodness which I, and all who know
you, have experienced, do not, the very moment when you have released
me from one persecution, do not engage me in another as miserable and
as fruitless." "Indeed, Miss Western," replied Allworthy, "I am
capable of no such conduct; and if this be your resolution, he must
submit to the disappointment, whatever torments he may suffer under
it." "I must smile now, Mr Allworthy," answered Sophia, "when you
mention the torments of a man whom I do not know, and who can
consequently have so little acquaintance with me." "Pardon me, dear
young lady," cries Allworthy, "I begin now to be afraid he hath had
too much acquaintance for the repose of his future days; since, if
ever man was capable of a sincere, violent, and noble passion, such,
I am convinced, is my unhappy nephew's for Miss Western." "A nephew
of your's, Mr Allworthy!" answered Sophia. "It is surely strange. I
never heard of him before." "Indeed, madam," cries Allworthy, "it is
only the circumstance of his being my nephew to which you are a
stranger, and which, till this day, was a secret to me.--Mr Jones,
who has long loved you, he! he is my nephew!" "Mr Jones your nephew,
sir!" cries Sophia, "can it be possible?"--"He is, indeed, madam,"
answered Allworthy; "he is my own sister's son--as such I shall
always own him; nor am I ashamed of owning him. I am much more
ashamed of my past behaviour to him; but I was as ignorant of his
merit as of his birth. Indeed, Miss Western, I have used him
cruelly----Indeed I have."--Here the good man wiped his eyes, and
after a short pause proceeded--"I never shall be able to reward him
for his sufferings without your assistance.----Believe me, most
amiable young lady, I must have a great esteem of that offering which
I make to your worth. I know he hath been guilty of faults; but there
is great goodness of heart at the bottom. Believe me, madam, there
is." Here he stopped, seeming to expect an answer, which he presently
received from Sophia, after she had a little recovered herself from
the hurry of spirits into which so strange and sudden information had
thrown her: "I sincerely wish you joy, sir, of a discovery in which
you seem to have such satisfaction. I doubt not but you will have all
the comfort you can promise yourself from it. The young gentleman
hath certainly a thousand good qualities, which makes it impossible
he should not behave well to such an uncle."--"I hope, madam," said
Allworthy, "he hath those good qualities which must make him a good
husband.--He must, I am sure, be of all men the most abandoned, if a
lady of your merit should condescend--" "You must pardon me, Mr
Allworthy," answered Sophia; "I cannot listen to a proposal of this
kind. Mr Jones, I am convinced, hath much merit; but I shall never
receive Mr Jones as one who is to be my husband--Upon my honour I
never will."--"Pardon me, madam," cries Allworthy, "if I am a little
surprized, after what I have heard from Mr Western--I hope the
unhappy young man hath done nothing to forfeit your good opinion, if
he had ever the honour to enjoy it.--Perhaps, he may have been
misrepresented to you, as he was to me. The same villany may have
injured him everywhere.--He is no murderer, I assure you; as he hath
been called."--"Mr Allworthy," answered Sophia, "I have told you my
resolution. I wonder not at what my father hath told you; but,
whatever his apprehensions or fears have been, if I know my heart, I
have given no occasion for them; since it
