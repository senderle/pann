Chapter i.

_Containing the exordium, &c._


The various accidents which befel a very worthy couple after their
uniting in the state of matrimony will be the subject of the following
history. The distresses which they waded through were some of them so
exquisite, and the incidents which produced these so extraordinary,
that they seemed to require not only the utmost malice, but the utmost
invention, which superstition hath ever attributed to Fortune: though
whether any such being interfered in the case, or, indeed, whether
there be any such being in the universe, is a matter which I by no means
presume to determine in the affirmative. To speak a bold truth, I am,
after much mature deliberation, inclined to suspect that the public
voice hath, in all ages, done much injustice to Fortune, and hath
convicted her of many facts in which she had not the least concern.
I question much whether we may not, by natural means, account for the
success of knaves, the calamities of fools, with all the miseries
in which men of sense sometimes involve themselves, by quitting
the directions of Prudence, and following the blind guidance of a
predominant passion; in short, for all the ordinary phenomena which are
imputed to Fortune; whom, perhaps, men accuse with no less absurdity in
life, than a bad player complains of ill luck at the game of chess.

But if men are sometimes guilty of laying improper blame on this
imaginary being, they are altogether as apt to make her amends by
ascribing to her honours which she as little deserves. To retrieve the
ill consequences of a foolish conduct, and by struggling manfully with
distress to subdue it, is one of the noblest efforts of wisdom and
virtue. Whoever, therefore, calls such a man fortunate, is guilty of no
less impropriety in speech than he would be who should call the statuary
or the poet fortunate who carved a Venus or who writ an Iliad.

Life may as properly be called an art as any other; and the great
incidents in it are no more to be considered as mere accidents than the
several members of a fine statue or a noble poem. The critics in all
these are not content with seeing anything to be great without knowing
why and how it came to be so. By examining carefully the several
gradations which conduce to bring every model to perfection, we learn
truly to know that science in which the model is formed: as histories of
this kind, therefore, may properly be called models of _human life_,
so, by observing minutely the several incidents which tend to the
catastrophe or completion of the whole, and the minute causes whence
those incidents are produced, we shall best be instructed in this most
useful of all arts, which I call the _art_ of _life_.




Chapter ii

_The history sets out. Observations on the excellency of the English
constitution and curious examinations before a justice of peace._


On the first of April, in the year ----, the watchmen of a certain
parish (I know not particularly which) within the liberty of Westminster
brought several persons whom they had apprehended the preceding night
before Jonathan Thrasher, Esq., one of the justices of the peace for
that liberty.

But here, reader, before we proceed to the trials of these offenders,
we shall, after our usual manner, premise some things which it may be
necessary for thee to know.

It hath been observed, I think, by many, as well as the celebrated
writer of three letters, that no human institution is capable of
consummate perfection. An observation which, perhaps, that writer at
least gathered from discovering some defects in the polity even of this
well-regulated nation. And, indeed, if there should be any such defect
in a constitution which my Lord Coke long ago told us "the wisdom of
all the wise men in the world, if they had all met together at one time,
could not have equalled," which some of our wisest men who were met
together long before said was too good to be altered in any particular,
and which, nevertheless, hath been mending ever since, by a very great
number of the said wise men: if, I say, this constitution should
be imperfect, we may be allowed, I think, to doubt whether any such
faultless model can be found among the institutions of men.

It will probably be objected, that the small imperfections which I
am about to produce do not lie in the laws themselves, but in the ill
execution of them; but, with submission, this appears to me to be no
less an absurdity than to say of any machine that it is excellently
made, though incapable of performing its functions. Good laws should
execute themselves in a well-regulated state; at least, if the same
legislature which provides the laws doth not provide for the execution
of them, they act as Graham would do, if he should form all the parts of
a clock in the most exquisite manner, yet put them so together that the
clock could not go. In this case, surely, we might say that there was a
small defect in the constitution of the clock.

To say the truth, Graham would soon see the fault, and would easily
remedy it. The fault, indeed, could be no other than that the parts were
improperly disposed.

Perhaps, reader, I have another illustration which will set my intention
in still a clearer light before you. Figure to yourself then a family,
the master of which should dispose of the several economical offices in
the following manner; viz. should put his butler in the coach-box, his
steward behind his coach, his coachman in the butlery, and his footman
in the stewardship, and in the same ridiculous manner should misemploy
the talents of every other servant; it is easy to see what a figure such
a family must make in the world.

As ridiculous as this may seem, I have often considered some of the
lower officers in our civil government to be disposed in this very
manner. To begin, I think, as low as I well can, with the watchmen in
our metropolis, who, being to guard our streets by night from thieves
and robbers, an office which at least requires strength of body, are
chosen out of those poor old decrepit people who are, from their want
of bodily strength, rendered incapable of getting a livelihood by work.
These men, armed only with a pole, which some of them are scarce able
to lift, are to secure the persons and houses of his majesty's subjects
from the attacks of gangs of young, bold, stout, desperate, and
well-armed villains.

     Quae non viribus istis
     Munera conveniunt.

If the poor old fellows should run away from such enemies, no one I
think can wonder, unless it be that they were able to make their escape.

The higher we proceed among our public officers and magistrates, the
less defects of this kind will, perhaps, be observable. Mr. Thrasher,
however, the justice before whom the prisoners above mentioned were now
brought, had some few imperfections in his magistratical capacity.
I own, I have been sometimes inclined to think that this office of a
justice of peace requires some knowledge of the law: for this simple
reason; because, in every case which comes before him, he is to judge
and act according to law. Again, as these laws are contained in a great
variety of books, the statutes which relate to the office of a justice
of peace making of themselves at least two large volumes in folio; and
that part of his jurisdiction which is founded on the common law
being dispersed in above a hundred volumes, I cannot conceive how this
knowledge should by acquired without reading; and yet certain it is, Mr.
Thrasher never read one syllable of the matter.

This, perhaps, was a defect; but this was not all: for where mere
ignorance is to decide a point between two litigants, it will always be
an even chance whether it decides right or wrong: but sorry am I to
say, right was often in a much worse situation than this, and wrong hath
often had five hundred to one on his side before that magistrate; who,
if he was ignorant of the law of England, was yet well versed in the
laws of nature. He perfectly well understood that fundamental principle
so strongly laid down in the institutes of the learned Rochefoucault,
by which the duty of self-love is so strongly enforced, and every man is
taught to consider himself as the centre of gravity, and to attract
all things thither. To speak the truth plainly, the justice was never
indifferent in a cause but when he could get nothing on either side.

Such was the justice to whose tremendous bar Mr. Gotobed the constable,
on the day above mentioned, brought several delinquents, who, as we have
said, had been apprehended by the watch for diverse outrages.

The first who came upon his trial was as bloody a spectre as ever the
imagination of a murderer or a tragic poet conceived. This poor wretch
was charged with a battery by a much stouter man than himself; indeed
the accused person bore about him some evidence that he had been in an
affray, his cloaths being very bloody, but certain open sluices on his
own head sufficiently shewed whence all the scarlet stream had issued:
whereas the accuser had not the least mark or appearance of any wound.
The justice asked the defendant, What he meant by breaking the king's
peace?----To which he answered----"Upon my shoul I do love the king very
well, and I have not been after breaking anything of his that I do know;
but upon my shoul this man hath brake my head, and my head did brake his
stick; that is all, gra." He then offered to produce several witnesses
against this improbable accusation; but the justice presently
interrupted him, saying, "Sirrah, your tongue betrays your guilt. You
are an Irishman, and that is always sufficient evidence with me."

The second criminal was a poor woman, who was taken up by the watch as a
street-walker. It was alleged against her that she was found walking the
streets after twelve o'clock, and the watchman declared he believed her
to be a common strumpet. She pleaded in her defence (as was really the
truth) that she was a servant, and was sent by her mistress, who was a
little shopkeeper and upon the point of delivery, to fetch a midwife;
which she offered to prove by several of the neighbours, if she was
allowed to send for them. The justice asked her why she had not done
it before? to which she answered, she had no money, and could get no
messenger. The justice then called her several scurrilous names, and,
declaring she was guilty within the statute of street-walking, ordered
her to Bridewell for a month.

A genteel young man and woman were then set forward, and a very
grave-looking person swore he caught them in a situation which we cannot
as particularly describe here as he did before the magistrate; who,
having received a wink from his clerk, declared with much warmth that
the fact was incredible and impossible. He presently discharged the
accused parties, and was going, without any evidence, to commit the
accuser for perjury; but this the clerk dissuaded him from, saying he
doubted whether a justice of peace had any such power. The justice at
first differed in opinion, and said, "He had seen a man stand in the
pillory about perjury; nay, he had known a man in gaol for it too; and
how came he there if he was not committed thither?" "Why, that is true,
sir," answered the clerk; "and yet I have been told by a very great
lawyer that a man cannot be committed for perjury before he is indicted;
and the reason is, I believe, because it is not against the peace before
the indictment makes it so." "Why, that may be," cries the justice, "and
indeed perjury is but scandalous words, and I know a man cannot have
no warrant for those, unless you put for rioting [Footnote: _Opus est
interprete._ By the laws of England abusive words are not punishable
by the magistrate; some commissioners of the peace, therefore, when one
scold hath applied to them for a warrant against another, from a too
eager desire of doing justice, have construed a little harmless scolding
into a riot, which is in law an outrageous breach of the peace committed
by several persons, by three at the least, nor can a less number be
convicted of it. Under this word rioting, or riotting (for I have seen
it spelt both ways), many thousands of old women have been arrested and
put to expense, sometimes in prison, for a little intemperate use of
their tongues. This practice began to decrease in the year 1749.] them
into the warrant."

The witness was now about to be discharged, when the lady whom he had
accused declared she would swear the peace against him, for that he had
called her a whore several times. "Oho! you will swear the peace, madam,
will you?" cries the justice: "Give her the peace, presently; and pray,
Mr. Constable, secure the prisoner, now we have him, while a warrant is
made to take him up." All which was immediately performed, and the poor
witness, for want of securities, was sent to prison.

A young fellow, whose name was Booth, was now charged with beating the
watchman in the execution of his office and breaking his lanthorn. This
was deposed by two witnesses; and the shattered remains of a broken
lanthorn, which had been long preserved for the sake of its testimony,
were produced to corroborate the evidence. The justice, perceiving
the criminal to be but shabbily drest, was going to commit him without
asking any further questions. At length, however, at the earnest request
of the accused, the worthy magistrate submitted to hear his defence.
The young man then alledged, as was in reality the case, "That as he was
walking home to his lodging he saw two men in the street cruelly beating
a third, upon which he had stopt and endeavoured to assist the person
who was so unequally attacked; that the watch came up during the affray,
and took them all four into custody; that they were immediately carried
to the round-house, where the two original assailants, who appeared
to be men of fortune, found means to make up the matter, and were
discharged by the constable, a favour which he himself, having no money
in his pocket, was unable to obtain. He utterly denied having assaulted
any of the watchmen, and solemnly declared that he was offered his
liberty at the price of half a crown."

Though the bare word of an offender can never be taken against the oath
of his accuser, yet the matter of this defence was so pertinent,
and delivered with such an air of truth and sincerity, that, had
the magistrate been endued with much sagacity, or had he been very
moderately gifted with another quality very necessary to all who are
to administer justice, he would have employed some labour in
cross-examining the watchmen; at least he would have given the defendant
the time he desired to send for the other persons who were present at
the affray; neither of which he did. In short, the magistrate had too
great an honour for truth to suspect that she ever appeared in sordid
apparel; nor did he ever sully his sublime notions of that virtue by
uniting them with the mean ideas of poverty and distress.

There remained now only one prisoner, and that was the poor man himself
in whose defence the last-mentioned culprit was engaged. His trial
took but a very short time. A cause of battery and broken lanthorn was
instituted against him, and proved in the same manner; nor would
the justice hear one word in defence; but, though his patience was
exhausted, his breath was not; for against this last wretch he poured
forth a great many volleys of menaces and abuse.

The delinquents were then all dispatched to prison under a guard of
watchmen, and the justice and the constable adjourned to a neighbouring
alehouse to take their morning repast.




Chapter iii.

_Containing the inside of a prison._


Mr. Booth (for we shall not trouble you with the rest) was no sooner
arrived in the prison than a number of persons gathered round him, all
demanding garnish; to which Mr. Booth not making a ready answer, as
indeed he did not understand the word, some were going to lay hold of
him, when a person of apparent dignity came up and insisted that no one
should affront the gentleman. This person then, who was no less than the
master or keeper of the prison, turning towards Mr. Booth, acquainted
him that it was the custom of the place for every prisoner upon his
first arrival there to give something to the former prisoners to make
them drink. This, he said, was what they call garnish, and concluded
with advising his new customer to draw his purse upon the present
occasion. Mr. Booth answered that he would very readily comply with this
laudable custom, was it in his power; but that in reality he had not a
shilling in his pocket, and, what was worse, he had not a shilling in
the world.--"Oho! if that be the case," cries the keeper, "it is another
matter, and I have nothing to say." Upon which he immediately departed,
and left poor Booth to the mercy of his companions, who without loss of
time applied themselves to uncasing, as they termed it, and with such
dexterity, that his coat was not only stript off, but out of sight in a
minute.

Mr. Booth was too weak to resist and too wise to complain of this usage.
As soon, therefore, as he was at liberty, and declared free of the
place, he summoned his philosophy, of which he had no inconsiderable
share, to his assistance, and resolved to make himself as easy as
possible under his present circumstances.

Could his own thoughts indeed have suffered him a moment to forget where
he was, the dispositions of the other prisoners might have induced him
to believe that he had been in a happier place: for much the greater
part of his fellow-sufferers, instead of wailing and repining at their
condition, were laughing, singing, and diverting themselves with various
kinds of sports and gambols.

The first person who accosted him was called Blear-eyed Moll, a woman
of no very comely appearance. Her eye (for she had but one), whence she
derived her nickname, was such as that nickname bespoke; besides which,
it had two remarkable qualities; for first, as if Nature had been
careful to provide for her own defect, it constantly looked towards her
blind side; and secondly, the ball consisted almost entirely of white,
or rather yellow, with a little grey spot in the corner, so small that
it was scarce discernible. Nose she had none; for Venus, envious perhaps
at her former charms, had carried off the gristly part; and some earthly
damsel, perhaps, from the same envy, had levelled the bone with the rest
of her face: indeed it was far beneath the bones of her cheeks, which
rose proportionally higher than is usual. About half a dozen ebony teeth
fortified that large and long canal which nature had cut from ear to
ear, at the bottom of which was a chin preposterously short, nature
having turned up the bottom, instead of suffering it to grow to its due
length.

Her body was well adapted to her face; she measured full as much round
the middle as from head to foot; for, besides the extreme breadth of her
back, her vast breasts had long since forsaken their native home, and
had settled themselves a little below the girdle.

I wish certain actresses on the stage, when they are to perform
characters of no amiable cast, would study to dress themselves with the
propriety with which Blear-eyed Moll was now arrayed. For the sake
of our squeamish reader, we shall not descend to particulars; let it
suffice to say, nothing more ragged or more dirty was ever emptied out
of the round-house at St Giles's.

We have taken the more pains to describe this person, for two remarkable
reasons; the one is, that this unlovely creature was taken in the fact
with a very pretty young fellow; the other, which is more productive of
moral lesson, is, that however wretched her fortune may appear to the
reader, she was one of the merriest persons in the whole prison.

Blear-eyed Moll then came up to Mr. Booth with a smile, or rather grin,
on her countenance, and asked him for a dram of gin; and when Booth
assured her that he had not a penny of money, she replied--"D--n your
eyes, I thought by your look you had been a clever fellow, and upon
the snaffling lay [Footnote: A cant term for robbery on the highway] at
least; but, d--n your body and eyes, I find you are some sneaking budge
[Footnote: Another cant term for pilfering] rascal." She then launched
forth a volley of dreadful oaths, interlarded with some language not
proper to be repeated here, and was going to lay hold on poor Booth,
when a tall prisoner, who had been very earnestly eying Booth for some
time, came up, and, taking her by the shoulder, flung her off at some
distance, cursing her for a b--h, and bidding her let the gentleman
alone.

This person was not himself of the most inviting aspect. He was
long-visaged, and pale, with a red beard of above a fortnight's growth.
He was attired in a brownish-black coat, which would have shewed more
holes than it did, had not the linen, which appeared through it, been
entirely of the same colour with the cloth.

This gentleman, whose name was Robinson, addressed himself very civilly
to Mr. Booth, and told him he was sorry to see one of his appearance in
that place: "For as to your being without your coat, sir," says he, "I
can easily account for that; and, indeed, dress is the least part which
distinguishes a gentleman." At which words he cast a significant look
on his own coat, as if he desired they should be applied to himself. He
then proceeded in the following manner:

"I perceive, sir, you are but just arrived in this dismal place, which
is, indeed, rendered more detestable by the wretches who inhabit it than
by any other circumstance; but even these a wise man will soon bring
himself to bear with indifference; for what is, is; and what must be,
must be. The knowledge of this, which, simple as it appears, is in truth
the heighth of all philosophy, renders a wise man superior to every
evil which can befall him. I hope, sir, no very dreadful accident is the
cause of your coming hither; but, whatever it was, you may be assured it
could not be otherwise; for all things happen by an inevitable fatality;
and a man can no more resist the impulse of fate than a wheelbarrow can
the force of its driver."

Besides the obligation which Mr. Robinson had conferred on Mr. Booth in
delivering him from the insults of Blear-eyed Moll, there was something
in the manner of Robinson which, notwithstanding the meanness of his
dress, seemed to distinguish him from the crowd of wretches who swarmed
in those regions; and, above all, the sentiments which he had just
declared very nearly coincided with those of Mr. Booth: this gentleman
was what they call a freethinker; that is to say, a deist, or, perhaps,
an atheist; for, though he did not absolutely deny the existence of a
God, yet he entirely denied his providence. A doctrine which, if it is
not downright atheism, hath a direct tendency towards it; and, as Dr
Clarke observes, may soon be driven into it. And as to Mr. Booth, though
he was in his heart an extreme well-wisher to religion (for he was an
honest man), yet his notions of it were very slight and uncertain.
To say truth, he was in the wavering condition so finely described by
Claudian:

                          labefacta cadelat
     Religio, causaeque--viam non sponte sequebar
     Alterius; vacua quae currere semina motu
     Affirmat; magnumque novas fer inane figures
     Fortuna, non arte, regi; quae numina sensu
     Ambiguo, vel nulla futat, vel nescia nostri.

This way of thinking, or rather of doubting, he had contracted from the
same reasons which Claudian assigns, and which had induced Brutus in his
latter days to doubt the existence of that virtue which he had all his
life cultivated. In short, poor Booth imagined that a larger share of
misfortunes had fallen to his lot than he had merited; and this led
him, who (though a good classical scholar) was not deeply learned in
religious matters, into a disadvantageous opinion of Providence. A
dangerous way of reasoning, in which our conclusions are not only too
hasty, from an imperfect view of things, but we are likewise liable to
much error from partiality to ourselves; viewing our virtues and vices
as through a perspective, in which we turn the glass always to our own
advantage, so as to diminish the one, and as greatly to magnify the
other.

From the above reasons, it can be no wonder that Mr. Booth did not
decline the acquaintance of this person, in a place which could not
promise to afford him any better. He answered him, therefore, with great
courtesy, as indeed he was of a very good and gentle disposition, and,
after expressing a civil surprize at meeting him there, declared himself
to be of the same opinion with regard to the necessity of human actions;
adding, however, that he did not believe men were under any blind
impulse or direction of fate, but that every man acted merely from the
force of that passion which was uppermost in his mind, and could do no
otherwise.

A discourse now ensued between the two gentlemen on the necessity
arising from the impulse of fate, and the necessity arising from the
impulse of passion, which, as it will make a pretty pamphlet of itself,
we shall reserve for some future opportunity. When this was ended they
set forward to survey the gaol and the prisoners, with the several
cases of whom Mr. Robinson, who had been some time under confinement,
undertook to make Mr. Booth acquainted.




Chapter iv.

_Disclosing further secrets of the prison-house._


The first persons whom they passed by were three men in fetters, who
were enjoying themselves very merrily over a bottle of wine and a
pipe of tobacco. These, Mr. Robinson informed his friend, were three
street-robbers, and were all certain of being hanged the ensuing
sessions. So inconsiderable an object, said he, is misery to light
minds, when it is at any distance.

A little farther they beheld a man prostrate on the ground, whose heavy
groans and frantic actions plainly indicated the highest disorder of
mind. This person was, it seems, committed for a small felony; and his
wife, who then lay-in, upon hearing the news, had thrown herself from
a window two pair of stairs high, by which means he had, in all
probability, lost both her and his child.

A very pretty girl then advanced towards them, whose beauty Mr. Booth
could not help admiring the moment he saw her; declaring, at the same
time, he thought she had great innocence in her countenance. Robinson
said she was committed thither as an idle and disorderly person, and a
common street-walker. As she past by Mr. Booth, she damned his eyes, and
discharged a volley of words, every one of which was too indecent to be
repeated.

They now beheld a little creature sitting by herself in a corner, and
crying bitterly. This girl, Mr. Robinson said, was committed because her
father-in-law, who was in the grenadier guards, had sworn that he was
afraid of his life, or of some bodily harm which she would do him,
and she could get no sureties for keeping the peace; for which reason
justice Thrasher had committed her to prison.

A great noise now arose, occasioned by the prisoners all flocking to see
a fellow whipt for petty larceny, to which he was condemned by the court
of quarter-sessions; but this soon ended in the disappointment of the
spectators; for the fellow, after being stript, having advanced another
sixpence, was discharged untouched.

This was immediately followed by another bustle; Blear-eyed Moll,
and several of her companions, having got possession of a man who was
committed for certain odious unmanlike practices, not fit to be named,
were giving him various kinds of discipline, and would probably have put
an end to him, had he not been rescued out of their hands by authority.

When this bustle was a little allayed, Mr. Booth took notice of a young
woman in rags sitting on the ground, and supporting the head of an
old man in her lap, who appeared to be giving up the ghost. These, Mr.
Robinson informed him, were father and daughter; that the latter was
committed for stealing a loaf, in order to support the former, and the
former for receiving it, knowing it to be stolen.

A well-drest man then walked surlily by them, whom Mr. Robinson reported
to have been committed on an indictment found against him for a most
horrid perjury; but, says he, we expect him to be bailed today. "Good
Heaven!" cries Booth, "can such villains find bail, and is no person
charitable enough to bail that poor father and daughter?" "Oh! sir,"
answered Robinson, "the offence of the daughter, being felony, is held
not to be bailable in law; whereas perjury is a misdemeanor only;
and therefore persons who are even indicted for it are, nevertheless,
capable of being bailed. Nay, of all perjuries, that of which this man
is indicted is the worst; for it was with an intention of taking away
the life of an innocent person by form of law. As to perjuries in civil
matters, they are not so very criminal." "They are not," said Booth;
"and yet even these are a most flagitious offence, and worthy the
highest punishment." "Surely they ought to be distinguished," answered
Robinson, "from the others: for what is taking away a little property
from a man, compared to taking away his life and his reputation, and
ruining his family into the bargain?--I hope there can be no comparison
in the crimes, and I think there ought to be none in the punishment.
However, at present, the punishment of all perjury is only pillory and
transportation for seven years; and, as it is a traversable and bailable
offence, methods are found to escape any punishment at all."[Footnote:
By removing the indictment by _certiorari_ into the King's Bench, the
trial is so long postponed, and the costs are so highly encreased, that
prosecutors are often tired out, and some incapacitated from pursuing.
_Verbum sapienti._]

Booth exprest great astonishment at this, when his attention was
suddenly diverted by the most miserable object that he had yet seen.
This was a wretch almost naked, and who bore in his countenance, joined
to an appearance of honesty, the marks of poverty, hunger, and disease.
He had, moreover, a wooden leg, and two or three scars on his forehead.
"The case of this poor man is, indeed, unhappy enough," said Robinson.
"He hath served his country, lost his limb, and received several wounds
at the siege of Gibraltar. When he was discharged from the hospital
abroad he came over to get into that of Chelsea, but could not
immediately, as none of his officers were then in England. In the mean
time, he was one day apprehended and committed hither on suspicion of
stealing three herrings from a fishmonger. He was tried several months
ago for this offence, and acquitted; indeed, his innocence manifestly
appeared at the trial; but he was brought back again for his fees, and
here he hath lain ever since."

Booth exprest great horror at this account, and declared, if he had only
so much money in his pocket, he would pay his fees for him; but added
that he was not possessed of a single farthing in the world.

Robinson hesitated a moment, and then said, with a smile, "I am going to
make you, sir, a very odd proposal after your last declaration; but what
say you to a game at cards? it will serve to pass a tedious hour, and
may divert your thoughts from more unpleasant speculations."

I do not imagine Booth would have agreed to this; for, though some
love of gaming had been formerly amongst his faults, yet he was not so
egregiously addicted to that vice as to be tempted by the shabby plight
of Robinson, who had, if I may so express myself, no charms for
a gamester. If he had, however, any such inclinations, he had no
opportunity to follow them, for, before he could make any answer to
Robinson's proposal, a strapping wench came up to Booth, and, taking
hold of his arm, asked him to walk aside with her; saying, "What a pox,
are you such a fresh cull that you do not know this fellow? why, he is
a gambler, and committed for cheating at play. There is not such a
pickpocket in the whole quad."[Footnote: A cant word for a prison.]

A scene of altercation now ensued between Robinson and the lady, which
ended in a bout at fisticuffs, in which the lady was greatly superior to
the philosopher.

While the two combatants were engaged, a grave-looking man, rather
better drest than the majority of the company, came up to Mr. Booth,
and, taking him aside, said, "I am sorry, sir, to see a gentleman,
as you appear to be, in such intimacy with that rascal, who makes no
scruple of disowning all revealed religion. As for crimes, they are
human errors, and signify but little; nay, perhaps the worse a man is
by nature, the more room there is for grace. The spirit is active, and
loves best to inhabit those minds where it may meet with the most work.
Whatever your crime be, therefore I would not have you despair, but
rather rejoice at it; for perhaps it may be the means of your being
called." He ran on for a considerable time with this cant, without
waiting for an answer, and ended in declaring himself a methodist.

Just as the methodist had finished his discourse, a beautiful young
woman was ushered into the gaol. She was genteel and well drest, and
did not in the least resemble those females whom Mr. Booth had hitherto
seen. The constable had no sooner delivered her at the gate than she
asked with a commanding voice for the keeper; and, when he arrived, she
said to him, "Well, sir, whither am I to be conducted? I hope I am not
to take up my lodging with these creatures." The keeper answered, with a
kind of surly respect, "Madam, we have rooms for those who can afford
to pay for them." At these words she pulled a handsome purse from
her pocket, in which many guineas chinked, saying, with an air of
indignation, "That she was not come thither on account of poverty." The
keeper no sooner viewed the purse than his features became all softened
in an instant; and, with all the courtesy of which he was master, he
desired the lady to walk with him, assuring her that she should have the
best apartment in his house.

Mr. Booth was now left alone; for the methodist had forsaken him,
having, as the phrase of the sect is, searched him to the bottom. In
fact, he had thoroughly examined every one of Mr. Booth's pockets; from
which he had conveyed away a penknife and an iron snuff-box, these being
all the moveables which were to be found.

Booth was standing near the gate of the prison when the young lady above
mentioned was introduced into the yard. He viewed her features very
attentively, and was persuaded that he knew her. She was indeed so
remarkably handsome, that it was hardly possible for any who had ever
seen her to forget her. He enquired of one of the underkeepers if the
name of the prisoner lately arrived was not Matthews; to which he was
answered that her name was not Matthews but Vincent, and that she was
committed for murder.

The latter part of this information made Mr. Booth suspect his memory
more than the former; for it was very possible that she might have
changed her name; but he hardly thought she could so far have changed
her nature as to be guilty of a crime so very incongruous with her
former gentle manners: for Miss Matthews had both the birth and
education of a gentlewoman. He concluded, therefore, that he was
certainly mistaken, and rested satisfied without any further enquiry.




Chapter v.

_Containing certain adventures which befel Mr. Booth in the prison._


The remainder of the day Mr. Booth spent in melancholy contemplation
on his present condition. He was destitute of the common necessaries of
life, and consequently unable to subsist where he was; nor was there a
single person in town to whom he could, with any reasonable hope, apply
for his delivery. Grief for some time banished the thoughts of food from
his mind; but in the morning nature began to grow uneasy for want of
her usual nourishment: for he had not eat a morsel during the last forty
hours. A penny loaf, which is, it seems, the ordinary allowance to the
prisoners in Bridewell, was now delivered him; and while he was eating
this a man brought him a little packet sealed up, informing him that it
came by a messenger, who said it required no answer.

Mr. Booth now opened his packet, and, after unfolding several pieces of
blank paper successively, at last discovered a guinea, wrapt with great
care in the inmost paper. He was vastly surprized at this sight, as he
had few if any friends from whom he could expect such a favour, slight
as it was; and not one of his friends, as he was apprized, knew of his
confinement. As there was no direction to the packet, nor a word of
writing contained in it, he began to suspect that it was delivered to
the wrong person; and being one of the most untainted honesty, he found
out the man who gave it him, and again examined him concerning the
person who brought it, and the message delivered with it. The man
assured Booth that he had made no mistake; saying, "If your name is
Booth, sir, I am positive you are the gentleman to whom the parcel I
gave you belongs."

The most scrupulous honesty would, perhaps, in such a situation,
have been well enough satisfied in finding no owner for the guinea;
especially when proclamation had been made in the prison that Mr. Booth
had received a packet without any direction, to which, if any person had
any claim, and would discover the contents, he was ready to deliver it
to such claimant. No such claimant being found (I mean none who knew
the contents; for many swore that they expected just such a packet, and
believed it to be their property), Mr. Booth very calmly resolved to
apply the money to his own use.

The first thing after redemption of the coat, which Mr. Booth, hungry as
he was, thought of, was to supply himself with snuff, which he had long,
to his great sorrow, been without. On this occasion he presently missed
that iron box which the methodist had so dexterously conveyed out of his
pocket, as we mentioned in the last chapter.

He no sooner missed this box than he immediately suspected that the
gambler was the person who had stolen it; nay, so well was he assured
of this man's guilt, that it may, perhaps, be improper to say he barely
suspected it. Though Mr. Booth was, as we have hinted, a man of a very
sweet disposition, yet was he rather overwarm. Having, therefore, no
doubt concerning the person of the thief, he eagerly sought him out, and
very bluntly charged him with the fact.

The gambler, whom I think we should now call the philosopher, received
this charge without the least visible emotion either of mind or muscle.
After a short pause of a few moments, he answered, with great solemnity,
as follows: "Young man, I am entirely unconcerned at your groundless
suspicion. He that censures a stranger, as I am to you, without any
cause, makes a worse compliment to himself than to the stranger. You
know yourself, friend; you know not me. It is true, indeed, you heard me
accused of being a cheat and a gamester; but who is my accuser? Look at
my apparel, friend; do thieves and gamesters wear such cloaths as these?
play is my folly, not my vice; it is my impulse, and I have been a
martyr to it. Would a gamester have asked another to play when he
could have lost eighteen-pence and won nothing? However, if you are not
satisfied, you may search my pockets; the outside of all but one will
serve your turn, and in that one there is the eighteen-pence I told you
of." He then turned up his cloaths; and his pockets entirely resembled
the pitchers of the Belides.

Booth was a little staggered at this defence. He said the real value
of the iron box was too inconsiderable to mention; but that he had a
capricious value for it, for the sake of the person who gave it him;
"for, though it is not," said he, "worth sixpence, I would willingly
give a crown to any one who would bring it me again."

Robinson answered, "If that be the case, you have nothing more to do
but to signify your intention in the prison, and I am well convinced you
will not be long without regaining the possession of your snuff-box."

This advice was immediately followed, and with success, the methodist
presently producing the box, which, he said, he had found, and should
have returned it before, had he known the person to whom it belonged;
adding, with uplifted eyes, that the spirit would not suffer him
knowingly to detain the goods of another, however inconsiderable the
value was. "Why so, friend?" said Robinson. "Have I not heard you often
say, the wickeder any man was the better, provided he was what you call
a believer?" "You mistake me," cries Cooper (for that was the name
of the methodist): "no man can be wicked after he is possessed by the
spirit. There is a wide difference between the days of sin and the
days of grace. I have been a sinner myself." "I believe thee," cries
Robinson, with a sneer. "I care not," answered the other, "what an
atheist believes. I suppose you would insinuate that I stole the
snuff-box; but I value not your malice; the Lord knows my innocence."
He then walked off with the reward; and Booth, turning to Robinson, very
earnestly asked pardon for his groundless suspicion; which the other,
without any hesitation, accorded him, saying, "You never accused me,
sir; you suspected some gambler, with whose character I have no concern.
I should be angry with a friend or acquaintance who should give a hasty
credit to any allegation against me; but I have no reason to be offended
with you for believing what the woman, and the rascal who is just gone,
and who is committed here for a pickpocket, which you did not perhaps
know, told you to my disadvantage. And if you thought me to be a gambler
you had just reason to suspect any ill of me; for I myself am confined
here by the perjury of one of those villains, who, having cheated me of
my money at play, and hearing that I intended to apply to a magistrate
against him, himself began the attack, and obtained a warrant against
me of Justice Thrasher, who, without hearing one speech in my defence,
committed me to this place."

Booth testified great compassion at this account; and, he having invited
Robinson to dinner, they spent that day together. In the afternoon Booth
indulged his friend with a game at cards; at first for halfpence and
afterwards for shillings, when fortune so favoured Robinson that he did
not leave the other a single shilling in his pocket.

A surprizing run of luck in a gamester is often mistaken for somewhat
else by persons who are not over-zealous believers in the divinity of
fortune. I have known a stranger at Bath, who hath happened fortunately
(I might almost say unfortunately) to have four by honours in his hand
almost every time he dealt for a whole evening, shunned universally
by the whole company the next day. And certain it is, that Mr. Booth,
though of a temper very little inclined to suspicion, began to waver in
his opinion whether the character given by Mr. Robinson of himself, or
that which the others gave of him, was the truer.

In the morning hunger paid him a second visit, and found him again in
the same situation as before. After some deliberation, therefore, he
resolved to ask Robinson to lend him a shilling or two of that money
which was lately his own. And this experiments he thought, would confirm
him either in a good or evil opinion of that gentleman.

To this demand Robinson answered, with great alacrity, that he should
very gladly have complied, had not fortune played one of her jade tricks
with him: "for since my winning of you," said he, "I have been stript
not only of your money but my own." He was going to harangue farther;
but Booth, with great indignation, turned from him.

This poor gentleman had very little time to reflect on his own misery,
or the rascality, as it appeared to him, of the other, when the same
person who had the day before delivered him the guinea from the unknown
hand, again accosted him, and told him a lady in the house (so he
expressed himself) desired the favour of his company.

Mr. Booth immediately obeyed the message, and was conducted into a room
in the prison, where he was presently convinced that Mrs. Vincent was no
other than his old acquaintance Miss Matthews.




Chapter vi

_Containing the extraordinary behaviour of Miss Matthews on her meeting
with Booth, and some endeavours to prove, by reason and authority, that
it is possible for a woman to appear to be what she really is not._


Eight or nine years had past since any interview between Mr. Booth
and Miss Matthews; and their meeting now in so extraordinary a place
affected both of them with an equal surprize.

After some immaterial ceremonies, the lady acquainted Mr. Booth that,
having heard there was a person in the prison who knew her by the name
of Matthews, she had great curiosity to inquire who he was, whereupon he
had been shewn to her from the window of the house; that she immediately
recollected him, and, being informed of his distressful situation, for
which she expressed great concern, she had sent him that guinea which
he had received the day before; and then proceeded to excuse herself
for not having desired to see him at that time, when she was under the
greatest disorder and hurry of spirits.

Booth made many handsome acknowledgments of her favour; and added that
he very little wondered at the disorder of her spirits, concluding that
he was heartily concerned at seeing her there; "but I hope, madam," said
he--

Here he hesitated; upon which, bursting into an agony of tears, she
cried out, "O captain! captain! many extraordinary things have passed
since last I saw you. O gracious heaven! did I ever expect that this
would be the next place of our meeting?"

She then flung herself into her chair, where she gave a loose to
her passion, whilst he, in the most affectionate and tender manner,
endeavoured to soothe and comfort her; but passion itself did probably
more for its own relief than all his friendly consolations. Having
vented this in a large flood of tears, she became pretty well composed;
but Booth unhappily mentioning her father, she again relapsed into an
agony, and cried out, "Why? why will you repeat the name of that dear
man? I have disgraced him, Mr. Booth, I am unworthy the name of his
daughter."--Here passion again stopped her words, and discharged itself
in tears.

After this second vent of sorrow or shame, or, if the reader pleases, of
rage, she once more recovered from her agonies. To say the truth, these
are, I believe, as critical discharges of nature as any of those which
are so called by the physicians, and do more effectually relieve the
mind than any remedies with which the whole materia medica of philosophy
can supply it.

When Mrs. Vincent had recovered her faculties, she perceived Booth
standing silent, with a mixture of concern and astonishment in his
countenance; then addressing herself to him with an air of most
bewitching softness, of which she was a perfect mistress, she said,
"I do not wonder at your amazement, Captain Booth, nor indeed at the
concern which you so plainly discover for me; for I well know the
goodness of your nature: but, O, Mr. Booth! believe me, when you know
what hath happened since our last meeting, your concern will be raised,
however your astonishment may cease. O, sir! you are a stranger to the
cause of my sorrows."

"I hope I am, madam," answered he; "for I cannot believe what I have
heard in the prison--surely murder"--at which words she started from her
chair, repeating, "Murder! oh! it is music in my ears!--You have heard
then the cause of my commitment, my glory, my delight, my reparation!
Yes, my old friend, this is the hand, this is the arm that drove the
penknife to his heart. Unkind fortune, that not one drop of his blood
reached my hand.--Indeed, sir, I would never have washed it from
it.--But, though I have not the happiness to see it on my hand, I have
the glorious satisfaction of remembering I saw it run in rivers on
the floor; I saw it forsake his cheeks, I saw him fall a martyr to my
revenge. And is the killing a villain to be called murder? perhaps
the law calls it so.--Let it call it what it will, or punish me as it
pleases.---Punish me!--no, no---that is not in the power of man--not of
that monster man, Mr. Booth. I am undone, am revenged, and have now no
more business for life; let them take it from me when they will."

Our poor gentleman turned pale with horror at this speech, and the
ejaculation of "Good heavens! what do I hear?" burst spontaneously from
his lips; nor can we wonder at this, though he was the bravest of men;
for her voice, her looks, her gestures, were properly adapted to the
sentiments she exprest. Such indeed was her image, that neither could
Shakspear describe, nor Hogarth paint, nor Clive act, a fury in higher
perfection.

[Illustration: She then gave a loose to her passions]

"What do you hear?" reiterated she. "You hear the resentment of the most
injured of women. You have heard, you say, of the murder; but do you
know the cause, Mr. Booth? Have you since your return to England visited
that country where we formerly knew one another? tell me, do you know my
wretched story? tell me that, my friend."

Booth hesitated for an answer; indeed, he had heard some imperfect
stories, not much to her advantage. She waited not till he had formed
a speech; but cried, "Whatever you may have heard, you cannot be
acquainted with all the strange accidents which have occasioned your
seeing me in a place which at our last parting was so unlikely that I
should ever have been found in; nor can you know the cause of all that
I have uttered, and which, I am convinced, you never expected to have
heard from my mouth. If these circumstances raise your curiosity, I will
satisfy it."

He answered, that curiosity was too mean a word to express his ardent
desire of knowing her story. Upon which, with very little previous
ceremony, she began to relate what is written in the following chapter.

But before we put an end to this it may be necessary to whisper a word
or two to the critics, who have, perhaps, begun to express no less
astonishment than Mr. Booth, that a lady in whom we had remarked a most
extraordinary power of displaying softness should, the very next moment
after the words were out of her mouth, express sentiments becoming
the lips of a Dalila, Jezebel, Medea, Semiramis, Parysatis, Tanaquil,
Livilla, Messalina, Agrippina, Brunichilde, Elfrida, Lady Macbeth,
Joan of Naples, Christina of Sweden, Katharine Hays, Sarah Malcolm, Con
Philips,[Footnote: Though last not least.] or any other heroine of the
tender sex, which history, sacred or profane, ancient or modern, false
or true, hath recorded.

We desire such critics to remember that it is the same English climate,
in which, on the lovely 10th of June, under a serene sky, the amorous
Jacobite, kissing the odoriferous zephyr's breath, gathers a nosegay
of white roses to deck the whiter breast of Celia; and in which, on the
11th of June, the very next day, the boisterous Boreas, roused by the
hollow thunder, rushes horrible through the air, and, driving the wet
tempest before him, levels the hope of the husbandman with the earth,
dreadful remembrance of the consequences of the Revolution.

Again, let it be remembered that this is the selfsame Celia, all tender,
soft, and delicate, who with a voice, the sweetness of which the
Syrens might envy, warbles the harmonious song in praise of the young
adventurer; and again, the next day, or, perhaps the next hour, with
fiery eyes, wrinkled brows, and foaming lips, roars forth treason and
nonsense in a political argument with some fair one of a different
principle.

Or, if the critic be a Whig, and consequently dislikes such kind of
similes, as being too favourable to Jacobitism, let him be contented
with the following story:

I happened in my youth to sit behind two ladies in a side-box at a play,
where, in the balcony on the opposite side, was placed the inimitable
B---y C---s, in company with a young fellow of no very formal, or
indeed sober, appearance. One of the ladies, I remember, said to the
other--"Did you ever see anything look so modest and so innocent as that
girl over the way? what pity it is such a creature should be in the
way of ruin, as I am afraid she is, by her being alone with that young
fellow!" Now this lady was no bad physiognomist, for it was impossible
to conceive a greater appearance of modesty, innocence, and simplicity,
than what nature had displayed in the countenance of that girl; and yet,
all appearances notwithstanding, I myself (remember, critic, it was in
my youth) had a few mornings before seen that very identical picture of
all those engaging qualities in bed with a rake at a bagnio, smoaking
tobacco, drinking punch, talking obscenity, and swearing and cursing
with all the impudence and impiety of the lowest and most abandoned
trull of a soldier.




Chapter vii.

_In which Miss Matthews begins her history._


Miss Matthews, having barred the door on the inside as securely as it
was before barred on the outside, proceeded as follows:

"You may imagine I am going to begin my history at the time when you
left the country; but I cannot help reminding you of something which
happened before. You will soon recollect the incident; but I believe you
little know the consequence either at that time or since. Alas! I could
keep a secret then! now I have no secrets; the world knows all; and it
is not worth my while to conceal anything. Well!--You will not wonder,
I believe.--I protest I can hardly tell it you, even now.---But I am
convinced you have too good an opinion of yourself to be surprized at
any conquest you may have made.---Few men want that good opinion--and
perhaps very few had ever more reason for it. Indeed, Will, you was a
charming fellow in those days; nay, you are not much altered for the
worse now, at least in the opinion of some women; for your complexion
and features are grown much more masculine than they were." Here Booth
made her a low bow, most probably with a compliment; and after a little
hesitation she again proceeded.---"Do you remember a contest which
happened at an assembly, betwixt myself and Miss Johnson, about standing
uppermost? you was then my partner; and young Williams danced with
the other lady. The particulars are not now worth mentioning, though
I suppose you have long since forgot them. Let it suffice that you
supported my claim, and Williams very sneakingly gave up that of his
partner, who was, with much difficulty, afterwards prevailed to dance
with him. You said--I am sure I repeat the words exactly--that you
would not for the world affront any lady there; but that you thought you
might, without any such danger declare, that there was no assembly in
which that lady, meaning your humble servant, was not worthy of the
uppermost place; 'nor will I,' said you, 'suffer, the first duke in
England, when she is at the uppermost end of the room, and hath called
her dance, to lead his partner above her.'

"What made this the more pleasing to me was, that I secretly hated Miss
Johnson. Will you have the reason? why, then, I will tell you honestly,
she was my rival. That word perhaps astonishes you, as you never, I
believe, heard of any one who made his addresses to me; and indeed my
heart was, till that night, entirely indifferent to all mankind: I
mean, then, that she was my rival for praise, for beauty, for dress, for
fortune, and consequently for admiration. My triumph on this conquest
is not to be expressed any more than my delight in the person to whom I
chiefly owed it. The former, I fancy, was visible to the whole company;
and I desired it should be so; but the latter was so well concealed,
that no one, I am confident, took any notice of it. And yet you
appeared to me that night to be an angel. You looked, you danced, you
spoke-everything charmed me."

"Good Heavens!" cries Booth, "is it possible you should do me so much
unmerited honour, and I should be dunce enough not to perceive the least
symptom?"

"I assure you," answered she, "I did all I could to prevent you; and yet
I almost hated you for not seeing through what I strove to hide. Why,
Mr. Booth, was you not more quick-sighted?--I will answer for you--your
affections were more happily disposed of to a much better woman than
myself, whom you married soon afterwards. I should ask you for her,
Mr. Booth; I should have asked you for her before; but I am unworthy of
asking for her, or of calling her my acquaintance."

Booth stopt her short, as she was running into another fit of passion,
and begged her to omit all former matters, and acquaint him with that
part of her history to which he was an entire stranger.

She then renewed her discourse as follows: "You know, Mr. Booth, I
soon afterwards left that town, upon the death of my grandmother, and
returned home to my father's house; where I had not been long arrived
before some troops of dragoons came to quarter in our neighbourhood.
Among the officers there was a cornet whose detested name was Hebbers,
a name I could scarce repeat, had I not at the same time the pleasure
to reflect that he is now no more. My father, you know, who is a
hearty well-wisher to the present government, used always to invite
the officers to his house; so did he these. Nor was it long before this
cornet in so particular a manner recommended himself to the poor old
gentleman (I cannot think of him without tears), that our house became
his principal habitation, and he was rarely at his quarters, unless when
his superior officers obliged him to be there. I shall say nothing of
his person, nor could that be any recommendation to a man; it was
such, however, as no woman could have made an objection to. Nature had
certainly wrapt up her odious work in a most beautiful covering. To
say the truth, he was the handsomest man, except one only, that I
ever saw--I assure you, I have seen a handsomer---but--well.--He
had, besides, all the qualifications of a gentleman; was genteel and
extremely polite; spoke French well, and danced to a miracle; but what
chiefly recommended him to my father was his skill in music, of which
you know that dear man was the most violent lover. I wish he was not
too susceptible of flattery on that head; for I have heard Hebbers often
greatly commend my father's performance, and have observed that the good
man was wonderfully pleased with such commendations. To say the truth,
it is the only way I can account for the extraordinary friendship which
my father conceived for this person; such a friendship, that he at last
became a part of our family.

"This very circumstance, which, as I am convinced, strongly recommended
him to my father, had the very contrary effect with me: I had never any
delight in music, and it was not without much difficulty I was prevailed
on to learn to play on the harpsichord, in which I had made a very
slender progress. As this man, therefore, was frequently the occasion of
my being importuned to play against my will, I began to entertain some
dislike for him on that account; and as to his person, I assure you, I
long continued to look on it with great indifference.

"How strange will the art of this man appear to you presently, who had
sufficient address to convert that very circumstance which had at first
occasioned my dislike into the first seeds of affection for him!

"You have often, I believe, heard my sister Betty play on the
harpsichord; she was, indeed, reputed the best performer in the whole
country.

"I was the farthest in the world from regarding this perfection of hers
with envy. In reality, perhaps, I despised all perfection of this kind:
at least, as I had neither skill nor ambition to excel this way, I
looked upon it as a matter of mere indifference.

"Hebbers first put this emulation in my head. He took great pains to
persuade me that I had much greater abilities of the musical kind than
my sister, and that I might with the greatest ease, if I pleased, excel
her; offering me, at the same time, his assistance if I would resolve to
undertake it.

"When he had sufficiently inflamed my ambition, in which, perhaps, he
found too little difficulty, the continual praises of my sister, which
before I had disregarded, became more and more nauseous in my ears; and
the rather, as, music being the favourite passion of my father, I became
apprehensive (not without frequent hints from Hebbers of that nature)
that she might gain too great a preference in his favour.

"To my harpsichord then I applied myself night and day, with such
industry and attention, that I soon began to perform in a tolerable
manner. I do not absolutely say I excelled my sister, for many were of
a different opinion; but, indeed, there might be some partiality in all
that.

"Hebbers, at least, declared himself on my side, and nobody could doubt
his judgment. He asserted openly that I played in the better manner of
the two; and one day, when I was playing to him alone, he affected to
burst into a rapture of admiration, and, squeezing me gently by the
hand, said, There, madam, I now declare you excel your sister as much in
music as, added he in a whispering sigh, you do her, and all the world,
in every other charm.

"No woman can bear any superiority in whatever thing she desires to
excel in. I now began to hate all the admirers of my sister, to be
uneasy at every commendation bestowed on her skill in music, and
consequently to love Hebbers for the preference which he gave to mine.

"It was now that I began to survey the handsome person of Hebbers with
pleasure. And here, Mr. Booth, I will betray to you the grand secret
of our sex.---Many women, I believe, do, with great innocence, and even
with great indifference, converse with men of the finest persons; but
this I am confident may be affirmed with truth, that, when once a woman
comes to ask this question of herself, Is the man whom I like for some
other reason, handsome? her fate and his too, very strongly depend on
her answering in the affirmative.

"Hebbers no sooner perceived that he had made an impression on my
heart, of which I am satisfied I gave him too undeniable tokens, than he
affected on a sudden to shun me in the most apparent manner. He wore
the most melancholy air in my presence, and, by his dejected looks and
sighs, firmly persuaded me that there was some secret sorrow labouring
in his bosom; nor will it be difficult for you to imagine to what cause
I imputed it.

"Whilst I was wishing for his declaration of a passion in which I
thought I could not be mistaken, and at the same time trembling whenever
we met with the apprehension of this very declaration, the widow Carey
came from London to make us a visit, intending to stay the whole summer
at our house.

"Those who know Mrs. Carey will scarce think I do her an injury in
saying she is far from being handsome; and yet she is as finished a
coquette as if she had the highest beauty to support that character.
But perhaps you have seen her; and if you have I am convinced you will
readily subscribe to my opinion."

Booth answered he had not; and then she proceeded as in the following
chapter.




Chapter viii

_The history of Miss Matthews continued_.


"This young lady had not been three days with us before Hebbers grew so
particular with her, that it was generally observed; and my poor father,
who, I believe, loved the cornet as if he had been his son, began to
jest on the occasion, as one who would not be displeased at throwing a
good jointure into the arms of his friend.

"You will easily guess, sir, the disposition of my mind on this
occasion; but I was not permitted to suffer long under it; for one day,
when Hebbers was alone with me, he took an opportunity of expressing
his abhorrence at the thoughts of marrying for interest, contrary to his
inclinations. I was warm on the subject, and, I believe, went so far as
to say that none but fools and villains did so. He replied, with a sigh,
Yes, madam, but what would you think of a man whose heart is all the
while bleeding for another woman, to whom he would willingly sacrifice
the world; but, because he must sacrifice her interest as well as his
own, never durst even give her a hint of that passion which was preying
on his very vitals? 'Do you believe, Miss Fanny, there is such a wretch
on earth?' I answered, with an assumed coldness, I did not believe there
was. He then took me gently by the hand, and, with a look so tender that
I cannot describe it, vowed he was himself that wretch. Then starting,
as if conscious of an error committed, he cried with a faltering voice,
'What am I saying? Pardon me, Miss Fanny; since I beg only your pity, I
never will ask for more.--' At these words, hearing my father coming
up, I betrayed myself entirely, if, indeed, I had not done it before. I
hastily withdrew my hand, crying, Hush! for heaven's sake, my father
is just coming in; my blushes, my look, and my accent, telling him, I
suppose, all which he wished to know.

"A few days now brought matters to an eclaircissement between us; the
being undeceived in what had given me so much uneasiness gave me a
pleasure too sweet to be resisted. To triumph over the widow, for whom
I had in a very short time contracted a most inveterate hatred, was a
pride not to be described. Hebbers appeared to me to be the cause of
all this happiness. I doubted not but that he had the most disinterested
passion for me, and thought him every way worthy of its return. I did
return it, and accepted him as my lover.

"He declared the greatest apprehensions of my father's suspicion, though
I am convinced these were causeless had his designs been honourable. To
blind these, I consented that he should carry on sham addresses to the
widow, who was now a constant jest between us; and he pretended from
time to time to acquaint me faithfully with everything that past at his
interviews with her; nor was this faithless woman wanting in her part
of the deceit. She carried herself to me all the while with a shew of
affection, and pretended to have the utmost friendship for me But such
are the friendships of women!"

At this remark, Booth, though enough affected at some parts of the
story, had great difficulty to refrain from laughter; but, by good luck,
he escaped being perceived; and the lady went on without interruption.

"I am come now to a part of my narrative in which it is impossible to
be particular without being tedious; for, as to the commerce between
lovers, it is, I believe, much the same in all cases; and there is,
perhaps, scarce a single phrase that hath not been repeated ten millions
of times.

"One thing, however, as I strongly remarked it then, so I will repeat it
to you now. In all our conversations, in moments when he fell into the
warmest raptures, and exprest the greatest uneasiness at the delay
of his joys, he seldom mentioned the word marriage; and never once
solicited a day for that purpose. Indeed, women cannot be cautioned too
much against such lovers; for though I have heard, and perhaps truly, of
some of our sex, of a virtue so exalted, that it is proof against every
temptation; yet the generality, I am afraid, are too much in the power
of a man to whom they have owned an affection. What is called being upon
a good footing is, perhaps, being upon a very dangerous one; and a woman
who hath given her consent to marry can hardly be said to be safe till
she is married.

"And now, sir, I hasten to the period of my ruin. We had a wedding in
our family; my musical sister was married to a young fellow as musical
as herself. Such a match, you may be sure, amongst other festivities,
must have a ball. Oh! Mr. Booth, shall modesty forbid me to remark to
you what past on that occasion? But why do I mention modesty, who
have no pretensions to it? Everything was said and practised on that
occasion, as if the purpose had been to inflame the mind of every
woman present. That effect, I freely own to you, it had with me. Music,
dancing, wine, and the most luscious conversation, in which my poor dear
father innocently joined, raised ideas in me of which I shall for ever
repent; and I wished (why should I deny it?) that it had been my wedding
instead of my sister's.

"The villain Hebbers danced with me that night, and he lost no
opportunity of improving the occasion. In short, the dreadful evening
came. My father, though it was a very unusual thing with him, grew
intoxicated with liquor; most of the men were in the same condition;
nay, I myself drank more than I was accustomed to, enough to inflame,
though not to disorder. I lost my former bed-fellow, my sister, and--you
may, I think, guess the rest--the villain found means to steal to my
chamber, and I was undone.

"Two months I passed in this detested commerce, buying, even then, my
guilty, half-tasted pleasures at too dear a rate, with continual horror
and apprehension; but what have I paid since--what do I pay now, Mr.
Booth? O may my fate be a warning to every woman to keep her innocence,
to resist every temptation, since she is certain to repent of the
foolish bargain. May it be a warning to her to deal with mankind with
care and caution; to shun the least approaches of dishonour, and never
to confide too much in the honesty of a man, nor in her own strength,
where she has so much at stake; let her remember she walks on a
precipice, and the bottomless pit is to receive her if she slips; nay,
if she makes but one false step.

"I ask your pardon, Mr. Booth; I might have spared these exhortations,
since no woman hears me; but you will not wonder at seeing me affected
on this occasion."

Booth declared he was much more surprised at her being able so well to
preserve her temper in recounting her story.

"O sir," answered she, "I am at length reconciled to my fate; and I can
now die with pleasure, since I die revenged. I am not one of those mean
wretches who can sit down and lament their misfortunes. If I ever shed
tears, they are the tears of indignation.--But I will proceed.

"It was my fate now to solicit marriage; and I failed not to do it in
the most earnest manner. He answered me at first with procrastinations,
declaring, from time to time, he would mention it to my father; and
still excusing himself for not doing it. At last he thought on an
expedient to obtain a longer reprieve. This was by pretending that he
should, in a very few weeks, be preferred to the command of a troop; and
then, he said, he could with some confidence propose the match.

"In this delay I was persuaded to acquiesce, and was indeed pretty easy,
for I had not yet the least mistrust of his honour; but what words can
paint my sensations, when one morning he came into my room, with all the
marks of dejection in his countenance, and, throwing an open letter on
the table, said, 'There is news, madam, in that letter which I am unable
to tell you; nor can it give you more concern than it hath given me.'

"This letter was from his captain, to acquaint him that the rout, as
they call it, was arrived, and that they were to march within two days.
And this, I am since convinced, was what he expected, instead of the
preferment which had been made the pretence of delaying our marriage.

"The shock which I felt at reading this was inexpressible, occasioned
indeed principally by the departure of a villain whom I loved. However,
I soon acquired sufficient presence of mind to remember the main point;
and I now insisted peremptorily on his making me immediately his wife,
whatever might be the consequence.

"He seemed thunderstruck at this proposal, being, I suppose, destitute
of any excuse: but I was too impatient to wait for an answer, and cried
out with much eagerness, Sure you cannot hesitate a moment upon this
matter--'Hesitate! madam!' replied he--'what you ask is impossible. Is
this a time for me to mention a thing of this kind to your father?'--My
eyes were now opened all at once--I fell into a rage little short of
madness. Tell not me, I cried, of impossibilities, nor times, nor of my
father---my honour, my reputation, my all are at stake.--I will have no
excuse, no delay--make me your wife this instant, or I will proclaim
you over the face of the whole earth for the greatest of villains. He
answered, with a kind of sneer, 'What will you proclaim, madam?--whose
honour will you injure?' My tongue faltered when I offered to reply,
and I fell into a violent agony, which ended in a fit; nor do I remember
anything more that past till I found myself in the arms of my poor
affrighted father.

"O, Mr. Booth, what was then my situation! I tremble even now from the
reflection.--I must stop a moment. I can go no farther." Booth attempted
all in his power to soothe her; and she soon recovered her powers, and
proceeded in her story.




Chapter ix

_In which Miss Matthews concludes her relation_.


Before I had recovered my senses I had sufficiently betrayed myself to
the best of men, who, instead of upbraiding me, or exerting any anger,
endeavoured to comfort me all he could with assurances that all should
yet be well. This goodness of his affected me with inexpressible
sensations; I prostrated myself before him, embraced and kissed his
knees, and almost dissolved in tears, and a degree of tenderness hardly
to be conceived---But I am running into too minute descriptions.

"Hebbers, seeing me in a fit, had left me, and sent one of the servants
to take care of me. He then ran away like a thief from the house,
without taking his leave of my father, or once thanking him for all
his civilities. He did not stop at his quarters, but made directly
to London, apprehensive, I believe, either of my father or brother's
resentment; for I am convinced he is a coward. Indeed his fear of my
brother was utterly groundless; for I believe he would rather have
thanked any man who had destroyed me; and I am sure I am not in the
least behindhand with him in good wishes.

"All his inveteracy to me had, however, no effect on my father, at least
at that time; for, though the good man took sufficient occasions to
reprimand me for my past offence, he could not be brought to abandon
me. A treaty of marriage was now set on foot, in which my father himself
offered me to Hebbers, with a fortune superior to that which had been
given with my sister; nor could all my brother's remonstrances against
it, as an act of the highest injustice, avail.

"Hebbers entered into the treaty, though not with much warmth. He had
even the assurance to make additional demands on my father, which being
complied with, everything was concluded, and the villain once more
received into the house. He soon found means to obtain my forgiveness
of his former behaviour; indeed, he convinced me, so foolishly blind is
female love, that he had never been to blame.

"When everything was ready for our nuptials, and the day of the ceremony
was to be appointed, in the midst of my happiness I received a letter
from an unknown hand, acquainting me (guess, Mr. Booth, how I was
shocked at receiving it) that Mr. Hebbers was already married to a woman
in a distant part of the kingdom.

"I will not tire you with all that past at our next interview. I
communicated the letter to Hebbers, who, after some little hesitation,
owned the fact, and not only owned it, but had the address to improve it
to his own advantage, to make it the means of satisfying me concerning
all his former delays; which, to say the truth, I was not so much
displeased at imputing to any degree of villany, as I should have been
to impute it to the want of a sufficient warmth of affection, and
though the disappointment of all my hopes, at the very instant of their
expected fruition, threw me into the most violent disorders; yet, when I
came a little to myself, he had no great difficulty to persuade me that
in every instance, with regard to me, Hebbers had acted from no other
motive than from the most ardent and ungovernable love. And there is, I
believe, no crime which a woman will not forgive, when she can derive
it from that fountain. In short, I forgave him all, and am willing to
persuade myself I am not weaker than the rest of my sex. Indeed, Mr.
Booth, he hath a bewitching tongue, and is master of an address that
no woman could resist. I do assure you the charms of his person are his
least perfection, at least in my eye."

Here Booth smiled, but happily without her perceiving it.

"A fresh difficulty (continued she) now arose. This was to excuse the
delay of the ceremony to my father, who every day very earnestly urged
it. This made me so very uneasy, that I at last listened to a proposal,
which, if any one in the days of my innocence, or even a few days
before, had assured me I could have submitted to have thought of,
I should have treated the supposition with the highest contempt and
indignation; nay, I scarce reflect on it now with more horror than
astonishment. In short, I agreed to run away with him--to leave my
father, my reputation, everything which was or ought to have been dear
to me, and to live with this villain as a mistress, since I could not be
his wife.

"Was not this an obligation of the highest and tenderest kind, and had
I not reason to expect every return in the man's power on whom I had
conferred it? I will make short of the remainder of my story, for what
is there of a woman worth relating, after what I have told you?

"Above a year I lived with this man in an obscure court in London,
during which time I had a child by him, whom Heaven, I thank it, hath
been pleased to take to itself.

"During many months he behaved to me with all the apparent tenderness
and even fondness imaginable; but, alas! how poor was my enjoyment of
this compared to what it would have been in another situation? When he
was present, life was barely tolerable: but, when he was absent, nothing
could equal the misery I endured. I past my hours almost entirely alone;
for no company but what I despised, would consort with me. Abroad I
scarce ever went, lest I should meet any of my former acquaintance; for
their sight would have plunged a thousand daggers in my soul. My only
diversion was going very seldom to a play, where I hid myself in the
gallery, with a daughter of the woman of the house. A girl, indeed, of
good sense and many good qualities; but how much beneath me was it to
be the companion of a creature so low! O heavens! when I have seen my
equals glittering in a side-box, how have the thoughts of my lost honour
torn my soul!"

"Pardon me, dear madam," cries Booth, "for interrupting you; but I am
under the utmost anxiety to know what became of your poor father,
for whom I have so great a respect, and who, I am convinced, must so
bitterly feel your loss."

"O Mr. Booth," answered she, "he was scarce ever out of my thoughts. His
dear image still obtruded itself in my mind, and I believe would have
broken my heart, had I not taken a very preposterous way to ease myself.
I am, indeed, almost ashamed to tell you; but necessity put it in my
head.--You will think the matter too trifling to have been remembered,
and so it surely was; nor should I have remembered it on any other
occasion. You must know then, sir, that my brother was always my
inveterate enemy and altogether as fond of my sister.--He once prevailed
with my father to let him take my sister with him in the chariot, and
by that means I was disappointed of going to a ball which I had set my
heart on. The disappointment, I assure you, was great at the time; but I
had long since forgotten it. I must have been a very bad woman if I had
not, for it was the only thing in which I can remember that my father
ever disobliged me. However, I now revived this in my mind, which I
artificially worked up into so high an injury, that I assure you it
afforded me no little comfort. When any tender idea intruded into my
bosom, I immediately raised this fantom of an injury in my imagination,
and it considerably lessened the fury of that sorrow which I should have
otherwise felt for the loss of so good a father, who died within a few
months of my departure from him.

"And now, sir, to draw to a conclusion. One night, as I was in the
gallery at Drury-lane playhouse, I saw below me in a side-box (she
was once below me in every place), that widow whom I mentioned to you
before. I had scarce cast my eyes on this woman before I was so shocked
with the sight that it almost deprived me of my senses; for the villain
Hebbers came presently in and seated himself behind her.

"He had been almost a month from me, and I believed him to be at his
quarters in Yorkshire. Guess what were my sensations when I beheld
him sitting by that base woman, and talking to her with the utmost
familiarity. I could not long endure this sight, and having acquainted
my companion that I was taken suddenly ill, I forced her to go home with
me at the end of the second act.

"After a restless and sleepless night, when I rose the next morning I
had the comfort to receive a visit from the woman of the house, who,
after a very short introduction, asked me when I had heard from the
captain, and when I expected to see him? I had not strength or spirits
to make her any answer, and she proceeded thus:--'Indeed I did not think
the captain would have used me so. My husband was an officer of the army
as well as himself; and if a body is a little low in the world, I am
sure that is no reason for folks to trample on a body. I defy the world
to say as I ever was guilty of an ill thing.' For heaven's sake, madam,
says I, what do you mean? 'Mean?' cries she; 'I am sure, if I had not
thought you had been Captain Hebbers' lady, his lawful lady too, you
should never have set footing in my house. I would have Captain Hebbers
know, that though I am reduced to let lodgings, I never have entertained
any but persons of character.'--In this manner, sir, she ran on, saying
many shocking things not worth repeating, till my anger at last got the
better of my patience as well as my sorrow, and I pushed her out of the
room.

"She had not been long gone before her daughter came to me, and, after
many expressions of tenderness and pity, acquainted me that her mother
had just found out, by means of the captain's servant, that the captain
was married to another lady; 'which, if you did not know before, madam,'
said she, 'I am sorry to be the messenger of such ill news.'

"Think, Mr. Booth, what I must have endured to see myself humbled before
such a creature as this, the daughter of a woman who lets lodgings!
However, having recollected myself a little, I thought it would be in
vain to deny anything; so, knowing this to be one of the best-natured
and most sensible girls in the world, I resolved to tell her my whole
story, and for the future to make her my confidante. I answered her,
therefore, with a good deal of assurance, that she need not regret
telling me this piece of ill news, for I had known it before I came to
her house.

"'Pardon me, madam,' replied the girl, 'you cannot possibly have known
it so long, for he hath not been married above a week; last night was
the first time of his appearing in public with his wife at the play.
Indeed, I knew very well the cause of your uneasiness there; but would
not mention---'

"His wife at the play? answered I eagerly. What wife? whom do you mean?

"'I mean the widow Carey, madam,' replied she, 'to whom the captain was
married a few days since. His servant was here last night to pay for
your lodging, and he told it my mother.'

"I know not what answer I made, or whether I made any. I presently fell
dead on the floor, and it was with great difficulty I was brought back
to life by the poor girl, for neither the mother nor the maid of the
house would lend me any assistance, both seeming to regard me rather as
a monster than a woman.

"Scarce had I recovered the use of my senses when I received a letter
from the villain, declaring he had not assurance to see my face, and
very kindly advising me to endeavour to reconcile myself to my family,
concluding with an offer, in case I did not succeed, to allow me twenty
pounds a-year to support me in some remote part of the kingdom.

"I need not mention my indignation at these proposals. In the highest
agony of rage, I went in a chair to the detested house, where I easily
got access to the wretch I had devoted to destruction, whom I no sooner
found within my reach than I plunged a drawn penknife, which I had
prepared in my pocket for the purpose, into his accursed heart. For this
fact I was immediately seized and soon after committed hither; and
for this fact I am ready to die, and shall with pleasure receive the
sentence of the law.

"Thus, sir," said she, "I have related to you my unhappy story, and if
I have tired your patience, by dwelling too long on those parts which
affected me the most, I ask your pardon."

Booth made a proper speech on this occasion, and, having exprest much
concern at her present situation, concluded that he hoped her sentence
would be milder than she seemed to expect.

Her reply to this was full of so much bitterness and indignation, that
we do not think proper to record the speech at length, in which having
vented her passion, she all at once put on a serene countenance, and
with an air of great complacency said, "Well, Mr. Booth, I think I have
now a right to satisfy my curiosity at the expense of your breath. I
may say it is not altogether a vain curiosity, for perhaps I have had
inclination enough to interest myself in whatever concerns you; but no
matter for that: those days (added she with a sigh) are now over."

Booth, who was extremely good-natured and well-bred, told her that she
should not command him twice whatever was in his power; and then, after
the usual apology, was going to begin his history, when the keeper
arrived, and acquainted the lady that dinner was ready, at the same time
saying, "I suppose, madam, as the gentleman is an acquaintance of yours,
he must dine with us too."

Miss Matthews told the keeper that she had only one word to mention in
private to the gentleman, and that then they would both attend him. She
then pulled her purse from her pocket, in which were upwards of twenty
guineas, being the remainder of the money for which she had sold a gold
repeating watch, her father's present, with some other trinkets, and
desired Mr. Booth to take what he should have occasion for, saying, "You
know, I believe, dear Will, I never valued money; and now I am sure
I shall have very little use for it." Booth, with much difficulty,
accepted of two guineas, and then they both together attended the
keeper.




Chapter x

_Table-talk, consisting of a facetious discourse that passed in the
prison_.


There were assembled at the table the governor of these (not improperly
called infernal) regions; the lieutenant-governor, vulgarly named the
first turnkey; Miss Matthews, Mr. Booth, Mr. Robinson the gambler,
several other prisoners of both sexes, and one Murphy, an attorney.

The governor took the first opportunity to bring the affair of Miss
Matthews upon the carpet, and then, turning to Murphy, he said, "It is
very lucky this gentleman happens to be present; I do assure you, madam,
your cause cannot be in abler hands. He is, I believe, the best man in
England at a defence; I have known him often succeed against the most
positive evidence."

"Fy, sir," answered Murphy; "you know I hate all this; but, if the lady
will trust me with her cause, I will do the best in my power. Come,
madam, do not be discouraged; a bit of manslaughter and cold iron, I
hope, will be the worst: or perhaps we may come off better with a slice
of chance-medley, or _se defendendo_"

"I am very ignorant of the law, sir," cries the lady.

"Yes, madam," answered Murphy; "it can't be expected you should
understand it. There are very few of us who profess it that understand
the whole, nor is it necessary we should. There is a great deal of
rubbish of little use, about indictments, and abatements, and bars, and
ejectments, and trovers, and such stuff, with which people cram their
heads to little purpose. The chapter of evidence is the main business;
that is the sheet-anchor; that is the rudder, which brings the vessel
safe _in portum_. Evidence is, indeed, the whole, the _summa totidis_,
for _de non apparentibus et non insistentibus eandem est ratio_."

"If you address yourself to me, sir," said the lady, "you are much too
learned, I assure you, for my understanding."

"_Tace_, madam," answered Murphy, "is Latin for a candle: I commend your
prudence. I shall know the particulars of your case when we are alone."

"I hope the lady," said Robinson, "hath no suspicion of any person here.
I hope we are all persons of honour at this table."

"D--n my eyes!" answered a well-dressed woman, "I can answer for myself
and the other ladies; though I never saw the lady in my life, she need
not be shy of us, d--n my eyes! I scorn to rap [Footnote: A cant word,
meaning to swear, or rather to perjure yourself] against any lady."

"D--n me, madam!" cried another female, "I honour what you have done. I
once put a knife into a cull myself--so my service to you, madam, and I
wish you may come off with _se diffidendo_ with all my heart."

"I beg, good woman," said Miss Matthews, "you would talk on some other
subject, and give yourself no concern about my affairs."

"You see, ladies," cried Murphy, "the gentle-woman doth not care to talk
on this matter before company; so pray do not press her."

"Nay, I value the lady's acquaintance no more than she values mine,"
cries the first woman who spoke. "I have kept as good company as the
lady, I believe, every day in the week. Good woman! I don't use to be
so treated. If the lady says such another word to me, d--n me, I will
darken her daylights. Marry, come up! Good woman!--the lady's a whore as
well as myself! and, though I am sent hither to mill doll, d--n my eyes,
I have money enough to buy it off as well as the lady herself."

Action might perhaps soon have ensued this speech, had not the keeper
interposed his authority, and put an end to any further dispute. Soon
after which, the company broke up, and none but himself, Mr. Murphy,
Captain Booth, and Miss Matthews, remained together.

Miss Matthews then, at the entreaty of the keeper, began to open her
case to Mr. Murphy, whom she admitted to be her solicitor, though she
still declared she was indifferent as to the event of the trial.

Mr. Murphy, having heard all the particulars with which the reader is
already acquainted (as far as related to the murder), shook his head and
said, "There is but one circumstance, madam, which I wish was out of the
case; and that we must put out of it; I mean the carrying the penknife
drawn into the room with you; for that seems to imply malice prepensive,
as we call it in the law: this circumstance, therefore, must not appear
against you; and, if the servant who was in the room observed this,
he must be bought off at all hazards. All here you say are friends;
therefore I tell you openly, you must furnish me with money sufficient
for this purpose. Malice is all we have to guard against."

"I would not presume, sir," cries Booth, "to inform you in the law;
but I have heard, in case of stabbing, a man may be indicted upon the
statute; and it is capital, though no malice appears."

"You say true, sir," answered Murphy; "a man may be indicted _contra
formam statutis;_ and that method, I allow you, requires no malice. I
presume you are a lawyer, sir?"

"No, indeed, sir," answered Booth, "I know nothing of the law."

"Then, sir, I will tell you--If a man be indicted _contra formam
tatutis_, as we say, no malice is necessary, because the form of the
statute makes malice; and then what we have to guard against is having
struck the first blow. Pox on't, it is unlucky this was done in a room:
if it had been in the street we could have had five or six witnesses to
have proved the first blow, cheaper than, I am afraid, we shall get this
one; for when a man knows, from the unhappy circumstances of the case,
that you can procure no other witness but himself, he is always dear. It
is so in all other ways of business. I am very implicit, you see; but we
are all among friends. The safest way is to furnish me with money enough
to offer him a good round sum at once; and I think (it is for your good
I speak) fifty pounds is the least than can be offered him. I do assure
you I would offer him no less was it my own case."

"And do you think, sir," said she, "that I would save my life at the
expense of hiring another to perjure himself?"

"Ay, surely do I," cries Murphy; "for where is the fault, admitting
there is some fault in perjury, as you call it? and, to be sure, it is
such a matter as every man would rather wish to avoid than not: and yet,
as it may be managed, there is not so much as some people are apt to
imagine in it; for he need not kiss the book, and then pray where's
the perjury? but if the crier is sharper than ordinary, what is it he
kisses? is it anything but a bit of calf's-skin? I am sure a man must
be a very bad Christian himself who would not do so much as that to
save the life of any Christian whatever, much more of so pretty a lady.
Indeed, madam, if we can make out but a tolerable case, so much beauty
will go a great way with the judge and the jury too."

The latter part of this speech, notwithstanding the mouth it came from,
caused Miss Matthews to suppress much of the indignation which began
to arise at the former; and she answered with a smile, "Sir, you are a
great casuist in these matters; but we need argue no longer concerning
them; for, if fifty pounds would save my life, I assure you I could not
command that sum. The little money I have in my pocket is all I can call
my own; and I apprehend, in the situation I am in, I shall have very
little of that to spare."

"Come, come, madam," cries Murphy, "life is sweet, let me tell you, and
never sweeter than when we are near losing it. I have known many a man
very brave and undaunted at his first commitment, who, when business
began to thicken a little upon him, hath changed his note. It is no time
to be saving in your condition."

The keeper, who, after the liberality of Miss Matthews, and on seeing
a purse of guineas in her hand, had conceived a great opinion of her
wealth, no sooner heard that the sum which he had in intention intirely
confiscated for his own use was attempted to be broke in upon, thought
it high time to be upon his guard. "To be sure," cries he, "Mr. Murphy,
life is sweet, as you say, that must be acknowledged; to be sure, life
is sweet; but, sweet as it is, no persons can advance more than they are
worth to save it. And indeed, if the lady can command no more money than
that little she mentions, she is to be commended for her unwillingness
to part with any of it; for, to be sure, as she says, she will want
every farthing of that to live like a gentlewoman till she comes to her
trial. And, to be sure, as sweet as life is, people ought to take care
to be able to live sweetly while they do live; besides, I cannot help
saying the lady shews herself to be what she is, by her abhorrence of
perjury, which is certainly a very dreadful crime. And, though the not
kissing the book doth, as you say, make a great deal of difference; and,
if a man had a great while to live and repent, perhaps he might swallow
it well enough; yet, when people comes to be near their end (as who can
venture to foretel what will be the lady's case?) they ought to take
care not to overburthen their conscience. I hope the lady's case
will not be found murder; for I am sure I always wish well to all my
prisoners who shew themselves to be gentlemen or gentlewomen; yet one
should always fear the worst."

"Indeed, sir, you speak like an oracle," answered the lady; "and one
subornation of perjury would sit heavier on my conscience than twenty
such murders as I am guilty of."

"Nay, to be sure, madam," answered the keeper, "nobody can pretend to
tell what provocation you must have had; and certainly it can never be
imagined that a lady who behaves herself so handsomely as you have done
ever since you have been under my keys should be guilty of killing a man
without being very highly provoked to do it."

Mr. Murphy was, I believe, going to answer when he was called out of
the room; after which nothing passed between the remaining persons worth
relating, till Booth and the lady retired back again into the lady's
apartment.

Here they fell immediately to commenting on the foregoing discourse;
but, as their comments were, I believe, the same with what most readers
have made on the same occasion, we shall omit them. At last, Miss
Matthews reminding her companion of his promise of relating to her what
had befallen him since the interruption of their former acquaintance, he
began as is written in the next book of this history.




BOOK II.



Chapter i.

_In which Captain Booth begins to relate his history._


The tea-table being removed, and Mr. Booth and the lady left alone, he
proceeded as follows:

"Since you desire, madam, to know the particulars of my courtship
to that best and dearest of women whom I afterwards married, I will
endeavour to recollect them as well as I can, at least all those
incidents which are most worth relating to you.

"If the vulgar opinion of the fatality in marriage had ever any
foundation, it surely appeared in my marriage with my Amelia. I knew her
in the first dawn of her beauty; and, I believe, madam, she had as much
as ever fell to the share of a woman; but, though I always admired her,
it was long without any spark of love. Perhaps the general admiration
which at that time pursued her, the respect paid her by persons of the
highest rank, and the numberless addresses which were made her by men of
great fortune, prevented my aspiring at the possession of those charms
which seemed so absolutely out of my reach. However it was, I assure
you the accident which deprived her of the admiration of others made the
first great impression on my heart in her favour. The injury done to
her beauty by the overturning of a chaise, by which, as you may well
remember, her lovely nose was beat all to pieces, gave me an assurance
that the woman who had been so much adored for the charms of her person
deserved a much higher adoration to be paid to her mind; for that she
was in the latter respect infinitely more superior to the rest of her
sex than she had ever been in the former."

"I admire your taste extremely," cried the lady; "I remember perfectly
well the great heroism with which your Amelia bore that misfortune."

"Good heavens! madam," answered he; "what a magnanimity of mind did her
behaviour demonstrate! If the world have extolled the firmness of soul
in a man who can support the loss of fortune; of a general who can be
composed after the loss of a victory; or of a king who can be contented
with the loss of a crown; with what astonishment ought we to behold,
with what praises to honour, a young lady, who can with patience and
resignation submit to the loss of exquisite beauty, in other words to
the loss of fortune, power, glory, everything which human nature is
apt to court and rejoice in! what must be the mind which can bear to
be deprived of all these in a moment, and by an unfortunate trifling
accident; which could support all this, together with the most
exquisite torments of body, and with dignity, with resignation, without
complaining, almost without a tear, undergo the most painful and
dreadful operations of surgery in such a situation!" Here he stopt, and
a torrent of tears gushed from his eyes; such tears are apt to flow from
a truly noble heart at the hearing of anything surprisingly great and
glorious. As soon as he was able he again proceeprehension of danger gives not the least concern to a sailor,
to whom rocks and quicksands are almost the only objects of terror.

"The master, however, was a little mistaken in the present instance; for
he had not left the cabbin above an hour before my man came running to
me, and acquainted me that the ship was half full of water; that the
sailors were going to hoist out the boat and save themselves, and begged
me to come that moment along with him, as I tendered my preservation.
With this account, which was conveyed to me in a whisper, I acquainted
both the captain and ensign; and we all together immediately mounted
the deck, where we found the master making use of all his oratory to
persuade the sailors that the ship was in no danger; and at the same
time employing all his authority to set the pumps a-going, which he
assured them would keep the water under, and save his dear Lovely Peggy
(for that was the name of the ship), which he swore he loved as dearly
as his own soul.

"Indeed this sufficiently appeared; for the leak was so great, and the
water flowed in so plentifully, that his Lovely Peggy was half filled
before he could be brought to think of quitting her; but now the boat
was brought alongside the ship, and the master himself, notwithstanding
all his love for her, quitted his ship, and leapt into the boat. Every
man present attempted to follow his example, when I heard the voice of
my servant roaring forth my name in a kind of agony. I made directly to
the ship-side, but was too late; for the boat, being already overladen,
put directly off. And now, madam, I am going to relate to you an
instance of heroic affection in a poor fellow towards his master, to
which love itself, even among persons of superior education, can produce
but few similar instances. My poor man, being unable to get me with him
into the boat, leapt suddenly into the sea, and swam back to the ship;
and, when I gently rebuked him for his rashness, he answered, he chose
rather to die with me than to live to carry the account of my death to
my Amelia: at the same time bursting into a flood of tears, he cried,
'Good Heavens! what will that poor lady feel when she hears of this!'
This tender concern for my dear love endeared the poor fellow more to
me than the gallant instance which he had just before given of his
affection towards myself.

"And now, madam, my eyes were shocked with a sight, the horror of which
can scarce be imagined; for the boat had scarce got four hundred yards
from the ship when it was swallowed up by the merciless waves, which now
ran so high, that out of the number of persons which were in the boat
none recovered the ship, though many of them we saw miserably perish
before our eyes, some of them very near us, without any possibility of
giving them the least assistance.

"But, whatever we felt for them, we felt, I believe, more for ourselves,
expecting every minute when we should share the same fate. Amongst the
rest, one of our officers appeared quite stupified with fear. I never,
indeed, saw a more miserable example of the great power of that passion:
I must not, however, omit doing him justice, by saying that I afterwards
saw the same man behave well in an engagement, in which he was wounded;
though there likewise he was said to have betrayed the same passion of
fear in his countenance.

"The other of our officers was no less stupified (if I may so express
myself) with fool-hardiness, and seemed almost insensible of his danger.
To say the truth, I have, from this and some other instances which I
have seen, been almost inclined to think that the courage as well as
cowardice of fools proceeds from not knowing what is or what is not the
proper object of fear; indeed, we may account for the extreme hardiness
of some men in the same manner as for the terrors of children at a
bugbear. The child knows not but that the bugbear is the proper object
of fear, the blockhead knows not that a cannon-ball is so.

"As to the remaining part of the ship's crew and the soldiery, most of
them were dead drunk, and the rest were endeavouring, as fast as they
could, to prepare for death in the same manner.

"In this dreadful situation we were taught that no human condition
should inspire men with absolute despair; for, as the storm had ceased
for some time, the swelling of the sea began considerably to abate; and
we now perceived the man of war which convoyed us, at no great distance
astern. Those aboard her easily perceived our distress, and made
towards us. When they came pretty near they hoisted out two boats to
our assistance. These no sooner approached the ship than they were
instantaneously filled, and I myself got a place in one of them,
chiefly by the aid of my honest servant, of whose fidelity to me on all
occasions I cannot speak or think too highly. Indeed, I got into the
boat so much the more easily, as a great number on board the ship were
rendered, by drink, incapable of taking any care for themselves. There
was time, however, for the boat to pass and repass; so that, when we
came to call over names, three only, of all that remained in the ship
after the loss of her own boat, were missing.

"The captain, ensign, and myself, were received with many
congratulations by our officers on board the man of war.--The
sea-officers too, all except the captain, paid us their compliments,
though these were of the rougher kind, and not without several jokes on
our escape. As for the captain himself, we scarce saw him during many
hours; and, when he appeared, he presented a view of majesty beyond any
that I had ever seen. The dignity which he preserved did indeed give
me rather the idea of a Mogul, or a Turkish emperor, than of any of the
monarchs of Christendom. To say the truth, I could resemble his walk on
the deck to nothing but the image of Captain Gulliver strutting among
the Lilliputians; he seemed to think himself a being of an order
superior to all around him, and more especially to us of the land
service. Nay, such was the behaviour of all the sea-officers and sailors
to us and our soldiers, that, instead of appearing to be subjects of the
same prince, engaged in one quarrel, and joined to support one cause, we
land-men rather seemed to be captives on board an enemy's vessel. This
is a grievous misfortune, and often proves so fatal to the service, that
it is great pity some means could not be found of curing it."

Here Mr. Booth stopt a while to take breath. We will therefore give the
same refreshment to the reader.




Chapter v.

_The arrival of Booth at Gibraltar, with what there befel him._


"The adventures," continued Booth, "which I happened to me from this day
till my arrival at Gibraltar are not worth recounting to you. After a
voyage the remainder of which was tolerably prosperous, we arrived in
that garrison, the natural strength of which is so well known to the
whole world.

"About a week after my arrival it was my fortune to be ordered on a
sally party, in which my left leg was broke with a musket-ball; and I
should most certainly have either perished miserably, or must have
owed my preservation to some of the enemy, had not my faithful servant
carried me off on his shoulders, and afterwards, with the assistance of
one of his comrades, brought me back into the garrison.

"The agony of my wound was so great, that it threw me into a fever, from
whence my surgeon apprehended much danger. I now began again to feel for
my Amelia, and for myself on her account; and the disorder of my mind,
occasioned by such melancholy contemplations, very highly aggravated the
distemper of my body; insomuch that it would probably have proved fatal,
had it not been for the friendship of one Captain James, an officer of
our regiment, and an old acquaintance, who is undoubtedly one of the
pleasantest companions and one of the best-natured men in the world.
This worthy man, who had a head and a heart perfectly adequate to every
office of friendship, stayed with me almost day and night during my
illness; and by strengthening my hopes, raising my spirits, and cheering
my thoughts, preserved me from destruction.

"The behaviour of this man alone is a sufficient proof of the truth
of my doctrine, that all men act entirely from their passions; for
Bob James can never be supposed to act from any motives of virtue
or religion, since he constantly laughs at both; and yet his conduct
towards me alone demonstrates a degree of goodness which, perhaps, few
of the votaries of either virtue or religion can equal." "You need not
take much pains," answered Miss Matthews, with a smile, "to convince me
of your doctrine. I have been always an advocate for the same. I look
upon the two words you mention to serve only as cloaks, under which
hypocrisy may be the better enabled to cheat the world. I have been of
that opinion ever since I read that charming fellow Mandevil."

"Pardon me, madam," answered Booth; "I hope you do not agree with
Mandevil neither, who hath represented human nature in a picture of the
highest deformity. He hath left out of his system the best passion which
the mind can possess, and attempts to derive the effects or energies of
that passion from the base impulses of pride or fear. Whereas it is as
certain that love exists in the mind of man as that its opposite hatred
doth; and the same reasons will equally prove the existence of the one
as the existence of the other."

"I don't know, indeed," replied the lady, "I never thought much about
the matter. This I know, that when I read Mandevil I thought all he said
was true; and I have been often told that he proves religion and virtue
to be only mere names. However, if he denies there is any such thing as
love, that is most certainly wrong.--I am afraid I can give him the lye
myself."

"I will join with you, madam, in that," answered Booth, "at any time."

"Will you join with me?" answered she, looking eagerly at him--"O, Mr.
Booth! I know not what I was going to say--What--Where did you leave
off?--I would not interrupt you--but I am impatient to know something."

"What, madam?" cries Booth; "if I can give you any satisfaction--"

"No, no," said she, "I must hear all; I would not for the world break
the thread of your story. Besides, I am afraid to ask--Pray, pray, sir,
go on."

"Well, madam," cries Booth, "I think I was mentioning the extraordinary
acts of friendship done me by Captain James; nor can I help taking
notice of the almost unparalleled fidelity of poor Atkinson (for that
was my man's name), who was not only constant in the assiduity of his
attendance, but during the time of my danger demonstrated a concern for
me which I can hardly account for, as my prevailing on his captain to
make him a sergeant was the first favour he ever received at my hands,
and this did not happen till I was almost perfectly recovered of my
broken leg. Poor fellow! I shall never forget the extravagant joy his
halbert gave him; I remember it the more because it was one of the
happiest days of my own life; for it was upon this day that I received
a letter from my dear Amelia, after a long silence, acquainting me that
she was out of all danger from her lying-in.

"I was now once more able to perform my duty; when (so unkind was the
fortune of war), the second time I mounted the guard, I received a
violent contusion from the bursting of a bomb. I was felled to the
ground, where I lay breathless by the blow, till honest Atkinson came to
my assistance, and conveyed me to my room, where a surgeon immediately
attended me.

"The injury I had now received was much more dangerous in my surgeon's
opinion than the former; it caused me to spit blood, and was attended
with a fever, and other bad symptoms; so that very fatal consequences
were apprehended.

"In this situation, the image of my Amelia haunted me day and night; and
the apprehensions of never seeing her more were so intolerable, that I
had thoughts of resigning my commission, and returning home, weak as I
was, that I might have, at least, the satisfaction of dying in the arms
of my love. Captain James, however, persisted in dissuading me from any
such resolution. He told me my honour was too much concerned, attempted
to raise my hopes of recovery to the utmost of his power; but chiefly
he prevailed on me by suggesting that, if the worst which I apprehended
should happen, it was much better for Amelia that she should be absent
than present in so melancholy an hour. 'I know' cried he, 'the extreme
joy which must arise in you from meeting again with Amelia, and the
comfort of expiring in her arms; but consider what she herself must
endure upon the dreadful occasion, and you would not wish to purchase
any happiness at the price of so much pain to her.' This argument at
length prevailed on me; and it was after many long debates resolved,
that she should not even know my present condition, till my doom either
for life or death was absolutely fixed."

"Oh! Heavens! how great! how generous!" cried Miss Matthews. "Booth,
thou art a noble fellow; and I scarce think there is a woman upon earth
worthy so exalted a passion."

Booth made a modest answer to the compliment which Miss Matthews had
paid him. This drew more civilities from the lady, and these again
more acknowledgments; all which we shall pass by, and proceed with our
history.




Chapter vi.

_Containing matters which will please some readers._


"Two months and more had I continued in a state of incertainty,
sometimes with more flattering, and sometimes with more alarming
symptoms; when one afternoon poor Atkinson came running into my room,
all pale and out of breath, and begged me not to be surprized at his
news. I asked him eagerly what was the matter, and if it was anything
concerning Amelia? I had scarce uttered the dear name when she herself
rushed into the room, and ran hastily to me, crying, 'Yes, it is, it is
your Amelia herself.'

"There is nothing so difficult to describe, and generally so dull when
described, as scenes of excessive tenderness."

"Can you think so?" says Miss Matthews; "surely there is nothing so
charming!--Oh! Mr. Booth, our sex is d--ned by the want of tenderness in
yours. O, were they all like you--certainly no man was ever your equal."

"Indeed, madam," cries Booth, "you honour me too much. But--well--when
the first transports of our meeting were over, Amelia began gently to
chide me for having concealed my illness from her; for, in three letters
which I had writ her since the accident had happened, there was not
the least mention of it, or any hint given by which she could possibly
conclude I was otherwise than in perfect health. And when I had excused
myself, by assigning the true reason, she cried--'O Mr. Booth! and do
you know so little of your Amelia as to think I could or would survive
you? Would it not be better for one dreadful sight to break my heart all
at once than to break it by degrees?--O Billy! can anything pay me for
the loss of this embrace?'---But I ask your pardon--how ridiculous doth
my fondness appear in your eyes!"

"How often," answered she, "shall I assert the contrary? What would you
have me say, Mr. Booth? Shall I tell you I envy Mrs. Booth of all the
women in the world? would you believe me if I did? I hope you--what am I
saying? Pray make no farther apology, but go on."

"After a scene," continued he, "too tender to be conceived by many,
Amelia informed me that she had received a letter from an unknown
hand, acquainting her with my misfortune, and advising her, if she ever
desired to see me more, to come directly to Gibraltar. She said she
should not have delayed a moment after receiving this letter, had not
the same ship brought her one from me written with rather more than
usual gaiety, and in which there was not the least mention of my
indisposition. This, she said, greatly puzzled her and her mother,
and the worthy divine endeavoured to persuade her to give credit to my
letter, and to impute the other to a species of wit with which the
world greatly abounds. This consists entirely in doing various kinds
of mischief to our fellow-creatures, by belying one, deceiving another,
exposing a third, and drawing in a fourth, to expose himself; in short,
by making some the objects of laughter, others of contempt; and indeed
not seldom by subjecting them to very great inconveniences, perhaps to
ruin, for the sake of a jest.

"Mrs. Harris and the doctor derived the letter from this species of wit.
Miss Betty, however, was of a different opinion, and advised poor Amelia
to apply to an officer whom the governor had sent over in the same ship,
by whom the report of my illness was so strongly confirmed, that Amelia
immediately resolved on her voyage.

"I had a great curiosity to know the author of this letter, but not the
least trace of it could be discovered. The only person with whom I lived
in any great intimacy was Captain James, and he, madam, from what I have
already told you, you will think to be the last person I could suspect;
besides, he declared upon his honour that he knew nothing of the matter,
and no man's honour is, I believe, more sacred. There was indeed an
ensign of another regiment who knew my wife, and who had sometimes
visited me in my illness; but he was a very unlikely man to interest
himself much in any affairs which did not concern him; and he too
declared he knew nothing of it."

"And did you never discover this secret?" cried Miss Matthews.

"Never to this day," answered Booth.

"I fancy," said she, "I could give a shrewd guess. What so likely as
that Mrs. Booth, when you left her, should have given her foster-brother
orders to send her word of whatever befel you? Yet stay--that could not
be neither; for then she would not have doubted whether she should leave
dear England on the receipt of the letter. No, it must have been by some
other means;--yet that I own appeared extremely natural to me; for if I
had been left by such a husband I think I should have pursued the same
method."

"No, madam," cried Booth, "it must have been conveyed by some other
channel; for my Amelia, I am certain, was entirely ignorant of the
manner; and as for poor Atkinson, I am convinced he would not have
ventured to take such a step without acquainting me. Besides, the poor
fellow had, I believe, such a regard for my wife, out of gratitude for
the favours she hath done his mother, that I make no doubt he was highly
rejoiced at her absence from my melancholy scene. Well, whoever writ it
is a matter very immaterial; yet, as it seemed so odd and unaccountable
an incident, I could not help mentioning it.

"From the time of Amelia's arrival nothing remarkable happened till my
perfect recovery, unless I should observe her remarkable behaviour, so
full of care and tenderness, that it was perhaps without a parallel."

"O no, Mr. Booth," cries the lady; "it is fully equalled, I am sure,
by your gratitude. There is nothing, I believe, so rare as gratitude in
your sex, especially in husbands. So kind a remembrance is, indeed, more
than a return to such an obligation; for where is the mighty obligation
which a woman confers, who being possessed of an inestimable jewel, is
so kind to herself as to be careful and tender of it? I do not say this
to lessen your opinion of Mrs. Booth. I have no doubt but that she loves
you as well as she is capable. But I would not have you think so meanly
of our sex as to imagine there are not a thousand women susceptible of
true tenderness towards a meritorious man. Believe me, Mr. Booth, if I
had received such an account of an accident having happened to such a
husband, a mother and a parson would not have held me a moment. I should
have leapt into the first fishing-boat I could have found, and bid
defiance to the winds and waves.--Oh! there is no true tenderness but in
a woman of spirit. I would not be understood all this while to reflect
on Mrs. Booth. I am only defending the cause of my sex; for, upon
my soul, such compliments to a wife are a satire on all the rest of
womankind."

"Sure you jest, Miss Matthews," answered Booth with a smile; "however,
if you please, I will proceed in my story."




Chapter vii.

_The captain, continuing his story, recounts some particulars which, we
doubt not, to many good people, will appear unnatural._


I was scarce sooner recovered from my indisposition than Amelia herself
fell ill. This, I am afraid, was occasioned by the fatigues which I
could not prevent her from undergoing on my account; for, as my disease
went off with violent sweats, during which the surgeon strictly ordered
that I should lie by myself, my Amelia could not be prevailed upon
to spend many hours in her own bed. During my restless fits she would
sometimes read to me several hours together; indeed it was not without
difficulty that she ever quitted my bedside. These fatigues, added to
the uneasiness of her mind, overpowered her weak spirits, and threw
her into one of the worst disorders that can possibly attend a woman;
a disorder very common among the ladies, and our physicians have not
agreed upon its name. Some call it fever on the spirits, some a nervous
fever, some the vapours, and some the hysterics.

"O say no more," cries Miss Matthews; "I pity you, I pity you from my
soul. A man had better be plagued with all the curses of Egypt than with
a vapourish wife."

"Pity me! madam," answered Booth; "pity rather that dear creature who,
from her love and care of my unworthy self, contracted a distemper, the
horrors of which are scarce to be imagined. It is, indeed, a sort of
complication of all diseases together, with almost madness added to
them. In this situation, the siege being at an end, the governor gave me
leave to attend my wife to Montpelier, the air of which was judged to
be most likely to restore her to health. Upon this occasion she wrote
to her mother to desire a remittance, and set forth the melancholy
condition of her health, and her necessity for money, in such terms as
would have touched any bosom not void of humanity, though a stranger
to the unhappy sufferer. Her sister answered it, and I believe I have a
copy of the answer in my pocket. I keep it by me as a curiosity, and
you would think it more so could I shew you my Amelia's letter." He then
searched his pocket-book, and finding the letter among many others, he
read it in the following words:

"'DEAR SISTER,--My mamma being much disordered, hath commanded me
to tell you she is both shocked and surprized at your extraordinary
request, or, as she chuses to call it, order for money. You know, my
dear, she says that your marriage with this red-coat man was entirely
against her consent and the opinion of all your family (I am sure I may
here include myself in that number); and yet, after this fatal act of
disobedience, she was prevailed on to receive you as her child; not,
however, nor are you so to understand it, as the favourite which you was
before. She forgave you; but this was as a Christian and a parent; still
preserving in her own mind a just sense of your disobedience, and a just
resentment on that account. And yet, notwithstanding this resentment,
she desires you to remember that, when you a second time ventured to
oppose her authority, and nothing would serve you but taking a ramble
(an indecent one, I can't help saying) after your fellow, she thought
fit to shew the excess of a mother's tenderness, and furnished you with
no less than fifty pounds for your foolish voyage. How can she, then, be
otherwise than surprized at your present demand? which, should she be
so weak to comply with, she must expect to be every month repeated, in
order to supply the extravagance of a young rakish officer. You say
she will compassionate your sufferings; yes, surely she doth greatly
compassionate them, and so do I too, though you was neither so kind nor
so civil as to suppose I should. But I forgive all your slights to me,
as well now as formerly. Nay, I not only forgive, but I pray daily
for you. But, dear sister, what could you expect less than what hath
happened? you should have believed your friends, who were wiser and
older than you. I do not here mean myself, though I own I am eleven
months and some odd weeks your superior; though, had I been younger, I
might, perhaps, have been able to advise you; for wisdom and what some
may call beauty do not always go together. You will not be offended at
this; for I know in your heart, you have always held your head above
some people, whom, perhaps, other people have thought better of; but why
do I mention what I scorn so much? No, my dear sister, Heaven forbid it
should ever be said of me that I value myself upon my face--not but if I
could believe men perhaps--but I hate and despise men--you know I do, my
dear, and I wish you had despised them as much; but _jacta est jalea_,
as the doctor says. You are to make the best of your fortune--what
fortune, I mean, my mamma may please to give you, for you know all is
in her power. Let me advise you, then, to bring your mind to your
circumstances, and remember (for I can't help writing it, as it is
for your own good) the vapours are a distemper which very ill become a
knapsack. Remember, my dear, what you have done; remember what my mamma
hath done; remember we have something of yours to keep, and do not
consider yourself as an only child; no, nor as a favourite child; but be
pleased to remember, Dear sister, Your most affectionate sister,

"'and most obedient humble servant,

"'E. HARRIS.'"

"O brave Miss Betty!" cried Miss Matthews; "I always held her in high
esteem; but I protest she exceeds even what I could have expected from
her."

"This letter, madam," cries Booth, "you will believe, was an excellent
cordial for my poor wife's spirits. So dreadful indeed was the effect it
had upon her, that, as she had read it in my absence, I found her, at
my return home, in the most violent fits; and so long was it before
she recovered her senses, that I despaired of that blest event ever
happening; and my own senses very narrowly escaped from being sacrificed
to my despair. However, she came at last to herself, and I began to
consider of every means of carrying her immediately to Montpelier, which
was now become much more necessary than before.

"Though I was greatly shocked at the barbarity of the letter, yet I
apprehended no very ill consequence from it; for, as it was believed all
over the army that I had married a great fortune, I had received offers
of money, if I wanted it, from more than one. Indeed, I might have
easily carried my wife to Montpelier at any time; but she was extremely
averse to the voyage, being desirous of our returning to England, as
I had leave to do; and she grew daily so much better, that, had it not
been for the receipt of that cursed--which I have just read to you, I
am persuaded she might have been able to return to England in the next
ship.

"Among others there was a colonel in the garrison who had not only
offered but importuned me to receive money of him; I now, therefore,
repaired to him; and, as a reason for altering my resolution, I produced
the letter, and, at the same time, acquainted him with the true state of
my affairs. The colonel read the letter, shook his head, and, after some
silence, said he was sorry I had refused to accept his offer before; but
that he had now so ordered matters, and disposed of his money, that he
had not a shilling left to spare from his own occasions.

"Answers of the same kind I had from several others, but not one penny
could I borrow of any; for I have been since firmly persuaded that
the honest colonel was not content with denying me himself, but took
effectual means, by spreading the secret I had so foolishly trusted him
with, to prevent me from succeeding elsewhere; for such is the nature of
men, that whoever denies himself to do you a favour is unwilling that it
should be done to you by any other.

"This was the first time I had ever felt that distress which arises from
the want of money; a distress very dreadful indeed in a married state;
for what can be more miserable than to see anything necessary to the
preservation of a beloved creature, and not be able to supply it?

"Perhaps you may wonder, madam, that I have not mentioned Captain James
on this occasion; but he was at that time laid up at Algiers (whither
he had been sent by the governor) in a fever. However, he returned time
enough to supply me, which he did with the utmost readiness on the very
first mention of my distress; and the good colonel, notwithstanding his
having disposed of his money, discounted the captain's draft. You see,
madam, an instance in the generous behaviour of my friend James, how
false are all universal satires against humankind. He is indeed one of
the worthiest men the world ever produced.

"But, perhaps, you will be more pleased still with the extravagant
generosity of my sergeant. The day before the return of Mr. James, the
poor fellow came to me with tears in his eyes, and begged I would not
be offended at what he was going to mention. He then pulled a purse
from his pocket, which contained, he said, the sum of twelve pounds,
and which he begged me to accept, crying, he was sorry it was not in his
power to lend me whatever I wanted. I was so struck with this instance
of generosity and friendship in such a person, that I gave him an
opportunity of pressing me a second time before I made him an answer.
Indeed, I was greatly surprised how he came to be worth that little sum,
and no less at his being acquainted with my own wants. In both which
points he presently satisfied me. As to the first, it seems he had
plundered a Spanish officer of fifteen pistoles; and as to the second,
he confessed he had it from my wife's maid, who had overheard some
discourse between her mistress and me. Indeed people, I believe, always
deceive themselves, who imagine they can conceal distrest circumstances
from their servants; for these are always extremely quicksighted on such
occasions."

"Good heavens!" cries Miss Matthews, "how astonishing is such behaviour
in so low a fellow!"

"I thought so myself," answered Booth; "and yet I know not, on a more
strict examination into the matter, why we should be more surprised to
see greatness of mind discover itself in one degree or rank of life than
in another. Love, benevolence, or what you will please to call it, may
be the reigning passion in a beggar as well as in a prince; and wherever
it is, its energies will be the same.

"To confess the truth, I am afraid we often compliment what we call
upper life, with too much injustice, at the expense of the lower. As it
is no rare thing to see instances which degrade human nature in persons
of the highest birth and education, so I apprehend that examples of
whatever is really great and good have been sometimes found amongst
those who have wanted all such advantages. In reality, palaces, I make
no doubt, do sometimes contain nothing but dreariness and darkness,
and the sun of righteousness hath shone forth with all its glory in a
cottage."




Chapter viii.

_The story of Booth continued._


"Mr. Booth thus went on:

"We now took leave of the garrison, and, having landed at Marseilles,
arrived at Montpelier, without anything happening to us worth
remembrance, except the extreme sea-sickness of poor Amelia; but I was
afterwards well repaid for the terrors which it occasioned me by the
good consequences which attended it; for I believe it contributed, even
more than the air of Montpelier, to the perfect re-establishment of her
health."

"I ask your pardon for interrupting you," cries Miss Matthews, "but you
never satisfied me whether you took the sergeant's money. You have made
me half in love with that charming fellow."

"How can you imagine, madam," answered Booth, "I should have taken from
a poor fellow what was of so little consequence to me, and at the same
time of so much to him? Perhaps, now, you will derive this from the
passion of pride."

"Indeed," says she, "I neither derive it from the passion of pride nor
from the passion of folly: but methinks you should have accepted the
offer, and I am convinced you hurt him very much when you refused it.
But pray proceed in your story." Then Booth went on as follows:

"As Amelia recovered her health and spirits daily, we began to pass our
time very pleasantly at Montpelier; for the greatest enemy to the French
will acknowledge that they are the best people in the world to live
amongst for a little while. In some countries it is almost as easy to
get a good estate as a good acquaintance. In England, particularly,
acquaintance is of almost as slow growth as an oak; so that the age of
man scarce suffices to bring it to any perfection, and families seldom
contract any great intimacy till the third, or at least the second
generation. So shy indeed are we English of letting a stranger into our
houses, that one would imagine we regarded all such as thieves. Now the
French are the very reverse. Being a stranger among them entitles you to
the better place, and to the greater degree of civility; and if you wear
but the appearance of a gentleman, they never suspect you are not one.
Their friendship indeed seldom extends as far as their purse; nor is
such friendship usual in other countries. To say the truth, politeness
carries friendship far enough in the ordinary occasions of life, and
those who want this accomplishment rarely make amends for it by their
sincerity; for bluntness, or rather rudeness, as it commonly deserves to
be called, is not always so much a mark of honesty as it is taken to be.

"The day after our arrival we became acquainted with Mons. Bagillard.
He was a Frenchman of great wit and vivacity, with a greater share of
learning than gentlemen are usually possessed of. As he lodged in the
same house with us, we were immediately acquainted, and I liked his
conversation so well that I never thought I had too much of his company.
Indeed, I spent so much of my time with him, that Amelia (I know not
whether I ought to mention it) grew uneasy at our familiarity, and
complained of my being too little with her, from my violent fondness for
my new acquaintance; for, our conversation turning chiefly upon
books, and principally Latin ones (for we read several of the classics
together), she could have but little entertainment by being with us.
When my wife had once taken it into her head that she was deprived of my
company by M. Bagillard, it was impossible to change her opinion; and,
though I now spent more of my time with her than I had ever done
before, she still grew more and more dissatisfied, till at last she very
earnestly desired me to quit my lodgings, and insisted upon it with more
vehemence than I had ever known her express before. To say the truth, if
that excellent woman could ever be thought unreasonable, I thought she
was so on this occasion.

"But in what light soever her desires appeared to me, as they manifestly
arose from an affection of which I had daily the most endearing proofs,
I resolved to comply with her, and accordingly removed to a distant part
of the town; for it is my opinion that we can have but little love for
the person whom we will never indulge in an unreasonable demand. Indeed,
I was under a difficulty with regard to Mons. Bagillard; for, as I
could not possibly communicate to him the true reason for quitting my
lodgings, so I found it as difficult to deceive him by a counterfeit
one; besides, I was apprehensive I should have little less of his
company than before. I could, indeed, have avoided this dilemma by
leaving Montpelier, for Amelia had perfectly recovered her health; but
I had faithfully promised Captain James to wait his return from Italy,
whither he was gone some time before from Gibraltar; nor was it proper
for Amelia to take any long journey, she being now near six months gone
with child.

"This difficulty, however, proved to be less than I had imagined it;
for my French friend, whether he suspected anything from my wife's
behaviour, though she never, as I observed, shewed him the least
incivility, became suddenly as cold on his side. After our leaving the
lodgings he never made above two or three formal visits; indeed his time
was soon after entirely taken up by an intrigue with a certain countess,
which blazed all over Montpelier.

"We had not been long in our new apartments before an English officer
arrived at Montpelier, and came to lodge in the same house with us. This
gentleman, whose name was Bath, was of the rank of a major, and had so
much singularity in his character, that, perhaps, you never heard of
any like him. He was far from having any of those bookish qualifications
which had before caused my Amelia's disquiet. It is true, his discourse
generally turned on matters of no feminine kind; war and martial
exploits being the ordinary topics of his conversation: however, as he
had a sister with whom Amelia was greatly pleased, an intimacy presently
grew between us, and we four lived in one family.

"The major was a great dealer in the marvellous, and was constantly the
little hero of his own tale. This made him very entertaining to
Amelia, who, of all the persons in the world, hath the truest taste and
enjoyment of the ridiculous; for, whilst no one sooner discovers it in
the character of another, no one so well conceals her knowledge of it
from the ridiculous person. I cannot help mentioning a sentiment of hers
on this head, as I think it doth her great honour. 'If I had the same
neglect,' said she, 'for ridiculous people with the generality of the
world, I should rather think them the objects of tears than laughter;
but, in reality, I have known several who, in some parts of their
characters, have been extremely ridiculous, in others have been
altogether as amiable. For instance,' said she, 'here is the major, who
tells us of many things which he has never seen, and of others which he
hath never done, and both in the most extravagant excess; and yet how
amiable is his behaviour to his poor sister, whom he hath not only
brought over hither for her health, at his own expence, but is come to
bear her company.' I believe, madam, I repeat her very words; for I am
very apt to remember what she says.

"You will easily believe, from a circumstance I have just mentioned in
the major's favour, especially when I have told you that his sister was
one of the best of girls, that it was entirely necessary to hide from
her all kind of laughter at any part of her brother's behaviour. To say
the truth, this was easy enough to do; for the poor girl was so blinded
with love and gratitude, and so highly honoured and reverenced her
brother, that she had not the least suspicion that there was a person in
the world capable of laughing at him.

"Indeed, I am certain she never made the least discovery of our
ridicule; for I am well convinced she would have resented it: for,
besides the love she bore her brother, she had a little family pride,
which would sometimes appear. To say the truth, if she had any fault,
it was that of vanity, but she was a very good girl upon the whole; and
none of us are entirely free from faults."

"You are a good-natured fellow, Will," answered Miss Matthews; "but
vanity is a fault of the first magnitude in a woman, and often the
occasion of many others."

To this Booth made no answer, but continued his story.

"In this company we passed two or three months very agreeably, till
the major and I both betook ourselves to our several nurseries; my wife
being brought to bed of a girl, and Miss Bath confined to her chamber by
a surfeit, which had like to have occasioned her death."

Here Miss Matthews burst into a loud laugh, of which when Booth asked
the reason, she said she could not forbear at the thoughts of two such
nurses.

"And did you really," says she, "make your wife's caudle yourself?"

"Indeed, madam," said he, "I did; and do you think that so
extraordinary?"

"Indeed I do," answered she; "I thought the best husbands had looked on
their wives' lying-in as a time of festival and jollity. What! did you
not even get drunk in the time of your wife's delivery? tell me honestly
how you employed yourself at this time."

"Why, then, honestly," replied he, "and in defiance of your laughter, I
lay behind her bolster, and supported her in my arms; and, upon my soul,
I believe I felt more pain in my mind than she underwent in her body.
And now answer me as honestly: Do you really think it a proper time of
mirth, when the creature one loves to distraction is undergoing the most
racking torments, as well as in the most imminent danger? and--but I
need not express any more tender circumstances."

"I am to answer honestly," cried she. "Yes, and sincerely," cries Booth.
"Why, then, honestly and sincerely," says she, "may I never see heaven
if I don't think you an angel of a man!"

"Nay, madam," answered Booth--"but, indeed, you do me too much honour;
there are many such husbands. Nay, have we not an example of the like
tenderness in the major? though as to him, I believe, I shall make you
laugh. While my wife lay-in, Miss Bath being extremely ill, I went one
day to the door of her apartment, to enquire after her health, as well
as for the major, whom I had not seen during a whole week. I knocked
softly at the door, and being bid to open it, I found the major in
his sister's ante-chamber warming her posset. His dress was certainly
whimsical enough, having on a woman's bedgown and a very dirty flannel
nightcap, which, being added to a very odd person (for he is a very
awkward thin man, near seven feet high), might have formed, in the
opinion of most men, a very proper object of laughter. The major started
from his seat at my entering into the room, and, with much emotion, and
a great oath, cried out, 'Is it you, sir?' I then enquired after his and
his sister's health. He answered, that his sister was better, and he was
very well, 'though I did not expect, sir,' cried he, with not a little
confusion, 'to be seen by you in this situation.' I told him I
thought it impossible he could appear in a situation more becoming his
character. 'You do not?' answered he. 'By G---- I am very much obliged
to you for that opinion; but, I believe, sir, however my weakness may
prevail on me to descend from it, no man can be more conscious of his
own dignity than myself.' His sister then called to him from the inner
room; upon which he rang the bell for her servant, and then, after a
stride or two across the room, he said, with an elated aspect, 'I
would not have you think, Mr. Booth, because you have caught me in
this deshabille, by coming upon me a little too abruptly--I cannot help
saying a little too abruptly--that I am my sister's nurse. I know better
what is due to the dignity of a man, and I have shewn it in a line of
battle. I think I have made a figure there, Mr. Booth, and becoming my
character; by G---- I ought not to be despised too much if my nature is
not totally without its weaknesses.' He uttered this, and some more of
the same kind, with great majesty, or, as he called it, dignity. Indeed,
he used some hard words that I did not understand; for all his words
are not to be found in a dictionary. Upon the whole, I could not easily
refrain from laughter; however, I conquered myself, and soon after
retired from him, astonished that it was possible for a man to possess
true goodness, and be at the same time ashamed of it.

"But, if I was surprized at what had past at this visit, how much more
was I surprized the next morning, when he came very early to my chamber,
and told me he had not been able to sleep one wink at what had past
between us! 'There were some words of yours,' says he, 'which must be
further explained before we part. You told me, sir, when you found me
in that situation, which I cannot bear to recollect, that you thought
I could not appear in one more becoming my character; these were the
words--I shall never forget them. Do you imagine that there is any of
the dignity of a man wanting in my character? do you think that I have,
during my sister's illness, behaved with a weakness that savours too
much of effeminacy? I know how much it is beneath a man to whine and
whimper about a trifling girl as well as you or any man; and, if my
sister had died, I should have behaved like a man on the occasion. I
would not have you think I confined myself from company merely upon her
account. I was very much disordered myself. And when you surprized me
in that situation--I repeat again, in that situation--her nurse had
not left the room three minutes, and I was blowing the fire for fear it
should have gone out.'--In this manner he ran on almost a quarter of an
hour before he would suffer me to speak. At last, looking steadfastly
in his face, I asked him if I must conclude that he was in earnest? 'In
earnest!' says he, repeating my words, 'do you then take my character
for a jest?'--Lookee, sir, said I, very gravely, I think we know one
another very well; and I have no reason to suspect you should impute it
to fear when I tell you I was so far from intending to affront you, that
I meant you one of the highest compliments. Tenderness for women is so
far from lessening, that it proves a true manly character. The manly
Brutus shewed the utmost tenderness to his Portia; and the great king
of Sweden, the bravest, and even fiercest of men, shut himself up three
whole days in the midst of a campaign, and would see no company, on the
death of a favourite sister. At these words I saw his features soften;
and he cried out, 'D--n me, I admire the king of Sweden of all the men
in the world; and he is a rascal that is ashamed of doing anything which
the king of Sweden did.--And yet, if any king of Sweden in France was to
tell me that his sister had more merit than mine, by G---- I'd knock
his brains about his ears. Poor little Betsy! she is the honestest,
worthiest girl that ever was born. Heaven be praised, she is recovered;
for, if I had lost her, I never should have enjoyed another happy
moment.' In this manner he ran on some time, till the tears began to
overflow; which when he perceived, he stopt; perhaps he was unable to go
on; for he seemed almost choaked: after a short silence, however, having
wiped his eyes with his handkerchief, he fetched a deep sigh, and cried,
'I am ashamed you should see this, Mr. Booth; but d--n me, nature will
get the better of dignity.' I now comforted him with the example of
Xerxes, as I had before done with that of the king of Sweden; and soon
after we sat down to breakfast together with much cordial friendship;
for I assure you, with all his oddity, there is not a better-natured man
in the world than the major."

"Good-natured, indeed!" cries Miss Matthews, with great scorn. "A fool!
how can you mention such a fellow with commendation?"

Booth spoke as much as he could in defence of his friend; indeed, he
had represented him in as favourable a light as possible, and had
particularly left out those hard words with which, as he hath observed a
little before, the major interlarded his discourse. Booth then proceeded
as in the next chapter.




Chapter ix.

_Containing very extraordinary matters._


"Miss Bath," continued Booth, "now recovered so fast, that she was
abroad as soon as my wife. Our little partie quarree began to grow
agreeable again; and we mixed with the company of the place more than we
had done before. Mons. Bagillard now again renewed his intimacy, for the
countess, his mistress, was gone to Paris; at which my wife, at first,
shewed no dissatisfaction; and I imagined that, as she had a friend
and companion of her own sex (for Miss Bath and she had contracted
the highest fondness for each other), that she would the less miss my
company. However, I was disappointed in this expectation; for she soon
began to express her former uneasiness, and her impatience for the
arrival of Captain James, that we might entirely quit Montpelier.

"I could not avoid conceiving some little displeasure at this humour of
my wife, which I was forced to think a little unreasonable."--"A little,
do you call it?" says Miss Matthews: "Good Heavens! what a husband are
you!"--"How little worthy," answered he, "as you will say hereafter, of
such a wife as my Amelia. One day, as we were sitting together, I heard
a violent scream; upon which my wife, starting up, cried out, 'Sure
that's Miss Bath's voice;' and immediately ran towards the chamber
whence it proceeded. I followed her; and when we arrived, we there
beheld the most shocking sight imaginable; Miss Bath lying dead on the
floor, and the major all bloody kneeling by her, and roaring out for
assistance. Amelia, though she was herself in little better condition
than her friend, ran hastily to her, bared her neck, and attempted to
loosen her stays, while I ran up and down, scarce knowing what I did,
calling for water and cordials, and despatching several servants one
after another for doctors and surgeons.

"Water, cordials, and all necessary implements being brought, Miss Bath
was at length recovered, and placed in her chair, when the major seated
himself by her. And now, the young lady being restored to life, the
major, who, till then, had engaged as little of his own as of any
other person's attention, became the object of all our considerations,
especially his poor sister's, who had no sooner recovered sufficient
strength than she began to lament her brother, crying out that he was
killed; and bitterly bewailing her fate, in having revived from her
swoon to behold so dreadful a spectacle. While Amelia applied herself to
soothe the agonies of her friend, I began to enquire into the condition
of the major, in which I was assisted by a surgeon, who now arrived. The
major declared, with great chearfulness, that he did not apprehend his
wound to be in the least dangerous, and therefore begged his sister to
be comforted, saying he was conving this, as I hope the
news will be agreeable to you. My chariot will attend at the same time
to carry you wherever you please. You may easily guess what a violence
I have done to myself in not waiting on you in person; but I, who know
your delicacy, feared it might offend, and that you might think me
ungenerous enough to hope from your distresses that happiness which I
am resolved to owe to your free gift alone, when your good nature shall
induce you to bestow on me what no man living can merit. I beg you will
pardon all the contents of this hasty letter, and do me the honour of
believing me, Dearest madam,

Your most passionate admirer,

and most obedient humble servant,

DAMON."

Booth thought he had somewhere before seen the same hand, but in his
present hurry of spirits could not recollect whose it was, nor did the
lady give him any time for reflection; for he had scarce read the letter
when she produced a little bit of paper and cried out, "Here, sir,
here are the contents which he fears will offend me." She then put a
bank-bill of a hundred pounds into Mr. Booth's hands, and asked him with
a smile if he did not think she had reason to be offended with so much
insolence?

Before Booth could return any answer the governor arrived, and
introduced Mr. Rogers the attorney, who acquainted the lady that he had
brought her discharge from her confinement, and that a chariot waited at
the door to attend her wherever she pleased.

She received the discharge from Mr. Rogers, and said she was very much
obliged to the gentleman who employed him, but that she would not make
use of the chariot, as she had no notion of leaving that wretched place
in a triumphant manner; in which resolution, when the attorney found her
obstinate, he withdrew, as did the governor, with many bows and as many
ladyships.

They were no sooner gone than Booth asked the lady why she would refuse
the chariot of a gentleman who had behaved with such excessive respect?
She looked earnestly upon him, and cried, "How unkind is that question!
do you imagine I would go and leave you in such a situation? thou
knowest but little of Calista. Why, do you think I would accept this
hundred pounds from a man I dislike, unless it was to be serviceable
to the man I love? I insist on your taking it as your own and using
whatever you want of it."

Booth protested in the solemnest manner that he would not touch a
shilling of it, saying, he had already received too many obligations at
her hands, and more than ever he should be able, he feared, to repay.
"How unkind," answered she, "is every word you say, why will you mention
obligations? love never confers any. It doth everything for its own
sake. I am not therefore obliged to the man whose passion makes him
generous; for I feel how inconsiderable the whole world would appear to
me if I could throw it after my heart."

Much more of this kind past, she still pressing the bank-note upon
him, and he as absolutely refusing, till Booth left the lady to dress
herself, and went to walk in the area of the prison.

Miss Matthews now applied to the governor to know by what means she
might procure the captain his liberty. The governor answered, "As he
cannot get bail, it will be a difficult matter; and money to be sure
there must be; for people no doubt expect to touch on these occasions.
When prisoners have not wherewithal as the law requires to entitle
themselves to justice, why they must be beholden to other people to give
them their liberty; and people will not, to be sure, suffer others to
be beholden to them for nothing, whereof there is good reason; for how
should we all live if it was not for these things?" "Well, well,"
said she, "and how much will it cost?" "How much!" answered he,--"How
much!--why, let me see."--Here he hesitated some time, and then answered
"That for five guineas he would undertake to procure the captain his
discharge. "That being the sum which he computed to remain in the lady's
pocket; for, as to the gentleman's, he had long been acquainted with the
emptiness of it.

Miss Matthews, to whom money was as dirt (indeed she may be thought not
to have known the value of it), delivered him the bank-bill, and bid
him get it changed; for if the whole, says she, will procure him his
liberty, he shall have it this evening.

"The whole, madam!" answered the governor, as soon as he had recovered
his breath, for it almost forsook him at the sight of the black word
hundred--"No, no; there might be people indeed--but I am not one of
those. A hundred! no, nor nothing like it.--As for myself, as I said, I
will be content with five guineas, and I am sure that's little enough.
What other people will expect I cannot exactly say. To be sure his
worship's clerk will expect to touch pretty handsomely; as for his
worship himself, he never touches anything, that is, not to speak of;
but then the constable will expect something, and the watchman must have
something, and the lawyers on both sides, they must have their fees
for finishing."--"Well," said she, "I leave all to you. If it costs me
twenty pounds I will have him discharged this afternoon.--But you
must give his discharge into my hands without letting the captain know
anything of the matter."

The governor promised to obey her commands in every particular; nay, he
was so very industrious, that, though dinner was just then coming upon
the table, at her earnest request he set out immediately on the purpose,
and went as he said in pursuit of the lawyer.

All the other company assembled at table as usual, where poor Booth was
the only person out of spirits. This was imputed by all present to a
wrong cause; nay, Miss Matthews herself either could not or would
not suspect that there was anything deeper than the despair of being
speedily discharged that lay heavy on his mind.

However, the mirth of the rest, and a pretty liberal quantity of punch,
which he swallowed after dinner (for Miss Matthews had ordered a very
large bowl at her own expense to entertain the good company at her
farewell), so far exhilarated his spirits, that when the young lady
and he retired to their tea he had all the marks of gayety in his
countenance, and his eyes sparkled with good humour.

The gentleman and lady had spent about two hours in tea and
conversation, when the governor returned, and privately delivered to the
lady the discharge for her friend, and the sum of eighty-two pounds five
shillings; the rest having been, he said, disbursed in the business, of
which he was ready at any time to render an exact account.

Miss Matthews being again alone with Mr. Booth, she put the discharge
into his hands, desiring him to ask her no questions; and adding,
"I think, sir, we have neither of us now anything more to do at this
place." She then summoned the governor, and ordered a bill of that day's
expense, for long scores were not usual there; and at the same time
ordered a hackney coach, without having yet determined whither she would
go, but fully determined she was, wherever she went, to take Mr. Booth
with her.

The governor was now approaching with a long roll of paper, when a faint
voice was heard to cry out hastily, "Where is he?"--and presently a
female spectre, all pale and breathless, rushed into the room, and fell
into Mr. Booth's arms, where she immediately fainted away.

Booth made a shift to support his lovely burden; though he was himself
in a condition very little different from hers. Miss Matthews likewise,
who presently recollected the face of Amelia, was struck motionless
with the surprize, nay, the governor himself, though not easily moved at
sights of horror, stood aghast, and neither offered to speak nor stir.

Happily for Amelia, the governess of the mansions had, out of curiosity,
followed her into the room, and was the only useful person present on
this occasion: she immediately called for water, and ran to the lady's
assistance, fell to loosening her stays, and performed all the offices
proper at such a season; which had so good an effect, that Amelia soon
recovered the disorder which the violent agitation of her spirits had
caused, and found herself alive and awake in her husband's arms.

Some tender caresses and a soft whisper or two passed privately between
Booth and his lady; nor was it without great difficulty that poor Amelia
put some restraint on her fondness in a place so improper for a tender
interview. She now cast her eyes round the room, and, fixing them on
Miss Matthews, who stood like a statue, she soon recollected her, and,
addressing her by her name, said, "Sure, madam, I cannot be mistaken in
those features; though meeting you here might almost make me suspect my
memory."

Miss Matthews's face was now all covered with scarlet. The reader may
easily believe she was on no account pleased with Amelia's presence;
indeed, she expected from her some of those insults of which virtuous
women are generally so liberal to a frail sister: but she was mistaken;
Amelia was not one

     Who thought the nation ne'er would thrive,
     Till all the whores were burnt alive.

Her virtue could support itself with its own intrinsic worth, without
borrowing any assistance from the vices of other women; and she
considered their natural infirmities as the objects of pity, not of
contempt or abhorrence.

When Amelia therefore perceived the visible confusion in Miss Matthews
she presently called to remembrance some stories which she had
imperfectly heard; for, as she was not naturally attentive to scandal,
and had kept very little company since her return to England, she was
far from being a mistress of the lady's whole history. However, she had
heard enough to impute her confusion to the right cause; she advanced to
her, and told her, she was extremely sorry to meet her in such a place,
but hoped that no very great misfortune was the occasion of it.

Miss Matthews began, by degrees, to recover her spirits. She answered,
with a reserved air, "I am much obliged to you, madam, for your concern;
we are all liable to misfortunes in this world. Indeed, I know not why
I should be much ashamed of being in any place where I am in such good
company."

Here Booth interposed. He had before acquainted Amelia in a whisper that
his confinement was at an end. "The unfortunate accident, my dear," said
he, "which brought this young lady to this melancholy place is entirely
determined; and she is now as absolutely at her liberty as myself."

Amelia, imputing the extreme coldness and reserve of the lady to the
cause already mentioned, advanced still more and more in proportion as
she drew back; till the governor, who had withdrawn some time, returned,
and acquainted Miss Matthews that her coach was at the door; upon which
the company soon separated. Amelia and Booth went together in Amelia's
coach, and poor Miss Matthews was obliged to retire alone, after
having satisfied the demands of the governor, which in one day only had
amounted to a pretty considerable sum; for he, with great dexterity,
proportioned the bills to the abilities of his guests.

It may seem, perhaps, wonderful to some readers, that Miss Matthews
should have maintained that cold reserve towards Amelia, so as barely to
keep within the rules of civility, instead of embracing an opportunity
which seemed to offer of gaining some degree of intimacy with a wife
whose husband she was so fond of; but, besides that her spirits were
entirely disconcerted by so sudden and unexpected a disappointment; and
besides the extreme horrors which she conceived at the presence of her
rival, there is, I believe, something so outrageously suspicious in
the nature of all vice, especially when joined with any great degree of
pride, that the eyes of those whom we imagine privy to our failings are
intolerable to us, and we are apt to aggravate their opinions to our
disadvantage far beyond the reality.




Chapter iii.

_Containing wise observations of the author, and other matters._


There is nothing more difficult than to lay down any fixed and certain
rules for happiness; or indeed to judge with any precision of the
happiness of others from the knowledge of external circumstances. There
is sometimes a little speck of black in the brightest and gayest colours
of fortune, which contaminates and deadens the whole. On the contrary,
when all without looks dark and dismal, there is often a secret ray of
light within the mind, which turns everything to real joy and gladness.

I have in the course of my life seen many occasions to make this
observation, and Mr. Booth was at present a very pregnant instance of
its truth. He was just delivered from a prison, and in the possession of
his beloved wife and children; and (which might be imagined greatly
to augment his joy) fortune had done all this for him within an hour,
without giving him the least warning or reasonable expectation of the
strange reverse in his circumstances; and yet it is certain that there
were very few men in the world more seriously miserable than he was at
this instant. A deep melancholy seized his mind, and cold damp sweats
overspread his person, so that he was scarce animated; and poor Amelia,
instead of a fond warm husband, bestowed her caresses on a dull lifeless
lump of clay. He endeavoured, however, at first, as much as possible, to
conceal what he felt, and attempted what is the hardest of all tasks, to
act the part of a happy man; but he found no supply of spirits to carry
on this deceit, and would have probably sunk under his attempt, had not
poor Amelia's simplicity helped him to another fallacy, in which he had
much better success.

This worthy woman very plainly perceived the disorder in her husband's
mind; and, having no doubt of the cause of it, especially when she saw
the tears stand in his eyes at the sight of his children, threw her arms
round his neck, and, embracing him with rapturous fondness, cried out,
"My dear Billy, let nothing make you uneasy. Heaven will, I doubt not,
provide for us and these poor babes. Great fortunes are not necessary to
happiness. For my own part, I can level my mind with any state; and for
those poor little things, whatever condition of life we breed them to,
that will be sufficient to maintain them in. How many thousands abound
in affluence whose fortunes are much lower than ours! for it is not
from nature, but from education and habit, that our wants are chiefly
derived. Make yourself easy, therefore, my dear love; for you have a
wife who will think herself happy with you, and endeavour to make you
so, in any situation. Fear nothing, Billy, industry will always provide
us a wholesome meal; and I will take care that neatness and chearfulness
shall make it a pleasant one."

Booth presently took the cue which she had given him. He fixed his eyes
on her for a minute with great earnestness and inexpressible tenderness;
and then cried, "O my Amelia, how much are you my superior in every
perfection! how wise, how great, how noble are your sentiments! why
can I not imitate what I so much admire? why can I not look with your
constancy on those dear little pledges of our loves? All my philosophy
is baffled with the thought that my Amelia's children are to struggle
with a cruel, hard, unfeeling world, and to buffet those waves of
fortune which have overwhelmed their father.--Here, I own I want your
firmness, and am not without an excuse for wanting it; for am I not the
cruel cause of all your wretchedness? have I not stept between you
and fortune, and been the cursed obstacle to all your greatness and
happiness?"

"Say not so, my love," answered she. "Great I might have been, but never
happy with any other man. Indeed, dear Billy, I laugh at the fears you
formerly raised in me; what seemed so terrible at a distance, now it
approaches nearer, appears to have been a mere bugbear--and let this
comfort you, that I look on myself at this day as the happiest of women;
nor have I done anything which I do not rejoice in, and would, if I had
the gift of prescience, do again."

Booth was so overcome with this behaviour, that he had no words to
answer. To say the truth, it was difficult to find any worthy of the
occasion. He threw himself prostrate at her feet, whence poor Amelia was
forced to use all her strength as well as entreaties to raise and place
him in his chair.

Such is ever the fortitude of perfect innocence, and such the depression
of guilt in minds not utterly abandoned. Booth was naturally of a
sanguine temper; nor would any such apprehensions as he mentioned have
been sufficient to have restrained his joy at meeting with his Amelia.
In fact, a reflection on the injury he had done her was the sole cause
of his grief. This it was that enervated his heart, and threw him into
agonies, which all that profusion of heroic tenderness that the most
excellent of women intended for his comfort served only to heighten
and aggravate; as the more she rose in his admiration, the more she
quickened his sense of his own unworthiness. After a disagreeable
evening, the first of that kind that he had ever passed with his Amelia,
in which he had the utmost difficulty to force a little chearfulness,
and in which her spirits were at length overpowered by discerning the
oppression on his, they retired to rest, or rather to misery, which need
not be described.

The next morning at breakfast, Booth began to recover a little from
his melancholy, and to taste the company of his children. He now first
thought of enquiring of Amelia by what means she had discovered the
place of his confinement. Amelia, after gently rebuking him for not
having himself acquainted her with it, informed him that it was known
all over the country, and that she had traced the original of it to
her sister; who had spread the news with a malicious joy, and added
a circumstance which would have frightened her to death, had not her
knowledge of him made her give little credit to it, which was, that he
was committed for murder. But, though she had discredited this part, she
said the not hearing from him during several successive posts made her
too apprehensive of the rest; that she got a conveyance therefore for
herself and children to Salisbury, from whence the stage coach had
brought them to town; and, having deposited the children at his lodging,
of which he had sent her an account on his first arrival in town, she
took a hack, and came directly to the prison where she heard he was, and
where she found him.

Booth excused himself, and with truth, as to his not having writ; for,
in fact, he had writ twice from the prison, though he had mentioned
nothing of his confinement; but, as he sent away his letters after nine
at night, the fellow to whom they were entrusted had burnt them both
for the sake of putting the twopence in his own pocket, or rather in
the pocket of the keeper of the next gin-shop. As to the account
which Amelia gave him, it served rather to raise than to satisfy his
curiosity. He began to suspect that some person had seen both him and
Miss Matthews together in the prison, and had confounded her case with
his; and this the circumstance of murder made the more probable. But
who this person should be he could not guess. After giving himself,
therefore, some pains in forming conjectures to no purpose, he was
forced to rest contented with his ignorance of the real truth.

Two or three days now passed without producing anything remarkable;
unless it were that Booth more and more recovered his spirits, and
had now almost regained his former degree of chearfulness, when the
following letter arrived, again to torment him:


"DEAR BILLY,

"To convince you I am the most reasonable of women, I have given you up
three whole days to the unmolested possession of my fortunate rival; I
can refrain no longer from letting you know that I lodge in Dean Street,
not far from the church, at the sign of the Pelican and Trumpet, where I
expect this evening to see you.

"Believe me I am, with more affection than any other woman in the world
can be, my dear Billy, Your affectionate, fond, doating

"F. MATTHEWS."

Booth tore the letter with rage, and threw it into the fire, resolving
never to visit the lady more, unless it was to pay her the money she had
lent him, which he was determined to do the very first opportunity, for
it was not at present in his power.

This letter threw him back into his fit of dejection, in which he
had not continued long when a packet from the country brought him the
following from his friend Dr Harrison:

"Sir, _Lyons, January 21, N. S._

"Though I am now on my return home, I have taken up my pen to
communicate to you some news I have heard from England, which gives me
much uneasiness, and concerning which I can indeed deliver my sentiments
with much more ease this way than any other. In my answer to your last,
I very freely gave you my opinion, in which it was my misfortune to
disapprove of every step you had taken; but those were all pardonable
errors. Can you be so partial to yourself, upon cool and sober
reflexion, to think what I am going to mention is so? I promise you, it
appears to me a folly of so monstrous a kind, that, had I heard it from
any but a person of the highest honour, I should have rejected it as
utterly incredible. I hope you already guess what I am about to name;
since, Heaven forbid, your conduct should afford you any choice of such
gross instances of weakness. In a word, then, you have set up an
equipage. What shall I invent in your excuse, either to others or to
myself? In truth, I can find no excuse for you, and, what is more, I am
certain you can find none for yourself. I must deal therefore very
plainly and sincerely with you. Vanity is always contemptible; but when
joined with dishonesty, it becomes odious and detestable. At whose
expence are you to support this equipage? is it not entirely at the
expence of others? and will it not finally end in that of your poor wife
and children? you know you are two years in arrears to me. If I could
impute this to any extraordinary or common accident I think I should
never have mentioned it; but I will not suffer my money to support the
ridiculous, and, I must say, criminal vanity of any one. I expect,
therefore, to find, at my return, that you have either discharged my
whole debt, or your equipage. Let me beg you seriously to consider your
circumstances and condition in life, and to remember that your situation
will not justify any the least unnecessary expence. _Simply to be poor,_
says my favourite Greek historian, _was not held scandalous by the wise
Athenians, but highly so to owe that poverty to our own indiscretion._

"Present my affections to Mrs. Booth, and be assured that I shall not,
without great reason, and great pain too, ever cease to be, Your most
faithful friend,

"R. HARRISON."

Had this letter come at any other time, it would have given Booth the
most sensible affliction; but so totally had the affair of Miss Matthews
possessed his mind, that, like a man in the most raging fit of the gout,
he was scarce capable of any additional torture; nay, he even made an
use of this latter epistle, as it served to account to Amelia for that
concern which he really felt on another account. The poor deceived lady,
therefore, applied herself to give him comfort where he least wanted
it. She said he might easily perceive that the matter had been
misrepresented to the doctor, who would not, she was sure, retain the
least anger against him when he knew the real truth.

After a short conversation on this subject, in which Booth appeared to
be greatly consoled by the arguments of his wife, they parted. He went
to take a walk in the Park, and she remained at home to prepare him his
dinner.

He was no sooner departed than his little boy, not quite six years old,
said to Amelia, "La! mamma, what is the matter with poor papa, what
makes him look so as if he was going to cry? he is not half so merry as
he used to be in the country." Amelia answered, "Oh! my dear, your papa
is only a little thoughtful, he will be merry again soon."--Then looking
fondly on her children, she burst into an agony of tears, and cried,
"Oh Heavens; what have these poor little infants done? why will the
barbarous world endeavour to starve them, by depriving us of our only
friend?--O my dear, your father is ruined, and we are undone!"--The
children presently accompanied their mother's tears, and the daughter
cried--"Why, will anybody hurt poor papa? hath he done any harm to
anybody?"--"No, my dear child," said the mother; "he is the best man
in the world, and therefore they hate him." Upon which the boy, who was
extremely sensible at his years, answered, "Nay, mamma, how can that be?
have not you often told me that if I was good everybody would love me?"
"All good people will," answered she. "Why don't they love papa then?"
replied the child, "for I am sure he is very good." "So they do, my
dear," said the mother, "but there are more bad people in the world, and
they will hate you for your goodness." "Why then, bad people," cries
the child, "are loved by more than the good."--"No matter for that, my
dear," said she; "the love of one good person is more worth having than
that of a thousand wicked ones; nay, if there was no such person in the
world, still you must be a good boy; for there is one in Heaven who will
love you, and his love is better for you than that of all mankind."

This little dialogue, we are apprehensive, will be read with contempt by
many; indeed, we should not have thought it worth recording, was it not
for the excellent example which Amelia here gives to all mothers. This
admirable woman never let a day pass without instructing her children in
some lesson of religion and morality. By which means she had, in their
tender minds, so strongly annexed the ideas of fear and shame to every
idea of evil of which they were susceptible, that it must require great
pains and length of habit to separate them. Though she was the tenderest
of mothers, she never suffered any symptom of malevolence to shew itself
in their most trifling actions without discouragement, without rebuke,
and, if it broke forth with any rancour, without punishment. In which
she had such success, that not the least mark of pride, envy, malice, or
spite discovered itself in any of their little words or deeds.




Chapter iv.

_In which Amelia appears in no unamiable light._


Amelia, with the assistance of a little girl, who was their only
servant, had drest her dinner, and she had likewise drest herself as
neat as any lady who had a regular sett of servants could have done,
when Booth returned, and brought with him his friend James, whom he had
met with in the Park; and who, as Booth absolutely refused to dine away
from his wife, to whom he had promised to return, had invited himself to
dine with him. Amelia had none of that paultry pride which possesses so
many of her sex, and which disconcerts their tempers, and gives them the
air and looks of furies, if their husbands bring in an unexpected guest,
without giving them timely warning to provide a sacrifice to their
own vanity. Amelia received her husband's friend with the utmost
complaisance and good humour: she made indeed some apology for the
homeliness of her dinner; but it was politely turned as a compliment to
Mr. James's friendship, which could carry him where he was sure of being
so ill entertained; and gave not the least hint how magnificently
she would have provided _had she expected the favour of so much good
company._ A phrase which is generally meant to contain not only an
apology for the lady of the house, but a tacit satire on her guests for
their intrusion, and is at least a strong insinuation that they are not
welcome.

Amelia failed not to enquire very earnestly after her old friend Mrs.
James, formerly Miss Bath, and was very sorry to find that she was not
in town. The truth was, as James had married out of a violent liking of,
or appetite to, her person, possession had surfeited him, and he was
now grown so heartily tired of his wife, that she had very little of
his company; she was forced therefore to content herself with being the
mistress of a large house and equipage in the country ten months in the
year by herself. The other two he indulged her with the diversions of
the town; but then, though they lodged under the same roof, she had
little more of her husband's society than if they had been one hundred
miles apart. With all this, as she was a woman of calm passions, she
made herself contented; for she had never had any violent affection for
James: the match was of the prudent kind, and to her advantage; for his
fortune, by the death of an uncle, was become very considerable; and
she had gained everything by the bargain but a husband, which her
constitution suffered her to be very well satisfied without.

When Amelia, after dinner, retired to her children, James began to talk
to his friend concerning his affairs. He advised Booth very earnestly to
think of getting again into the army, in which he himself had met with
such success, that he had obtained the command of a regiment to which
his brother-in-law was lieutenant-colonel. These preferments they both
owed to the favour of fortune only; for, though there was no objection
to either of their military characters, yet neither of them had any
extraordinary desert; and, if merit in the service was a sufficient
recommendation, Booth, who had been twice wounded in the siege, seemed
to have the fairest pretensions; but he remained a poor half-pay
lieutenant, and the others were, as we have said, one of them a
lieutenant-colonel, and the other had a regiment. Such rises we often
see in life, without being able to give any satisfactory account of the
means, and therefore ascribe them to the good fortune of the person.

Both Colonel James and his brother-in-law were members of parliament;
for, as the uncle of the former had left him, together with his estate,
an almost certain interest in a borough, so he chose to confer this
favour on Colonel Bath; a circumstance which would have been highly
immaterial to mention here, but as it serves to set forth the goodness
of James, who endeavoured to make up in kindness to the family what he
wanted in fondness for his wife.

Colonel James then endeavoured all in his power to persuade Booth to
think again of a military life, and very kindly offered him his interest
towards obtaining him a company in the regiment under his command. Booth
must have been a madman, in his present circumstances, to have hesitated
one moment at accepting such an offer, and he well knew Amelia,
notwithstanding her aversion to the army, was much too wise to make
the least scruple of giving her consent. Nor was he, as it appeared
afterwards, mistaken in his opinion of his wife's understanding; for
she made not the least objection when it was communicated to her, but
contented herself with an express stipulation, that wherever he was
commanded to go (for the regiment was now abroad) she would accompany
him.

Booth, therefore, accepted his friend's proposal with a profusion of
acknowledgments; and it was agreed that Booth should draw up a memorial
of his pretensions, which Colonel James undertook to present to some man
of power, and to back it with all the force he had.

Nor did the friendship of the colonel stop here. "You will excuse me,
dear Booth," said he, "if, after what you have told me" (for he had been
very explicit in revealing his affairs to him), "I suspect you must want
money at this time. If that be the case, as I am certain it must be, I
have fifty pieces at your service." This generosity brought the tears
into Booth's eyes; and he at length confest that he had not five guineas
in the house; upon which James gave him a bank-bill for twenty pounds,
and said he would give him thirty more the next time he saw him.

Thus did this generous colonel (for generous he really was to the
highest degree) restore peace and comfort to this little family; and
by this act of beneficence make two of the worthiest people two of the
happiest that evening.

Here, reader, give me leave to stop a minute, to lament that so few are
to be found of this benign disposition; that, while wantonness, vanity,
avarice, and ambition are every day rioting and triumphing in the
follies and weakness, the ruin and desolation of mankind, scarce one man
in a thousand is capable of tasting the happiness of others. Nay, give
me leave to wonder that pride, which is constantly struggling, and often
imposing on itself, to gain some little pre-eminence, should so seldom
hint to us the only certain as well as laudable way of setting ourselves
above another man, and that is, by becoming his benefactor.




Chapter v.

_Containing an eulogium upon innocence, and other grave matters._


Booth past that evening, and all the succeeding day, with his Amelia,
without the interruption of almost a single thought concerning Miss
Matthews, after having determined to go on the Sunday, the only day he
could venture without the verge in the present state of his affairs, and
pay her what she had advanced for him in the prison. But she had not so
long patience; for the third day, while he was sitting with Amelia, a
letter was brought to him. As he knew the hand, he immediately put
it into his pocket unopened, not without such an alteration in his
countenance, that had Amelia, who was then playing with one of the
children, cast her eyes towards him, she must have remarked it. This
accident, however, luckily gave him time to recover himself; for Amelia
was so deeply engaged with the little one, that she did not even remark
the delivery of the letter. The maid soon after returned into the room,
saying, the chairman desired to know if there was any answer to the
letter.--"What letter?" cries Booth.--"The letter I gave you just now,"
answered the girl.--"Sure," cries Booth, "the child is mad, you gave me
no letter."--"Yes, indeed, I did, sir," said the poor girl. "Why then
as sure as fate," cries Booth, "I threw it into the fire in my reverie;
why, child, why did you not tell me it was a letter? bid the chairman
come up, stay, I will go down myself; for he will otherwise dirt the
stairs with his feet."

Amelia was gently chiding the girl for her carelessness when Booth
returned, saying it was very true that she had delivered him a letter
from Colonel James, and that perhaps it might be of consequence.
"However," says he, "I will step to the coffee-house, and send him an
account of this strange accident, which I know he will pardon in my
present situation."

Booth was overjoyed at this escape, which poor Amelia's total want of
all jealousy and suspicion made it very easy for him to accomplish; but
his pleasure was considerably abated when, upon opening the letter, he
found it to contain, mixed with several very strong expressions of love,
some pretty warm ones of the upbraiding kind; but what most alarmed him
was a hint that it was in her (Miss Matthews's) power to make Amelia as
miserable as herself. Besides the general knowledge of

_----Furens quid faemina possit,_

he had more particular reasons to apprehend the rage of a lady who had
given so strong an instance how far she could carry her revenge. She had
already sent a chairman to his lodgings with a positive command not
to return without an answer to her letter. This might of itself have
possibly occasioned a discovery; and he thought he had great reason to
fear that, if she did not carry matters so far as purposely and avowedly
to reveal the secret to Amelia, her indiscretion would at least effect
the discovery of that which he would at any price have concealed. Under
these terrors he might, I believe, be considered as the most wretched of
human beings.

O innocence, how glorious and happy a portion art thou to the breast
that possesses thee! thou fearest neither the eyes nor the tongues of
men. Truth, the most powerful of all things, is thy strongest friend;
and the brighter the light is in which thou art displayed, the more it
discovers thy transcendent beauties. Guilt, on the contrary, like a
base thief, suspects every eye that beholds him to be privy to
his transgressions, and every tongue that mentions his name to be
proclaiming them. Fraud and falsehood are his weak and treacherous
allies; and he lurks trembling in the dark, dreading every ray of light,
lest it should discover him, and give him up to shame and punishment.

While Booth was walking in the Park with all these horrors in his mind
he again met his friend Colonel James, who soon took notice of that
deep concern which the other was incapable of hiding. After some little
conversation, Booth said, "My dear colonel, I am sure I must be the most
insensible of men if I did not look on you as the best and the truest
friend; I will, therefore, without scruple, repose a confidence in you
of the highest kind. I have often made you privy to my necessities, I
will now acquaint you with my shame, provided you have leisure enough to
give me a hearing: for I must open to you a long history, since I will
not reveal my fault without informing you, at the same time, of those
circumstances which, I hope, will in some measure excuse it."

The colonel very readily agreed to give his friend a patient hearing. So
they walked directly to a coffee-house at the corner of Spring-Garden,
where, being in a room by themselves, Booth opened his whole heart, and
acquainted the colonel with his amour with Miss Matthews, from the very
beginning to his receiving that letter which had caused all his present
uneasiness, and which he now delivered into his friend's hand.

The colonel read the letter very attentively twice over (he was silent
indeed long enough to have read it oftener); and then, turning to Booth,
said, "Well, sir, and is it so grievous a calamity to be the object of
a young lady's affection; especially of one whom you allow to be so
extremely handsome?" "Nay, but, my dear friend," cries Booth, "do not
jest with me; you who know my Amelia." "Well, my dear friend," answered
James, "and you know Amelia and this lady too. But what would you have
me do for you?" "I would have you give me your advice," says Booth,
"by what method I shall get rid of this dreadful woman without a
discovery."--"And do you really," cries the other, "desire to get rid of
her?" "Can you doubt it," said Booth, "after what I have communicated
to you, and after what you yourself have seen in my family? for I hope,
notwithstanding this fatal slip, I do not appear to you in the light of
a profligate." "Well," answered James, "and, whatever light I may appear
to you in, if you are really tired of the lady, and if she be really
what you have represented her, I'll endeavour to take her off
your hands; but I insist upon it that you do not deceive me in any
particular." Booth protested in the most solemn manner that every word
which he had spoken was strictly true; and being asked whether he would
give his honour never more to visit the lady, he assured James that
he never would. He then, at his friend's request, delivered him Miss
Matthews's letter, in which was a second direction to her lodgings, and
declared to him that, if he could bring him safely out of this terrible
affair, he should think himself to have a still higher obligation to his
friendship than any which he had already received from it.

Booth pressed the colonel to go home with him to dinner; but he excused
himself, being, as he said, already engaged. However, he undertook in
the afternoon to do all in his power that Booth should receive no more
alarms from the quarter of Miss Matthews, whom the colonel undertook
to pay all the demands she had on his friend. They then separated. The
colonel went to dinner at the King's Arms, and Booth returned in high
spirits to meet his Amelia.

The next day, early in the morning, the colonel came to the coffee-house
and sent for his friend, who lodged but at a little distance. The
colonel told him he had a little exaggerated the lady's beauty; however,
he said, he excused that, "for you might think, perhaps," cries he,
"that your inconstancy to the finest woman in the world might want some
excuse. Be that as it will," said he, "you may make yourself easy, as
it will be, I am convinced, your own fault, if you have ever any further
molestation from Miss Matthews."

Booth poured forth very warmly a great profusion of gratitude on this
occasion; and nothing more anywise material passed at this interview,
which was very short, the colonel being in a great hurry, as he had, he
said, some business of very great importance to transact that morning.

The colonel had now seen Booth twice without remembering to give him the
thirty pounds. This the latter imputed intirely to forgetfulness; for
he had always found the promises of the former to be equal in value
with the notes or bonds of other people. He was more surprized at what
happened the next day, when, meeting his friend in the Park, he received
only a cold salute from him; and though he past him five or six times,
and the colonel was walking with a single officer of no great rank, and
with whom he seemed in no earnest conversation, yet could not Booth, who
was alone, obtain any further notice from him.

This gave the poor man some alarm; though he could scarce persuade
himself that there was any design in all this coldness or forgetfulness.
Once he imagined that he had lessened himself in the colonel's opinion
by having discovered his inconstancy to Amelia; but the known character
of the other presently cured him of his suspicion, for he was a perfect
libertine with regard to women; that being indeed the principal blemish
in his character, which otherwise might have deserved much commendation
for good-nature, generosity, and friendship. But he carried this one
to a most unpardonable height; and made no scruple of openly declaring
that, if he ever liked a woman well enough to be uneasy on her account,
he would cure himself, if he could, by enjoying her, whatever might be
the consequence.

Booth could not therefore be persuaded that the colonel would so highly
resent in another a fault of which he was himself most notoriously
guilty. After much consideration he could derive this behaviour from
nothing better than a capriciousness in his friend's temper, from a kind
of inconstancy of mind, which makes men grow weary of their friends
with no more reason than they often are of their mistresses. To say the
truth, there are jilts in friendship as well as in love; and, by the
behaviour of some men in both, one would almost imagine that they
industriously sought to gain the affections of others with a view only
of making the parties miserable.

This was the consequence of the colonel's behaviour to Booth. Former
calamities had afflicted him, but this almost distracted him; and the
more so as he was not able well to account for such conduct, nor to
conceive the reason of it.

Amelia, at his return, presently perceived the disturbance in his mind,
though he endeavoured with his utmost power to hide it; and he was at
length prevailed upon by her entreaties to discover to her the cause of
it, which she no sooner heard than she applied as judicious a remedy to
his disordered spirits as either of those great mental physicians, Tully
or Aristotle, could have thought of. She used many arguments to
persuade him that he was in an error, and had mistaken forgetfulness and
carelessness for a designed neglect.

But, as this physic was only eventually good, and as its efficacy
depended on her being in the right, a point in which she was not apt
to be too positive, she thought fit to add some consolation of a more
certain and positive kind. "Admit," said she, "my dear, that Mr. James
should prove the unaccountable person you have suspected, and should,
without being able to alledge any cause, withdraw his friendship from
you (for surely the accident of burning his letter is too trifling and
ridiculous to mention), why should this grieve you? the obligations he
hath conferred on you, I allow, ought to make his misfortunes almost
your own; but they should not, I think, make you see his faults so very
sensibly, especially when, by one of the greatest faults in the
world committed against yourself, he hath considerably lessened all
obligations; for sure, if the same person who hath contributed to my
happiness at one time doth everything in his power maliciously and
wantonly to make me miserable at another, I am very little obliged to
such a person. And let it be a comfort to my dear Billy, that, however
other friends may prove false and fickle to him, he hath one friend,
whom no inconstancy of her own, nor any change of his fortune, nor time,
nor age, nor sickness, nor any accident, can ever alter; but who will
esteem, will love, and doat on him for ever." So saying, she flung her
snowy arms about his neck, and gave him a caress so tender, that it
seemed almost to balance all the malice of his fate.

And, indeed, the behaviour of Amelia would have made him completely
happy, in defiance of all adverse circumstances, had it not been for
those bitter ingredients which he himself had thrown into his cup, and
which prevented him from truly relishing his Amelia's sweetness, by
cruelly reminding him how unworthy he was of this excellent creature.

Booth did not long remain in the dark as to the conduct of James,
which, at first, appeared to him to be so great a mystery; for this very
afternoon he received a letter from Miss Matthews which unravelled
the whole affair. By this letter, which was full of bitterness and
upbraiding, he discovered that James was his rival with that lady, and
was, indeed, the identical person who had sent the hundred-pound note to
Miss Matthews, when in the prison. He had reason to believe, likewise,
as well by the letter as by other circumstances, that James had hitherto
been an unsuccessful lover; for the lady, though she had forfeited
all title to virtue, had not yet so far forfeited all pretensions to
delicacy as to be, like the dirt in the street, indifferently common
to all. She distributed her favours only to those she liked, in which
number that gentleman had not the happiness of being included.

When Booth had made this discovery, he was not so little versed in human
nature, as any longer to hesitate at the true motive to the colonel's
conduct; for he well knew how odious a sight a happy rival is to an
unfortunate lover. I believe he was, in reality, glad to assign the
cold treatment he had received from his friend to a cause which, however
injustifiable, is at the same time highly natural; and to acquit him of
a levity, fickleness, and caprice, which he must have been unwillingly
obliged to have seen in a much worse light.

He now resolved to take the first opportunity of accosting the colonel,
and of coming to a perfect explanation upon the whole matter. He debated
likewise with himself whether he should not throw himself at Amelia's
feet, and confess a crime to her which he found so little hopes of
concealing, and which he foresaw would occasion him so many difficulties
and terrors to endeavour to conceal. Happy had it been for him, had
he wisely pursued this step; since, in all probability, he would have
received immediate forgiveness from the best of women; but he had not
sufficient resolution, or, to speak perhaps more truly, he had too much
pride, to confess his guilt, and preferred the danger of the highest
inconveniences to the certainty of being put to the blush.




Chapter vi.

_In which may appear that violence is sometimes done to the name of
love._


When that happy day came, in which unhallowed hands are forbidden to
contaminate the shoulders of the unfortunate, Booth went early to the
colonel's house, and, being admitted to his presence, began with great
freedom, though with great gentleness, to complain of his not having
dealt with him with more openness. "Why, my dear colonel," said he,
"would you not acquaint me with that secret which this letter hath
disclosed?" James read the letter, at which his countenance changed more
than once; and then, after a short silence, said, "Mr. Booth, I have
been to blame, I own it; and you upbraid me with justice. The true
reason was, that I was ashamed of my own folly. D--n me, Booth, if I
have not been a most consummate fool, a very dupe to this woman; and she
hath a particular pleasure in making me so. I know what the impertinence
of virtue is, and I can submit to it; but to be treated thus by a
whore--You must forgive me, dear Booth, but your success was a kind of
triumph over me, which I could not bear. I own, I have not the least
reason to conceive any anger against you; and yet, curse me if I should
not have been less displeased at your lying with my own wife; nay, I
could almost have parted with half my fortune to you more willingly than
have suffered you to receive that trifle of my money which you received
at her hands. However, I ask your pardon, and I promise you I will never
more think of you with the least ill-will on the account of this woman;
but as for her, d--n me if I do not enjoy her by some means or other,
whatever it costs me; for I am already above two hundred pounds out of
pocket, without having scarce had a smile in return."

Booth exprest much astonishment at this declaration; he said he could
not conceive how it was possible to have such an affection for a woman
who did not shew the least inclination to return it. James gave her
a hearty curse, and said, "Pox of her inclination; I want only the
possession of her person, and that, you will allow, is a very fine one.
But, besides my passion for her, she hath now piqued my pride; for how
can a man of my fortune brook being refused by a whore?"--"Since you are
so set on the business," cries Booth, "you will excuse my saying so, I
fancy you had better change your method of board the next time
they sat. Murphy said further that he need not fear having his money,
for that, to his certain knowledge, the captain had several things of
great value, and even his children had gold watches.

This greatly alarmed Booth, and still more when the serjeant reported to
him, from Murphy, that all these things had been seen in his possession
within a day last past. He now plainly perceived, as he thought, that
Murphy himself, or one of his emissaries, had been the supposed madman;
and he now very well accounted to himself, in his own mind, for all that
had happened, conceiving that the design was to examine into the state
of his effects, and to try whether it was worth his creditors' while to
plunder him by law.

At his return to his apartment he communicated what he had heard to
Amelia and Mrs. Ellison, not disguising his apprehensions of the enemy's
intentions; but Mrs. Ellison endeavoured to laugh him out of his fears,
calling him faint-hearted, and assuring him he might depend on her
lawyer. "Till you hear from him," said she, "you may rest entirely
contented: for, take my word for it, no danger can happen to you of
which you will not be timely apprized by him. And as for the fellow
that had the impudence to come into your room, if he was sent on such an
errand as you mention, I heartily wish I had been at home; I would have
secured him safe with a constable, and have carried him directly before
justice Thresher. I know the justice is an enemy to bailiffs on his own
account."

This heartening speech a little roused the courage of Booth, and
somewhat comforted Amelia, though the spirits of both had been too much
hurried to suffer them either to give or receive much entertainment that
evening; which Mrs. Ellison perceiving soon took her leave, and left
this unhappy couple to seek relief from sleep, that powerful friend
to the distrest, though, like other powerful friends, he is not always
ready to give his assistance to those who want it most.




Chapter ix.

_Containing a very strange incident._


When the husband and wife were alone they again talked over the news
which the serjeant had brought; on which occasion Amelia did all she
could to conceal her own fears, and to quiet those of her husband.
At last she turned the conversation to another subject, and poor Mrs.
Bennet was brought on the carpet. "I should be sorry," cries Amelia, "to
find I had conceived an affection for a bad woman; and yet I begin
to fear Mrs. Ellison knows something of her more than she cares to
discover; why else should she be unwilling to be seen with her in
public? Besides, I have observed that Mrs. Ellison hath been always
backward to introduce her to me, nor would ever bring her to my
apartment, though I have often desired her. Nay, she hath given me
frequent hints not to cultivate the acquaintance. What do you think,
my dear? I should be very sorry to contract an intimacy with a wicked
person."

"Nay, my dear," cries Booth. "I know no more of her, nor indeed hardly
so much as yourself. But this I think, that if Mrs. Ellison knows any
reason why she should not have introduced Mrs. Bennet into your company,
she was very much in the wrong in introducing her into it."

In discourses of this kind they past the remainder of the evening. In
the morning Booth rose early, and, going down-stairs, received from
little Betty a sealed note, which contained the following words:

     Beware, beware, beware;
     For I apprehend a dreadful snare
     Is laid for virtuous innocence,
     Under a friend's false pretence.

Booth immediately enquired of the girl who brought this note? and was
told it came by a chair-man, who, having delivered it, departed without
saying a word.

He was extremely staggered at what he read, and presently referred the
advice to the same affair on which he had received those hints from
Atkinson the preceding evening; but when he came to consider the words
more maturely he could not so well reconcile the two last lines of this
poetical epistle, if it may be so called, with any danger which the law
gave him reason to apprehend. Mr. Murphy and his gang could not well be
said to attack either his innocence or virtue; nor did they attack him
under any colour or pretence of friendship.

After much deliberation on this matter a very strange suspicion came
into his head; and this was, that he was betrayed by Mrs. Ellison.
He had, for some time, conceived no very high opinion of that good
gentlewoman, and he now began to suspect that she was bribed to betray
him. By this means he thought he could best account for the strange
appearance of the supposed madman. And when this conceit once had birth
in his mind, several circumstances nourished and improved it. Among
these were her jocose behaviour and raillery on that occasion, and her
attempt to ridicule his fears from the message which the serjeant had
brought him.

This suspicion was indeed preposterous, and not at all warranted by, or
even consistent with, the character and whole behaviour of Mrs. Ellison,
but it was the only one which at that time suggested itself to his mind;
and, however blameable it might be, it was certainly not unnatural in
him to entertain it; for so great a torment is anxiety to the human
mind, that we always endeavour to relieve ourselves from it by guesses,
however doubtful or uncertain; on all which occasions, dislike and
hatred are the surest guides to lead our suspicion to its object.

When Amelia rose to breakfast, Booth produced the note which he had
received, saying, "My dear, you have so often blamed me for keeping
secrets from you, and I have so often, indeed, endeavoured to conceal
secrets of this kind from you with such ill success, that I think I
shall never more attempt it." Amelia read the letter hastily, and
seemed not a little discomposed; then, turning to Booth with a very
disconsolate countenance, she said, "Sure fortune takes a delight in
terrifying us! what can be the meaning of this?" Then, fixing her eyes
attentively on the paper, she perused it for some time, till Booth
cried, "How is it possible, my Emily, you can read such stuff patiently?
the verses are certainly as bad as ever were written."--"I was trying,
my dear," answered she, "to recollect the hand; for I will take my oath
I have seen it before, and that very lately;" and suddenly she cried
out, with great emotion, "I remember it perfectly now; it is Mrs.
Bennet's hand. Mrs. Ellison shewed me a letter from her but a day or two
ago. It is a very remarkable hand, and I am positive it is hers."

"If it be hers," cries Booth, "what can she possibly mean by the latter
part of her caution? sure Mrs. Ellison hath no intention to betray us."

"I know not what she means," answered Amelia, "but I am resolved to know
immediately, for I am certain of the hand. By the greatest luck in the
world, she told me yesterday where her lodgings were, when she pressed
me exceedingly to come and see her. She lives but a very few doors from
us, and I will go to her this moment."

Booth made not the least objection to his wife's design. His curiosity
was, indeed, as great as hers, and so was his impatience to satisfy it,
though he mentioned not this his impatience to Amelia; and perhaps it
had been well for him if he had.

Amelia, therefore, presently equipped herself in her walking dress, and,
leaving her children to the care of her husband, made all possible haste
to Mrs. Bennet's lodgings.

Amelia waited near five minutes at Mrs. Bennet's door before any one
came to open it; at length a maid servant appeared, who, being asked
if Mrs. Bennet was at home, answered, with some confusion in her
countenance, that she did not know; "but, madam," said she, "if you will
send up your name, I will go and see." Amelia then told her name, and
the wench, after staying a considerable time, returned and acquainted
her that Mrs. Bennet was at home. She was then ushered into a parlour
and told that the lady would wait on her presently.

In this parlour Amelia cooled her heels, as the phrase is, near a
quarter of an hour. She seemed, indeed, at this time, in the miserable
situation of one of those poor wretches who make their morning visits
to the great to solicit favours, or perhaps to solicit the payment of
a debt, for both are alike treated as beggars, and the latter sometimes
considered as the more troublesome beggars of the two.

During her stay here, Amelia observed the house to be in great
confusion; a great bustle was heard above-stairs, and the maid ran up
and down several times in a great hurry.

At length Mrs. Bennet herself came in. She was greatly disordered in
her looks, and had, as the women call it, huddled on her cloaths in much
haste; for, in truth, she was in bed when Amelia first came. Of this
fact she informed her, as the only apology she could make for having
caused her to wait so long for her company.

Amelia very readily accepted her apology, but asked her with a smile,
if these early hours were usual with her? Mrs. Bennet turned as red as
scarlet at the question, and answered, "No, indeed, dear madam. I am for
the most part a very early riser; but I happened accidentally to sit
up very late last night. I am sure I had little expectation of your
intending me such a favour this morning."

Amelia, looking very steadfastly at her, said, "Is it possible, madam,
you should think such a note as this would raise no curiosity in me?"
She then gave her the note, asking her if she did not know the hand.

Mrs. Bennet appeared in the utmost surprize and confusion at this
instant. Indeed, if Amelia had conceived but the slightest suspicion
before, the behaviour of the lady would have been a sufficient
confirmation to her of the truth. She waited not, therefore, for
an answer, which, indeed, the other seemed in no haste to give, but
conjured her in the most earnest manner to explain to her the meaning of
so extraordinary an act of friendship; "for so," said she, "I esteem it,
being convinced you must have sufficient reason for the warning you have
given me."

Mrs. Bennet, after some hesitation, answered, "I need not, I believe,
tell you how much I am surprized at what you have shewn me; and the
chief reason of my surprize is, how you came to discover my hand. Sure,
madam, you have not shewn it to Mrs. Ellison?"

Amelia declared she had not, but desired she would question her no
farther. "What signifies how I discovered it, since your hand it
certainly is?"

"I own it is," cries Mrs. Bennet, recovering her spirits, "and since
you have not shewn it to that woman I am satisfied. I begin to guess
now whence you might have your information; but no matter; I wish I had
never done anything of which I ought to be more ashamed. No one can, I
think, justly accuse me of a crime on that account; and I thank Heaven
my shame will never be directed by the false opinion of the world.
Perhaps it was wrong to shew my letter, but when I consider all
circumstances I can forgive it."

"Since you have guessed the truth," said Amelia, "I am not obliged to
deny it. She, indeed, shewed me your letter, but I am sure you have not
the least reason to be ashamed of it. On the contrary, your behaviour on
so melancholy an occasion was highly praiseworthy; and your bearing
up under such afflictions as the loss of a husband in so dreadful a
situation was truly great and heroical."

"So Mrs. Ellison then hath shewn you my letter?" cries Mrs. Bennet
eagerly.

"Why, did not you guess it yourself?" answered Amelia; "otherwise I am
sure I have betrayed my honour in mentioning it. I hope you have not
drawn me inadvertently into any breach of my promise. Did you not
assert, and that with an absolute certainty, that you knew she had shewn
me your letter, and that you was not angry with her for so doing?"

"I am so confused," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that I scarce know what I say;
yes, yes, I remember I did say so--I wish I had no greater reason to be
angry with her than that."

"For Heaven's sake," cries Amelia, "do not delay my request any longer;
what you say now greatly increases my curiosity, and my mind will be on
the rack till you discover your whole meaning; for I am more and more
convinced that something of the utmost importance was the purport of
your message."

"Of the utmost importance, indeed," cries Mrs. Bennet; "at least you
will own my apprehensions were sufficiently well founded. O gracious
Heaven! how happy shall I think myself if I should have proved your
preservation! I will, indeed, explain my meaning; but, in order to
disclose all my fears in their just colours, I must unfold my whole
history to you. Can you have patience, madam, to listen to the story of
the most unfortunate of women?"

Amelia assured her of the highest attention, and Mrs. Bennet soon after
began to relate what is written in the seventh book of this history.




BOOK VII.



Chapter i.

_A very short chapter, and consequently requiring no preface._


Mrs. Bennet having fastened the door, and both the ladies having taken
their places, she once or twice offered to speak, when passion stopt
her utterance; and, after a minute's silence, she burst into a flood of
tears. Upon which Amelia, expressing the utmost tenderness for her, as
well by her look as by her accent, cried, "What can be the reason, dear
madam, of all this emotion?" "O, Mrs. Booth!" answered she, "I find I
have undertaken what I am not able to perform. You would not wonder at
my emotion if you knew you had an adulteress and a murderer now standing
before you."

Amelia turned pale as death at these words, which Mrs. Bennet observing,
collected all the force she was able, and, a little composing her
countenance, cried, "I see, madam, I have terrified you with such
dreadful words; but I hope you will not think me guilty of these
crimes in the blackest degree." "Guilty!" cries Amelia. "O Heavens!" "I
believe, indeed, your candour," continued Mrs. Bennet, "will be readier
to acquit me than I am to acquit myself. Indiscretion, at least, the
highest, most unpardonable indiscretion, I shall always lay to ray own
charge: and, when I reflect on the fatal consequences, I can never,
never forgive myself." Here she again began to lament in so bitter
a manner, that Amelia endeavoured, as much as she could (for she was
herself greatly shocked), to soothe and comfort her; telling her that,
if indiscretion was her highest crime, the unhappy consequences made
her rather an unfortunate than a guilty person; and concluded by
saying--"Indeed, madam, you have raised my curiosity to the highest
pitch, and I beg you will proceed with your story."

Mrs. Bennet then seemed a second time going to begin her relation,
when she cried out, "I would, if possible, tire you with no more of my
unfortunate life than just with that part which leads to a catastrophe
in which I think you may yourself be interested; but I protest I am at a
loss where to begin."

"Begin wherever you please, dear madam," cries Amelia; "but I beg you
will consider my impatience." "I do consider it," answered Mrs. Bennet;
"and therefore would begin with that part of my story which leads
directly to what concerns yourself; for how, indeed, should my life
produce anything worthy your notice?" "Do not say so, madam," cries
Amelia; "I assure you I have long suspected there were some very
remarkable incidents in your life, and have only wanted an opportunity
to impart to you my desire of hearing them: I beg, therefore, you would
make no more apologies." "I will not, madam," cries Mrs. Bennet, "and
yet I would avoid anything trivial; though, indeed, in stories of
distress, especially where love is concerned, many little incidents
may appear trivial to those who have never felt the passion, which, to
delicate minds, are the most interesting part of the whole." "Nay, but,
dear madam," cries Amelia, "this is all preface."

"Well, madam," answered Mrs. Bennet, "I will consider your impatience."
She then rallied all her spirits in the best manner she could, and began
as is written in the next chapter.

And here possibly the reader will blame Mrs. Bennet for taking her story
so far back, and relating so much of her life in which Amelia had no
concern; but, in truth, she was desirous of inculcating a good opinion
of herself, from recounting those transactions where her conduct was
unexceptionable, before she came to the more dangerous and suspicious
part of her character. This I really suppose to have been her intention;
for to sacrifice the time and patience of Amelia at such a season to the
mere love of talking of herself would have been as unpardonable in
her as the bearing it was in Amelia a proof of the most perfect good
breeding.




Chapter ii.

_The beginning of Mrs. Bennet's history._


"I was the younger of two daughters of a clergyman in Essex; of one in
whose praise if I should indulge my fond heart in speaking, I think my
invention could not outgo the reality. He was indeed well worthy of the
cloth he wore; and that, I think, is the highest character a man can
obtain.

"During the first part of my life, even till I reached my sixteenth
year, I can recollect nothing to relate to you. All was one long serene
day, in looking back upon which, as when we cast our eyes on a calm
sea, no object arises to my view. All appears one scene of happiness and
tranquillity.

"On the day, then, when I became sixteen years old, must I begin my
history; for on that day I first tasted the bitterness of sorrow.

"My father, besides those prescribed by our religion, kept five
festivals every year. These were on his wedding-day, and on the birthday
of each of his little family; on these occasions he used to invite two
or three neighbours to his house, and to indulge himself, as he said, in
great excess; for so he called drinking a pint of very small punch; and,
indeed, it might appear excess to one who on other days rarely tasted
any liquor stronger than small beer.

"Upon my unfortunate birthday, then, when we were all in a high degree
of mirth, my mother having left the room after dinner, and staying away
pretty long, my father sent me to see for her. I went according to his
orders; but, though I searched the whole house and called after her
without doors, I could neither see nor hear her. I was a little alarmed
at this (though far from suspecting any great mischief had befallen
her), and ran back to acquaint my father, who answered coolly (for he
was a man of the calmest temper), 'Very well, my dear, I suppose she is
not gone far, and will be here immediately.' Half an hour or more past
after this, when, she not returning, my father himself expressed some
surprize at her stay; declaring it must be some matter of importance
which could detain her at that time from her company. His surprize
now encreased every minute, and he began to grow uneasy, and to shew
sufficient symptoms in his countenance of what he felt within. He then
despatched the servant-maid to enquire after her mistress in the parish,
but waited not her return; for she was scarce gone out of doors before
he begged leave of his guests to go himself on the same errand. The
company now all broke up, and attended my father, all endeavouring to
give him hopes that no mischief had happened. They searched the whole
parish, but in vain; they could neither see my mother, nor hear any news
of her. My father returned home in a state little short of distraction.
His friends in vain attempted to administer either advice or comfort; he
threw himself on the floor in the most bitter agonies of despair.

"Whilst he lay in this condition, my sister and myself lying by him, all
equally, I believe, and completely miserable, our old servant-maid came
into the room and cried out, her mind misgave her that she knew where
her mistress was. Upon these words, my father sprung from the floor,
and asked her eagerly, where? But oh! Mrs. Booth, how can I describe the
particulars of a scene to you, the remembrance of which chills my blood
with horror, and which the agonies of my mind, when it past, made all a
scene of confusion! The fact then in short was this: my mother, who was
a most indulgent mistress to one servant, which was all we kept, was
unwilling, I suppose, to disturb her at her dinner, and therefore went
herself to fill her tea-kettle at a well, into which, stretching herself
too far, as we imagine, the water then being very low, she fell with the
tea-kettle in her hand. The missing this gave the poor old wretch the
first hint of her suspicion, which, upon examination, was found to be
too well grounded.

"What we all suffered on this occasion may more easily be felt than
described."----"It may indeed," answered Amelia, "and I am so sensible of
it, that, unless you have a mind to see me faint before your face, I
beg you will order me something; a glass of water, if you please. "Mrs.
Bennet immediately complied with her friend's request; a glass of water
was brought, and some hartshorn drops infused into it; which Amelia
having drank off, declared she found herself much better; and then Mrs.
Bennet proceeded thus:--"I will not dwell on a scene which I see hath
already so much affected your tender heart, and which is as disagreeable
to me to relate as it can be to you to hear. I will therefore only
mention to you the behaviour of my father on this occasion, which was
indeed becoming a philosopher and a Christian divine. On the day after
my mother's funeral he sent for my sister and myself into his room,
where, after many caresses and every demonstration of fatherly
tenderness as well in silence as in words, he began to exhort us to bear
with patience the great calamity that had befallen us; saying, 'That as
every human accident, how terrible soever, must happen to us by divine
permission at least, a due sense of our duty to our great Creator must
teach us an absolute submission to his will. Not only religion, but
common sense, must teach us this; for oh! my dear children,' cries he,
'how vain is all resistance, all repining! could tears wash back again
my angel from the grave, I should drain all the juices of my body
through my eyes; but oh, could we fill up that cursed well with our
tears, how fruitless would be all our sorrow!'--I think I repeat you
his very words; for the impression they made on me is never to be
obliterated. He then proceeded to comfort us with the chearful thought
that the loss was entirely our own, and that my mother was greatly a
gainer by the accident which we lamented. 'I have a wife,' cries he,
'my children, and you have a mother, now amongst the heavenly choir;
how selfish therefore is all our grief! how cruel to her are all our
wishes!' In this manner he talked to us near half an hour, though I must
frankly own to you his arguments had not the immediate good effect on us
which they deserved, for we retired from him very little the better for
his exhortations; however, they became every day more and more forcible
upon our recollection; indeed, they were greatly strengthened by his
example; for in this, as in all other instances, he practised the
doctrines which he taught. From this day he never mentioned my mother
more, and soon after recovered his usual chearfulness in public; though
I have reason to think he paid many a bitter sigh in private to that
remembrance which neither philosophy nor Christianity could expunge.

"My father's advice, enforced by his example, together with the kindness
of some of our friends, assisted by that ablest of all the mental
physicians, Time, in a few months pretty well restored my tranquillity,
when fortune made a second attack on my quiet. My sister, whom I dearly
loved, and who as warmly returned my affection, had fallen into an
ill state of health some time before the fatal accident which I have
related. She was indeed at that time so much better, that we had great
hopes of her perfect recovery; but the disorders of her mind on that
dreadful occasion so affected her body, that she presently relapsed to
her former declining state, and thence grew continually worse and worse,
till, after a decay of near seven months, she followed my poor mother to
the grave.

"I will not tire you, dear madam, with repetitions of grief; I will only
mention two observations which have occurred to me from reflections
on the two losses I have mentioned. The first is, that a mind once
violently hurt grows, as it were, callous to any future impressions of
grief, and is never capable of feeling the same pangs a second time. The
other observation is, that the arrows of fortune, as well as all others,
derive their force from the velocity with which they are discharged;
for, when they approach you by slow and perceptible degrees, they have
but very little power to do you mischief.

"The truth of these observations I experienced, not only in my own
heart, but in the behaviour of my father, whose philosophy seemed to
gain a complete triumph over this latter calamity.

"Our family was now reduced to two, and my father grew extremely fond of
me, as if he had now conferred an entire stock of affection on me, that
had before been divided. His words, indeed, testified no less, for
he daily called me his only darling, his whole comfort, his all. He
committed the whole charge of his house to my care, and gave me the name
of his little housekeeper, an appellation of which I was then as proud
as any minister of state can be of his titles. But, though I was very
industrious in the discharge of my occupation, I did not, however,
neglect my studies, in which I had made so great a proficiency, that I
was become a pretty good mistress of the Latin language, and had made
some progress in the Greek. I believe, madam, I have formerly acquainted
you, that learning was the chief estate I inherited of my father, in
which he had instructed me from my earliest youth.

"The kindness of this good man had at length wiped off the remembrance
of all losses; and I during two years led a life of great tranquillity,
I think I might almost say of perfect happiness.

"I was now in the nineteenth year of my age, when my father's good
fortune removed us from the county of Essex into Hampshire, where a
living was conferred on him by one of his old school-fellows, of twice
the value of what he was before possessed of.

"His predecessor in this new living had died in very indifferent
circumstances, and had left behind him a widow with two small children.
My father, therefore, who, with great economy, had a most generous soul,
bought the whole furniture of the parsonage-house at a very high
price; some of it, indeed, he would have wanted; for, though our little
habitation in Essex was most completely furnished, yet it bore no
proportion to the largeness of that house in which he was now to dwell.

"His motive, however, to the purchase was, I am convinced, solely
generosity; which appeared sufficiently by the price he gave, and may
be farther inforced by the kindness he shewed the widow in another
instance; for he assigned her an apartment for the use of herself and
her little family, which, he told her, she was welcome to enjoy as long
as it suited her conveniency.

"As this widow was very young, and generally thought to be tolerably
pretty, though I own she had a cast with her eyes which I never liked,
my father, you may suppose, acted from a less noble principle than I
have hinted; but I must in justice acquit him, for these kind offers
were made her before ever he had seen her face; and I have the greatest
reason to think that, for a long time after he had seen her, he beheld
her with much indifference.

"This act of my father's gave me, when I first heard it, great
satisfaction; for I may at least, with the modesty of the ancient
philosophers, call myself a lover of generosity, but when I became
acquainted with the widow I was still more delighted with what my father
had done; for though I could not agree with those who thought her a
consummate beauty, I must allow that she was very fully possessed of the
power of making herself agreeable; and this power she exerted with so
much success, with such indefatigable industry to oblige, that within
three months I became in the highest manner pleased with my new
acquaintance, and had contracted the most sincere friendship for her.

"But, if I was so pleased with the widow, my father was by this time
enamoured of her. She had, indeed, by the most artful conduct in the
world, so insinuated herself into his favour, so entirely infatuated
him, that he never shewed the least marks of chearfulness in her
absence, and could, in truth, scarce bear that she should be out of his
sight.

"She had managed this matter so well (O, she is the most artful of
women!) that my father's heart was gone before I ever suspected it
was in danger. The discovery you may easily believe, madam, was not
pleasing. The name of a mother-in-law sounded dreadful in my ears; nor
could I bear the thought of parting again with a share in those dear
affections, of which I had purchased the whole by the loss of a beloved
mother and sister.

"In the first hurry and disorder of my mind on this occasion I committed
a crime of the highest kind against all the laws of prudence and
discretion. I took the young lady herself very roundly to task, treated
her designs on my father as little better than a design to commit a
theft, and in my passion, I believe, said she might be ashamed to think
of marrying a man old enough to be her grandfather; for so in reality he
almost was.

"The lady on this occasion acted finely the part of a hypocrite. She
affected to be highly affronted at my unjust suspicions, as she called
them; and proceeded to such asseverations of her innocence, that she
almost brought me to discredit the evidence of my own eyes and ears.

"My father, however, acted much more honestly, for he fell the next day
into a more violent passion with me than I had ever seen him in before,
and asked me whether I intended to return his paternal fondness by
assuming the right of controlling his inclinations? with more of the
like kind, which fully convinced me what had passed between him and the
lady, and how little I had injured her in my suspicions.

"Hitherto, I frankly own, my aversion to this match had been principally
on my own account; for I had no ill opinion of the woman, though I
thought neither her circumstances nor my father's age promised any
kind of felicity from such an union; but now I learnt some particulars,
which, had not our quarrel become public in the parish, I should perhaps
have never known. In short, I was Informed that this gentle obliging
creature, as she had at first appeared to me, had the spirit of a
tigress, and was by many believed to have broken the heart of her first
husband.

"The truth of this matter being confirmed to me upon examination, I
resolved not to suppress it. On this occasion fortune seemed to favour
me, by giving me a speedy opportunity of seeing my father alone and in
good humour. He now first began to open his intended marriage, telling
me that he had formerly had some religious objections to bigamy, but he
had very fully considered the matter, and had satisfied himself of its
legality. He then faithfully promised me that no second marriage should
in the least impair his affection for me; and concluded with the highest
eulogiums on the goodness of the widow, protesting that it was her
virtues and not her person with which he was enamoured.

"I now fell upon my knees before him, and bathing his hand in my tears,
which flowed very plentifully from my eyes, acquainted him with all I
had heard, and was so very imprudent, I might almost say so cruel, to
disclose the author of my information.

"My father heard me without any indication of passion, and answered
coldly, that if there was any proof of such facts he should decline any
further thoughts of this match: 'But, child,' said he, 'though I am far
from suspecting the truth of what you tell me, as far as regards your
knowledge, yet you know the inclination of the world to slander.'
However, before we parted he promised to make a proper enquiry into
what I had told him.--But I ask your pardon, dear madam, I am running
minutely into those particulars of my life in which you have not the
least concern."

Amelia stopt her friend short in her apology; and though, perhaps, she
thought her impertinent enough, yet (such was her good breeding) she
gave her many assurances of a curiosity to know every incident of her
life which she could remember; after which Mrs. Bennet proceeded as in
the next chapter.




Chapter iii.

_Continuation of Mrs. Bennet's story._


"I think, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, "I told you my father promised me
to enquire farther into the affair, but he had hardly time to keep his
word; for we separated pretty late in the evening and early the next
morning he was married to the widow.

"But, though he gave no credit to my information, I had sufficient
reason to think he did not forget it, by the resentment which he soon
discovered to both the persons whom I had named as my informers.

"Nor was it long before I had good cause to believe that my father's new
wife was perfectly well acquainted with the good opinion I had of her,
not only from her usage of me, but from certain hints which she threw
forth with an air of triumph. One day, particularly, I remember she said
to my father, upon his mentioning his age, 'O, my dear! I hope you have
many years yet to live! unless, indeed, I should be so cruel as to
break your heart' She spoke these words looking me full in the face, and
accompanied them with a sneer in which the highest malice was visible,
under a thin covering of affected pleasantry.

"I will not entertain you, madam, with anything so common as the cruel
usage of a step-mother; nor of what affected me much more, the unkind
behaviour of a father under such an influence. It shall suffice only to
tell you that I had the mortification to perceive the gradual and
daily decrease of my father's affection. His smiles were converted into
frowns; the tender appellations of child and dear were exchanged for
plain Molly, that girl, that creature, and sometimes much harder names.
I was at first turned all at once into a cypher, and at last seemed to
be considered as a nuisance in the family.

"Thus altered was the man of whom I gave you such a character at
the entrance on my story; but, alas! he no longer acted from his own
excellent disposition, but was in everything governed and directed by
my mother-in-law. In fact, whenever there is great disparity of years
between husband and wife, the younger is, I believe, always possessed
of absolute power over the elder; for superstition itself is a less firm
support of absolute power than dotage.

"But, though his wife was so entirely mistress of my father's will that
she could make him use me ill, she could not so perfectly subdue his
understanding as to prevent him from being conscious of such ill-usage;
and from this consciousness, he began inveterately to hate me. Of this
hatred he gave me numberless instances, and I protest to you I know not
any other reason for it than what I have assigned; and the cause, as
experience hath convinced me, is adequate to the effect.

"While I was in this wretched situation, my father's unkindness having
almost broken ray heart, he came one day into my room with more anger in
his countenance than I had ever seen, and, after bitterly upbraiding me
with my undutiful behaviour both to himself and his worthy consort, he
bid me pack up my alls, and immediately prepare to quit his house; at
the same time gave me a letter, and told me that would acquaint me where
I might find a home; adding that he doubted not but I expected, and had
indeed solicited, the invitation; and left me with a declaration that he
would have no spies in his family.

"The letter, I found on opening it, was from my father's own sister;
but before I mention the contents I will give you a short sketch of her
character, as it was somewhat particular. Her personal charms were not
great; for she was very tall, very thin, and very homely. Of the
defect of her beauty she was, perhaps, sensible; her vanity, therefore,
retreated into her mind, where there is no looking-glass, and
consequently where we can flatter ourselves with discovering almost
whatever beauties we please. This is an encouraging circumstance; and
yet I have observed, dear Mrs. Booth, that few women ever seek these
comforts from within till they are driven to it by despair of finding
any food for their vanity from without. Indeed, I believe the first wish
of our whole sex is to be handsome."

Here both the ladies fixed their eyes on the glass, and both smiled.

"My aunt, however," continued Mrs. Bennet, "from despair of gaining any
applause this way, had applied herself entirely to the contemplation of
her understanding, and had improved this to such a pitch, that at the
age of fifty, at which she was now arrived, she had contracted a hearty
contempt for much the greater part of both sexes; for the women, as
being idiots, and for the men, as the admirers of idiots. That word, and
fool, were almost constantly in her mouth, and were bestowed with great
liberality among all her acquaintance.

"This lady had spent one day only at my father's house in near two
years; it was about a month before his second marriage. At her departure
she took occasion to whisper me her opinion of the widow, whom she
called a pretty idiot, and wondered how her brother could bear such
company under his roof; for neither she nor I had at that time any
suspicion of what afterwards happened.

"The letter which my father had just received, and which was the first
she had sent him since his marriage, was of such a nature that I should
be unjust if I blamed him for being offended; fool and idiot were both
plentifully bestowed in it as well on himself as on his wife. But what,
perhaps, had principally offended him was that part which related to
me; for, after much panegyric on my understanding, and saying he was
unworthy of such a daughter, she considered his match not only as the
highest indiscretion as it related to himself, but as a downright act
of injustice to me. One expression in it I shall never forget. 'You have
placed,' said she, 'a woman above your daughter, who, in understanding,
the only valuable gift of nature, is the lowest in the whole class of
pretty idiots.' After much more of this kind, it concluded with inviting
me to her house.

"I can truly say that when I had read the letter I entirely forgave my
father's suspicion that I had made some complaints to my aunt of his
behaviour; for, though I was indeed innocent, there was surely colour
enough to suspect the contrary.

"Though I had never been greatly attached to my aunt, nor indeed had
she formerly given me any reason for such an attachment, yet I was well
enough pleased with her present invitation. To say the truth, I led so
wretched a life where I then was, that it was impossible not to be a
gainer by any exchange.

"I could not, however, bear the thoughts of leaving my father with
an impression on his mind against me which I did not deserve. I
endeavoured, therefore, to remove all his suspicion of my having
complained to my aunt by the most earnest asseverations of my innocence;
but they were all to no purpose. All my tears, all my vows, and all
my entreaties were fruitless. My new mother, indeed, appeared to be
my advocate; but she acted her part very poorly, and, far from
counterfeiting any desire of succeeding in my suit, she could not
conceal the excessive joy which she felt on the occasion.

"Well, madam, the next day I departed for my aunt's, where, after a long
journey of forty miles, I arrived, without having once broke my fast on
the road; for grief is as capable as food of filling the stomach, and I
had too much of the former to admit any of the latter. The fatigue of
my journey, and the agitation of my mind, joined to my fasting,
so overpowered my spirits, that when I was taken from my horse I
immediately fainted away in the arms of the man who helped me from
my saddle. My aunt expressed great astonishment at seeing me in this
condition, with my eyes almost swollen out of my head with tears; but
my father's letter, which I delivered her soon after I came to myself,
pretty well, I believe, cured her surprize. She often smiled with a
mixture of contempt and anger while she was reading it; and, having
pronounced her brother to be a fool, she turned to me, and, with as much
affability as possible (for she is no great mistress of affability),
said, 'Don't be uneasy, dear Molly, for you are come to the house of a
friend--of one who hath sense enough to discern the author of all the
mischief: depend upon it, child, I will, ere long, make some people
ashamed of their folly.' This kind reception gave me some comfort, my
aunt assuring me that she would convince him how unjustly he had accused
me of having made any complaints to her. A paper war was now begun
between these two, which not only fixed an irreconcileable hatred
between them, but confirmed my father's displeasure against me; and, in
the end, I believe, did me no service with my aunt; for I was
considered by both as the cause of their dissension, though, in fact,
my stepmother, who very well knew the affection my aunt had for her,
had long since done her business with my father; and as for my aunt's
affection towards him, it had been abating several years, from
an apprehension that he did not pay sufficient deference to her
understanding.

"I had lived about half a year with my aunt when I heard of my
stepmother's being delivered of a boy, and the great joy my father
expressed on that occasion; but, poor man, he lived not long to enjoy
his happiness; for within a month afterwards I had the melancholy news
of his death.

"Notwithstanding all the disobligations I had lately received from him,
I was sincerely afflicted at my loss of him. All his kindness to me in
my infancy, all his kindness to me while I was growing up, recurred
to my memory, raised a thousand tender, melancholy ideas, and totally
obliterated all thoughts of his latter behaviour, for which I made also
every allowance and every excuse in my power.

"But what may perhaps appear more extraordinary, my aunt began soon to
speak of him with concern. She said he had some understanding formerly,
though his passion for that vile woman had, in a great measure, obscured
it; and one day, when she was in an ill-humour with me, she had the
cruelty to throw out a hint that she had never quarrelled with her
brother if it had not been on my account." My father, during his life,
had allowed my aunt very handsomely for my board; for generosity was too
deeply riveted in his nature to be plucked out by all the power of his
wife. So far, however, she prevailed, that, though he died possessed of
upwards of L2000, he left me no more than L100, which, as he expressed
in his will, was to set me up in some business, if I had the grace to
take to any.

"Hitherto my aunt had in general treated me with some degree of
affection; but her behaviour began now to be changed. She soon took an
opportunity of giving me to understand that her fortune was insufficient
to keep me; and, as I could not live on the interest of my own, it was
high time for me to consider about going into the world. She added, that
her brother having mentioned my setting up in some business in his will
was very foolish; that I had been bred to nothing; and, besides, that
the sum was too trifling to set me up in any way of reputation; she
desired me therefore to think of immediately going into service.

"This advice was perhaps right enough; and I told her I was very ready
to do as she directed me, but I was at that time in an ill state of
health; I desired her therefore to let me stay with her till my legacy,
which was not to be paid till a year after my father's death, was due;
and I then promised to satisfy her for my board, to which she readily
consented.

"And now, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, sighing, "I am going to open to you
those matters which lead directly to that great catastrophe of my life
which hath occasioned my giving you this trouble, and of trying your
patience in this manner."

Amelia, notwithstanding her impatience, made a very civil answer to
this; and then Mrs. Bennet proceeded to relate what is written in the
next chapter.




Chapter iv.

_Further continuation._


"The curate of the parish where my aunt dwelt was a young fellow of
about four-and-twenty. He had been left an orphan in his infancy, and
entirely unprovided for, when an uncle had the goodness to take care
of his education, both at school and at the university. As the young
gentleman was intended for the church, his uncle, though he had two
daughters of his own, and no very large fortune, purchased for him the
next presentation of a living of near L200 a-year. The incumbent, at the
time of the purchase, was under the age of sixty, and in apparent good
health; notwithstanding which, he died soon after the bargain, and long
before the nephew was capable of orders; so that the uncle was obliged
to give the living to a clergyman, to hold it till the young man came of
proper age.

"The young gentleman had not attained his proper age of taking orders
when he had the misfortune to lose his uncle and only friend, who,
thinking he had sufficiently provided for his nephew by the purchase of
the living, considered him no farther in his will, but divided all
the fortune of which he died possessed between his two daughters;
recommending it to them, however, on his deathbed, to assist their
cousin with money sufficient to keep him at the university till he
should be capable of ordination.

"But, as no appointment of this kind was in the will, the young ladies,
who received about each, thought proper to disregard the last words of
their father; for, besides that both of them were extremely tenacious
of their money, they were great enemies to their cousin, on account of
their father's kindness to him; and thought proper to let him know that
they thought he had robbed them of too much already.

"The poor young fellow was now greatly distrest; for he had yet above a
year to stay at the university, without any visible means of sustaining
himself there.

"In this distress, however, he met with a friend, who had the good
nature to lend him the sum of twenty pounds, for which he only accepted
his bond for forty, and which was to be paid within a year after his
being possessed of his living; that is, within a year after his becoming
qualified to hold it.

"With this small sum thus hardly obtained the poor gentleman made a
shift to struggle with all difficulties till he became of due age to
take upon himself the character of a deacon. He then repaired to that
clergyman to whom his uncle had given the living upon the conditions
above mentioned, to procure a title to ordination; but this, to his
great surprize and mortification, was absolutely refused him.

"The immediate disappointment did not hurt him so much as the conclusion
he drew from it; for he could have but little hopes that the man who
could have the cruelty to refuse him a title would vouchsafe afterwards
to deliver up to him a living of so considerable a value; nor was it
long before this worthy incumbent told him plainly that he valued his
uncle's favours at too high a rate to part with them to any one; nay,
he pretended scruples of conscience, and said that, if he had made any
slight promises, which he did not now well remember, they were wicked
and void; that he looked upon himself as married to his parish, and he
could no more give it up than he could give up his wife without sin.

"The poor young fellow was now obliged to seek farther for a title,
which, at length, he obtained from the rector of the parish where my
aunt lived.

"He had not long been settled in the curacy before an intimate
acquaintance grew between him and my aunt; for she was a great admirer
of the clergy, and used frequently to say they were the only conversible
creatures in the country.

"The first time she was in this gentleman's company was at a neighbour's
christening, where she stood godmother. Here she displayed her whole
little stock of knowledge, in order to captivate Mr. Bennet (I suppose,
madam, you already guess that to have been his name), and before they
parted gave him a very strong invitation to her house.

"Not a word passed at this christening between Mr. Bennet and myself,
but our eyes were not unemployed. Here, madam, I first felt a pleasing
kind of confusion, which I know not how to describe. I felt a kind of
uneasiness, yet did not wish to be without it. I longed to be alone,
yet dreaded the hour of parting. I could not keep my eyes off from the
object which caused my confusion, and which I was at once afraid of and
enamoured with. But why do I attempt to describe my situation to one who
must, I am sure, have felt the same?"

Amelia smiled, and Mrs. Bennet went on thus: "O, Mrs. Booth! had you
seen the person of whom I am now speaking, you would not condemn the
suddenness of my love. Nay, indeed, I had seen him there before, though
this was the first time I had ever heard the music of his voice. Oh! it
was the sweetest that was ever heard.

"Mr. Bennet came to visit my aunt the very next day. She imputed this
respectful haste to the powerful charms of her understanding, and
resolved to lose no opportunity in improving the opinion which she
imagined he had conceived of her. She became by this desire quite
ridiculous, and ran into absurdities and a gallimatia scarce credible.

"Mr. Bennet, as I afterwards found, saw her in the same light with
myself; but, as he was a very sensible and well-bred man, he so well
concealed his opinion from us both, that I was almost angry, and she
was pleased even to raptures, declarinte himself with that
gentleman of whom Bondum had given so shabby a character. In short, Mr.
Booth's opinion of the bailiff was such, that he recommended a man most
where he least intended it. Nay, the bailiff in the present instance,
though he had drawn a malicious conclusion, honestly avowed that
this was drawn only from the poverty of the person, which is never, I
believe, any forcible disrecommendation to a good mind: but he must have
had a very bad mind indeed, who, in Mr. Booth's circumstances, could
have disliked or despised another man because that other man was poor.

Some previous conversation having past between this gentleman and Booth,
in which they had both opened their several situations to each other,
the former, casting an affectionate look on the latter, exprest great
compassion for his circumstances, for which Booth, thanking him, said,
"You must have a great deal of compassion, and be a very good man, in
such a terrible situation as you describe yourself, to have any pity to
spare for other people."

"My affairs, sir," answered the gentleman, "are very bad, it is true,
and yet there is one circumstance which makes you appear to me more the
object of pity than I am to myself; and it is this--that you must from
your years be a novice in affliction, whereas I have served a long
apprenticeship to misery, and ought, by this time, to be a pretty good
master of my trade. To say the truth, I believe habit teaches men to
bear the burthens of the mind, as it inures them to bear heavy burthens
on their shoulders. Without use and experience, the strongest minds and
bodies both will stagger under a weight which habit might render easy
and even contemptible."

"There is great justice," cries Booth, "in the comparison; and I think
I have myself experienced the truth of it; for I am not that tyro in
affliction which you seem to apprehend me. And perhaps it is from the
very habit you mention that I am able to support my present misfortunes
a little like a man."

The gentleman smiled at this, and cried, "Indeed, captain, you are a
young philosopher."

"I think," cries Booth, "I have some pretensions to that philosophy
which is taught by misfortunes, and you seem to be of opinion, sir, that
is one of the best schools of philosophy."

"I mean no more, sir," said the gentleman, "than that in the days of our
affliction we are inclined to think more seriously than in those seasons
of life when we are engaged in the hurrying pursuits of business or
pleasure, when we have neither leisure nor inclination to sift and
examine things to the bottom. Now there are two considerations which,
from my having long fixed my thoughts upon them, have greatly supported
me under all my afflictions. The one is the brevity of life even at its
longest duration, which the wisest of men hath compared to the short
dimension of a span. One of the Roman poets compares it to the duration
of a race; and another, to the much shorter transition of a wave.

"The second consideration is the uncertainty of it. Short as its utmost
limits are, it is far from being assured of reaching those limits. The
next day, the next hour, the next moment, may be the end of our course.
Now of what value is so uncertain, so precarious a station? This
consideration, indeed, however lightly it is passed over in our
conception, doth, in a great measure, level all fortunes and conditions,
and gives no man a right to triumph in the happiest state, or any reason
to repine in the most miserable. Would the most worldly men see this in
the light in which they examine all other matters, they would soon feel
and acknowledge the force of this way of reasoning; for which of them
would give any price for an estate from which they were liable to be
immediately ejected? or, would they not laugh at him as a madman who
accounted himself rich from such an uncertain possession? This is the
fountain, sir, from which I have drawn my philosophy. Hence it is that I
have learnt to look on all those things which are esteemed the blessings
of life, and those which are dreaded as its evils, with such a degree of
indifference that, as I should not be elated with possessing the former,
so neither am I greatly dejected and depressed by suffering the
latter. Is the actor esteemed happier to whose lot it falls to play the
principal part than he who plays the lowest? and yet the drama may run
twenty nights together, and by consequence may outlast our lives; but,
at the best, life is only a little longer drama, and the business of
the great stage is consequently a little more serious than that which
is performed at the Theatre-royal. But even here, the catastrophes and
calamities which are represented are capable of affecting us. The wisest
men can deceive themselves into feeling the distresses of a tragedy,
though they know them to be merely imaginary; and the children will
often lament them as realities: what wonder then, if these tragical
scenes which I allow to be a little more serious, should a little
more affect us? where then is the remedy but in the philosophy I have
mentioned, which, when once by a long course of meditation it is reduced
to a habit, teaches us to set a just value on everything, and cures
at once all eager wishes and abject fears, all violent joy and grief
concerning objects which cannot endure long, and may not exist a
moment."

"You have exprest yourself extremely well," cries Booth; "and I entirely
agree with the justice of your sentiments; but, however true all this
may be in theory, I still doubt its efficacy in practice. And the cause
of the difference between these two is this; that we reason from our
heads, but act from our hearts:

      _---Video meliora, proboque;
         Deteriora sequor._

Nothing can differ more widely than wise men and fools in their
estimation of things; but, as both act from their uppermost passion,
they both often act like. What comfort then can your philosophy give to
an avaricious man who is deprived of his riches or to an ambitious
man who is stript of his power? to the fond lover who is torn from his
mistress or to the tender husband who is dragged from his wife? Do you
really think that any meditations on the shortness of life will soothe
them in their afflictions? Is not this very shortness itself one
of their afflictions? and if the evil they suffer be a temporary
deprivation of what they love, will they not think their fate the
harder, and lament the more, that they are to lose any part of an
enjoyment to which there is so short and so uncertain a period?"

"I beg leave, sir," said the gentleman, "to distinguish here. By
philosophy, I do not mean the bare knowledge of right and wrong, but an
energy, a habit, as Aristotle calls it; and this I do firmly believe,
with him and with the Stoics, is superior to all the attacks of
fortune."

He was proceeding when the bailiff came in, and in a surly tone bad
them both good-morrow; after which he asked the philosopher if he was
prepared to go to Newgate; for that he must carry him thither that
afternoon.

The poor man seemed very much shocked with this news. "I hope," cries
he, "you will give a little longer time, if not till the return of the
writ. But I beg you particularly not to carry me thither to-day, for I
expect my wife and children here in the evening."

"I have nothing to do with wives and children," cried the bailiff;
"I never desire to see any wives and children here. I like no such
company."

"I intreat you," said the prisoner, "give me another day. I shall take
it as a great obligation; and you will disappoint me in the cruellest
manner in the world if you refuse me."

"I can't help people's disappointments," cries the bailiff; "I must
consider myself and my own family. I know not where I shall be paid the
money that's due already. I can't afford to keep prisoners at my own
expense."

"I don't intend it shall be at your expense" cries the philosopher; "my
wife is gone to raise money this morning; and I hope to pay you all I
owe you at her arrival. But we intend to sup together to-night at your
house; and, if you should remove me now, it would be the most barbarous
disappointment to us both, and will make me the most miserable man
alive."

"Nay, for my part," said the bailiff, "I don't desire to do anything
barbarous. I know how to treat gentlemen with civility as well as
another. And when people pay as they go, and spend their money like
gentlemen, I am sure nobody can accuse me of any incivility since I have
been in the office. And if you intend to be merry to-night I am not the
man that will prevent it. Though I say it, you may have as good a supper
drest here as at any tavern in town."

"Since Mr. Bondum is so kind, captain," said the philosopher, "I hope
for the favour of your company. I assure you, if it ever be my fortune
to go abroad into the world, I shall be proud of the honour of your
acquaintance."

"Indeed, sir," cries Booth, "it is an honour I shall be very ready
to accept; but as for this evening, I cannot help saying I hope to be
engaged in another place."

"I promise you, sir," answered the other, "I shall rejoice at your
liberty, though I am a loser by it."

"Why, as to that matter," cries Bondum with a sneer, "I fancy, captain,
you may engage yourself to the gentleman without any fear of breaking
your word; for I am very much mistaken if we part to-day."

"Pardon me, my good friend," said Booth, "but I expect my bail every
minute."

"Lookee, sir," cries Bondum, "I don't love to see gentlemen in an error.
I shall not take the serjeant's bail; and as for the colonel, I have
been with him myself this morning (for to be sure I love to do all I
can for gentlemen), and he told me he could not possibly be here to-day;
besides, why should I mince the matter? there is more stuff in the
office."

"What do you mean by stuff?" cries Booth.

"I mean that there is another writ," answered the bailiff, "at the
suit of Mrs. Ellison, the gentlewoman that was here yesterday; and the
attorney that was with her is concerned against you. Some officers would
not tell you all this; but I loves to shew civility to gentlemen while
they behave themselves as such. And I loves the gentlemen of the army in
particular. I had like to have been in the army myself once; but I liked
the commission I have better. Come, captain, let not your noble courage
be cast down; what say you to a glass of white wine, or a tiff of punch,
by way of whet?"

"I have told you, sir, I never drink in the morning," cries Booth a
little peevishly.

"No offence I hope, sir," said the bailiff; "I hope I have not treated
you with any incivility. I don't ask any gentleman to call for liquor
in my house if he doth not chuse it; nor I don't desire anybody to stay
here longer than they have a mind to. Newgate, to be sure, is the place
for all debtors that can't find bail. I knows what civility is, and I
scorn to behave myself unbecoming a gentleman: but I'd have you consider
that the twenty-four hours appointed by act of parliament are almost
out; and so it is time to think of removing. As to bail, I would not
have you flatter yourself; for I knows very well there are other things
coming against you. Besides, the sum you are already charged with is
very large, and I must see you in a place of safety. My house is no
prison, though I lock up for a little time in it. Indeed, when gentlemen
are gentlemen, and likely to find bail, I don't stand for a day or two;
but I have a good nose at a bit of carrion, captain; I have not carried
so much carrion to Newgate, without knowing the smell of it."

"I understand not your cant," cries Booth; "but I did not think to have
offended you so much by refusing to drink in a morning."

"Offended me, sir!" cries the bailiff. "Who told you so? Do you think,
sir, if I want a glass of wine I am under any necessity of asking my
prisoners for it? Damn it, sir, I'll shew you I scorn your words. I can
afford to treat you with a glass of the best wine in England, if you
comes to that." He then pulled out a handful of guineas, saying, "There,
sir, they are all my own; I owe nobody a shilling. I am no beggar, nor
no debtor. I am the king's officer as well as you, and I will spend
guinea for guinea as long as you please."

"Harkee, rascal," cries Booth, laying hold of the bailiff's collar.
"How dare you treat me with this insolence? doth the law give you any
authority to insult me in my misfortunes?" At which words he gave the
bailiff a good shove, and threw him from him.

"Very well, sir," cries the bailiff; "I will swear both an assault and
an attempt to a rescue. If officers are to be used in this manner, there
is an end of all law and justice. But, though I am not a match for you
myself, I have those below that are." He then ran to the door and called
up two ill-looking fellows, his followers, whom, as soon as they entered
the room, he ordered to seize on Booth, declaring he would immediately
carry him to Newgate; at the same time pouring out a vast quantity of
abuse, below the dignity of history to record.

Booth desired the two dirty fellows to stand off, and declared he would
make no resistance; at the same time bidding the bailiff carry him
wherever he durst.

"I'll shew you what I dare," cries the bailiff; and again ordered the
followers to lay hold of their prisoner, saying, "He has assaulted me
already, and endeavoured a rescue. I shan't trust such a fellow to walk
at liberty. A gentleman, indeed! ay, ay, Newgate is the properest place
for such gentry; as arrant carrion as ever was carried thither."

The fellows then both laid violent hands on Booth, and the bailiff stept
to the door to order a coach; when, on a sudden, the whole scene was
changed in an instant; for now the serjeant came running out of breath
into the room; and, seeing his friend the captain roughly handled by two
ill-looking fellows, without asking any questions stept briskly up to
his assistance, and instantly gave one of the assailants so violent a
salute with his fist, that he directly measured his length on the floor.

Booth, having by this means his right arm at liberty, was unwilling to
be idle, or entirely to owe his rescue from both the ruffians to the
serjeant; he therefore imitated the example which his friend had
set him, and with a lusty blow levelled the other follower with his
companion on the ground.

The bailiff roared out, "A rescue, a rescue!" to which the serjeant
answered there was no rescue intended. "The captain," said he, "wants
no rescue. Here are some friends coming who will deliver him in a better
manner."

The bailiff swore heartily he would carry him to Newgate in spite of all
the friends in the world.

"You carry him to Newgate!" cried the serjeant, with the highest
indignation. "Offer but to lay your hands on him, and I will knock your
teeth down your ugly jaws." Then, turning to Booth, he cried, "They will
be all here within a minute, sir; we had much ado to keep my lady from
coming herself; but she is at home in good health, longing to see your
honour; and I hope you will be with her within this half-hour."

And now three gentlemen entered the room; these were an attorney, the
person whom the serjeant had procured in the morning to be his bail with
Colonel James, and lastly Doctor Harrison himself.

The bailiff no sooner saw the attorney, with whom he was well acquainted
(for the others he knew not), than he began, as the phrase is, to pull
in his horns, and ordered the two followers, who were now got again on
their legs, to walk down-stairs.

"So, captain," says the doctor, "when last we parted, I believe we
neither of us expected to meet in such a place as this."

"Indeed, doctor," cries Booth, "I did not expect to have been sent
hither by the gentleman who did me that favour."

"How so, sir?" said the doctor; "you was sent hither by some person, I
suppose, to whom you was indebted. This is the usual place, I apprehend,
for creditors to send their debtors to. But you ought to be more
surprized that the gentleman who sent you hither is come to release you.
Mr. Murphy, you will perform all the necessary ceremonials."

The attorney then asked the bailiff with how many actions Booth was
charged, and was informed there were five besides the doctor's, which
was much the heaviest of all. Proper bonds were presently provided, and
the doctor and the serjeant's friend signed them; the bailiff, at the
instance of the attorney, making no objection to the bail.

[Illustration: _Lawyer Murphy_]

Booth, we may be assured, made a handsome speech to the doctor for such
extraordinary friendship, with which, however, we do not think proper
to trouble the reader; and now everything being ended, and the company
ready to depart, the bailiff stepped up to Booth, and told him he hoped
he would remember civility-money.

"I believe" cries Booth, "you mean incivility-money; if there are any
fees due for rudeness, I must own you have a very just claim."

"I am sure, sir," cries the bailiff, "I have treated your honour with
all the respect in the world; no man, I am sure, can charge me with
using a gentleman rudely. I knows what belongs to a gentleman better;
but you can't deny that two of my men have been knocked down; and I
doubt not but, as you are a gentleman, you will give them something to
drink."

Booth was about to answer with some passion, when the attorney
interfered, and whispered in his ear that it was usual to make a
compliment to the officer, and that he had better comply with the
custom.

"If the fellow had treated me civilly," answered Booth, "I should have
had no objection to comply with a bad custom in his favour; but I am
resolved I will never reward a man for using me ill; and I will not
agree to give him a single farthing."

"'Tis very well, sir," said the bailiff; "I am rightly served for my
good-nature; but, if it had been to do again, I would have taken care
you should not have been bailed this day."

Doctor Harrison, to whom Booth referred the cause, after giving him a
succinct account of what had passed, declared the captain to be in the
right. He said it was a most horrid imposition that such fellows were
ever suffered to prey on the necessitous; but that the example would be
much worse to reward them where they had behaved themselves ill. "And I
think," says he, "the bailiff is worthy of great rebuke for what he hath
just now said; in which I hope he hath boasted of more power than is in
him. We do, indeed, with great justice and propriety value ourselves
on our freedom if the liberty of the subject depends on the pleasure of
such fellows as these!"

"It is not so neither altogether," cries the lawyer; "but custom hath
established a present or fee to them at the delivery of a prisoner,
which they call civility-money, and expect as in a manner their due,
though in reality they have no right."

"But will any man," cries Doctor Harrison, "after what the captain hath
told us, say that the bailiff hath behaved himself as he ought; and,
if he had, is he to be rewarded for not acting in an unchristian and
inhuman manner? it is pity that, instead of a custom of feeing them
out of the pockets of the poor and wretched, when they do not behave
themselves ill, there was not both a law and a practice to punish them
severely when they do. In the present case, I am so far from agreeing to
give the bailiff a shilling, that, if there be any method of punishing
him for his rudeness, I shall be heartily glad to see it put in
execution; for there are none whose conduct should be so strictly
watched as that of these necessary evils in the society, as their office
concerns for the most part those poor creatures who cannot do themselves
justice, and as they are generally the worst of men who undertake it."

The bailiff then quitted the room, muttering that he should know better
what to do another time; and shortly after, Booth and his friends left
the house; but, as they were going out, the author took Doctor Harrison
aside, and slipt a receipt into his hand, which the doctor returned,
saying, he never subscribed when he neither knew the work nor the
author; but that, if he would call at his lodgings, he would be very
willing to give all the encouragement to merit which was in his power.

The author took down the doctor's name and direction, and made him as
many bows as he would have done had he carried off the half-guinea for
which he had been fishing.

Mr. Booth then took his leave of the philosopher, and departed with the
rest of his friends.

BOOK IX.



Chapter i.

_In which the history looks backwards._


Before we proceed farther with our history it may be proper to look back
a little, in order to account for the late conduct of Doctor Harrison;
which, however inconsistent it may have hitherto appeared, when examined
to the bottom will be found, I apprehend, to be truly congruous with
all the rules of the most perfect prudence as well as with the most
consummate goodness.

We have already partly seen in what light Booth had been represented to
the doctor abroad. Indeed, the accounts which were sent of the captain,
as well by the curate as by a gentleman of the neighbourhood, were much
grosser and more to his disadvantage than the doctor was pleased to set
them forth in his letter to the person accused. What sense he had of
Booth's conduct was, however, manifest by that letter. Nevertheless, he
resolved to suspend his final judgment till his return; and, though
he censured him, would not absolutely condemn him without ocular
demonstration.

The doctor, on his return to his parish, found all the accusations which
had been transmitted to him confirmed by many witnesses, of which the
curate's wife, who had been formerly a friend to Amelia, and still
preserved the outward appearance of friendship, was the strongest. She
introduced all with--"I am sorry to say it; and it is friendship which
bids me speak; and it is for their good it should be told you." After
which beginnings she never concluded a single speech without some horrid
slander and bitter invective.

Besides the malicious turn which was given to these affairs in the
country, which were owing a good deal to misfortune, and some little
perhaps to imprudence, the whole neighbourhood rung with several gross
and scandalous lies, which were merely the inventions of his enemies,
and of which the scene was laid in London since his absence.

Poisoned with all this malice, the doctor came to town; and, learning
where Booth lodged, went to make him a visit. Indeed, it was the doctor,
and no other, who had been at his lodgings that evening when Booth and
Amelia were walking in the Park, and concerning which the reader may be
pleased to remember so many strange and odd conjectures.

Here the doctor saw the little gold watch and all those fine trinkets
with which the noble lord had presented the children, and which, from
the answers given him by the poor ignorant, innocent girl, he could have
no doubt had been purchased within a few days by Amelia.

This account tallied so well with the ideas he had imbibed of Booth's
extravagance in the country, that he firmly believed both the husband
and wife to be the vainest, silliest, and most unjust people alive. It
was, indeed, almost incredible that two rational beings should be
guilty of such absurdity; but, monstrous and absurd as it was, ocular
demonstration appeared to be the evidence against them.

The doctor departed from their lodgings enraged at this supposed
discovery, and, unhappily for Booth, was engaged to supper that very
evening with the country gentleman of whom Booth had rented a farm.
As the poor captain happened to be the subject of conversation, and
occasioned their comparing notes, the account which the doctor gave of
what he had seen that evening so incensed the gentleman, to whom Booth
was likewise a debtor, that he vowed he would take a writ out against
him the next morning, and have his body alive or dead; and the
doctor was at last persuaded to do the same. Mr. Murphy was thereupon
immediately sent for; and the doctor in his presence repeated again what
he had seen at his lodgings as the foundation of his suing him, which
the attorney, as we have before seen, had blabbed to Atkinson.

But no sooner did the doctor hear that Booth was arrested than the
wretched condition of his wife and family began to affect his mind. The
children, who were to be utterly undone with their father, were intirely
innocent; and as for Amelia herself, though he thought he had most
convincing proofs of very blameable levity, yet his former friendship
and affection to her were busy to invent every excuse, till, by very
heavily loading the husband, they lightened the suspicion against the
wife.

In this temper of mind he resolved to pay Amelia a second visit, and was
on his way to Mrs. Ellison when the serjeant met him and made himself
known to him. The doctor took his old servant into a coffee-house, where
he received from him such an account of Booth and his family, that he
desired the serjeant to shew him presently to Amelia; and this was
the cordial which we mentioned at the end of the ninth chapter of the
preceding book.

The doctor became soon satisfied concerning the trinkets which had given
him so much uneasiness, and which had brought so much mischief on the
head of poor Booth. Amelia likewise gave the doctor some satisfaction
as to what he had heard of her husband's behaviour in the country; and
assured him, upon her honour, that Booth could so well answer every
complaint against his conduct, that she had no doubt but that a man of
the doctor's justice and candour would entirely acquit him, and would
consider him as an innocent unfortunate man, who was the object of a
good man's compassion, not of his anger or resentment.

This worthy clergyman, who was not desirous of finding proofs to condemn
the captain or to justify his own vindictive proceedings, but, on the
contrary, rejoiced heartily in every piece of evidence which tended
to clear up the character of his friend, gave a ready ear to all which
Amelia said. To this, indeed, he was induced by the love he always had
for that lady, by the good opinion he entertained of her, as well as
by pity for her present condition, than which nothing appeared more
miserable; for he found her in the highest agonies of grief and despair,
with her two little children crying over their wretched mother. These
are, indeed, to a well-disposed mind, the most tragical sights that
human nature can furnish, and afford a juster motive to grief and tears
in the beholder than it would be to see all the heroes who have ever
infested the earth hanged all together in a string.

The doctor felt this sight as he ought. He immediately endeavoured to
comfort the afflicted; in which he so well succeeded, that he restored
to Amelia sufficient spirits to give him the satisfaction we have
mentioned: after which he declared he would go and release her husband,
which he accordingly did in the manner we have above related.




Chapter ii

_In which the history goes forward._


We now return to that period of our history to which we had brought it
at the end of our last book.

Booth and his friends arrived from the bailiff's, at the serjeant's
lodgings, where Booth immediately ran up-stairs to his Amelia; between
whom I shall not attempt to describe the meeting. Nothing certainly was
ever more tender or more joyful. This, however, I will observe, that a
very few of these exquisite moments, of which the best minds only are
capable, do in reality over-balance the longest enjoyments which can
ever fall to the lot of the worst.

Whilst Booth and his wife were feasting their souls with the most
delicious mutual endearments, the doctor was fallen to play with the two
little children below-stairs. While he was thus engaged the little boy
did somewhat amiss; upon which the doctor said, "If you do so any more I
will take your papa away from you again."--"Again! sir," said the child;
"why, was it you then that took away my papa before?" "Suppose it was,"
said the doctor; "would not you forgive me?" "Yes," cries the child,
"I would forgive you; because a Christian must forgive everybody; but I
should hate you as long as I live."

The doctor was so pleased with the boy's answer, that he caught him in
his arms and kissed him; at which time Booth and his wife returned. The
doctor asked which of them was their son's instructor in his religion;
Booth answered that he must confess Amelia had all the merit of that
kind. "I should have rather thought he had learnt of his father," cries
the doctor; "for he seems a good soldier-like Christian, and professes
to hate his enemies with a very good grace."

"How, Billy!" cries Amelia. "I am sure I did not teach you so."

"I did not say I would hate my enemies, madam," cries the boy; "I only
said I would hate papa's enemies. Sure, mamma, there is no harm in that;
nay, I am sure there is no harm in it, for I have heard you say the same
thing a thousand times."

The doctor smiled on the child, and, chucking him under the chin, told
him he must hate nobody 5 and now Mrs. Atkinson, who had provided a
dinner for them all, desired them to walk up and partake of it.

And now it was that Booth was first made acquainted with the serjeant's
marriage, as was Dr Harrison; both of whom greatly felicitated him upon
it.

Mrs. Atkinson, who was, perhaps, a little more confounded than she would
have been had she married a colonel, said, "If I have done wrong, Mrs.
Booth is to answer for it, for she made the match; indeed, Mr. Atkinson,
you are greatly obliged to the character which this lady gives of you."
"I hope he will deserve it," said the doctor; "and, if the army hath not
corrupted a good boy, I believe I may answer for him."

While our little company were enjoying that happiness which never fails
to attend conversation where all present are pleased with each other, a
visitant arrived who was, perhaps, not very welcome to any of them.
This was no other than Colonel James, who, entering the room with much
gaiety, went directly up to Booth, embraced him, and expressed great
satisfaction at finding him there; he then made an apology for not
attending him in the morning, which he said had been impossible; and
that he had, with the utmost difficulty, put off some business of great
consequence in order to serve him this afternoon; "but I am glad on your
account," cried he to Booth, "that my presence was not necessary."

Booth himself was extremely satisfied with this declaration, and failed
not to return him as many thanks as he would have deserved had he
performed his promise; but the two ladies were not quite so well
satisfied. As for the serjeant, he had slipt out of the room when the
colonel entered, not entirely out of that bashfulness which we have
remarked him to be tainted with, but indeed, from what had past in the
morning, he hated the sight of the colonel as well on the account of his
wife as on that of his friend.

The doctor, on the contrary, on what he had formerly heard from both
Amelia and her husband of the colonel's generosity and friendship, had
built so good an opinion of him, that he was very much pleased with
seeing him, and took the first opportunity of telling him so. "Colonel,"
said the doctor, "I have not the happiness of being known to you; but
I have long been desirous of an acquaintance with a gentleman in whose
commendation I have heard so much from some present." The colonel made a
proper answer to this compliment, and they soon entered into a familiar
conversation together; for the doctor was not difficult of access;
indeed, he held the strange reserve which is usually practised in this
nation between people who are in any degree strangers to each other to
be very unbecoming the Christian character.

The two ladies soon left the room; and the remainder of the visit, which
was not very long, past in discourse on various common subjects, not
worth recording. In the conclusion, the colonel invited Booth and his
lady, and the doctor, to dine with him the next day.

To give Colonel James his due commendation, he had shewn a great command
of himself and great presence of mind on this occasion; for, to speak
the plain truth, the visit was intended to Amelia alone; nor did he
expect, or perhaps desire, anything less than to find the captain at
home. The great joy which he suddenly conveyed into his countenance at
the unexpected sight of his friend is to be attributed to that noble art
which is taught in those excellent schools called the several courts of
Europe. By this, men are enabled to dress out their countenances as much
at their own pleasure as they do their bodies, and to put on friendship
with as much ease as they can a laced coat.

When the colonel and doctor were gone, Booth acquainted Amelia with
the invitation he had received. She was so struck with the news, and
betrayed such visible marks of confusion and uneasiness, that they could
not have escaped Booth's observation had suspicion given him the least
hint to remark; but this, indeed, is the great optic-glass helping us to
discern plainly almost all that passes in the minds of others, without
some use of which nothing is more purblind than human nature.

Amelia, having recovered from her first perturbation, answered, "My
dear, I will dine with you wherever you please to lay your commands on
me." "I am obliged to you, my dear soul," cries Booth; "your obedience
shall be very easy, for my command will be that you shall always follow
your own inclinations." "My inclinations," answered she, "would, I am
afraid, be too unreasonable a confinement to you; for they would always
lead me to be with you and your children, with at most a single friend
or two now and then." "O my dear!" replied he, "large companies give us
a greater relish for our own society when we return to it; and we shall
be extremely merry, for Doctor Harrison dines with us." "I hope you
will, my dear," cries she; "but I own I should have been better pleased
to have enjoyed a few days with yourself and the children, with no other
person but Mrs. Atkinson, for whom I have conceived a violent affection,
and who would have given us but little interruption. However, if you
have promised, I must undergo the penance." "Nay, child," cried he, "I
am sure I would have refused, could I have guessed it had been in the
least disagreeable to you though I know your objection." "Objection!"
cries Amelia eagerly "I have no objection." "Nay, nay," said he, "come,
be honest, I know your objection, though you are unwilling to own
it." "Good Heavens!" cryed Amelia, frightened, "what do you mean? what
objection?" "Why," answered he, "to the company of Mrs. James; and
I must confess she hath not behaved to you lately as you might have
expected; but you ought to pass all that by for the sake of her
husband, to whom we have both so many obligations, who is the worthiest,
honestest, and most generous fellow in the universe, and the best friend
to me that ever man had."

Amelia, who had far other suspicions, and began to fear that her husband
had discovered them, was highly pleased when she saw him taking a wrong
scent. She gave, therefore, a little in to the deceit, and acknowledged
the truth of what he had mentioned; but said that the pleasure she
should have in complying with his desires would highly recompense any
dissatisfaction which might arise on any other account; and shortly
after ended the conversation on this subject with her chearfully
promising to fulfil his promise.

In reality, poor Amelia had now a most unpleasant task to undertake;
for she thought it absolutely necessary to conceal from her husband
the opinion she had conceived of the colonel. For, as she knew the
characters, as well of her husband as of his friend, or rather enemy
(both being often synonymous in the language of the world), she had
the utmost reason to apprehend something very fatal might attend her
husband's entertaining the same thought of James which filled and
tormented her own breast.

And, as she knew that nothing but these thoughts could justify the least
unkind, or, indeed, the least reserved behaviour to James, who had,
in all appearance, conferred the greatest obligations upon Booth and
herself, she was reduced to a dilemma the most dreadful that can attend
a virtuous woman, as it often gives the highest triumph, and sometimes
no little advantage, to the men of professed gallantry.

In short, to avoid giving any umbrage to her husband, Amelia was forced
to act in a manner which she was conscious must give encouragement to
the colonel; a situation which perhaps requires as great prudence and
delicacy as any in which the heroic part of the female character can be
exerted.




Chapter iii.

_A conversation between Dr Harrison and others_.


The next day Booth and his lady, with the doctor, met at Colonel
James's, where Colonel Bath likewise made one of the company.

Nothing very remarkable passed at dinner, or till the ladies withdrew.
During this time, however, the behaviour of Colonel James was such as
gave some uneasiness to Amelia, who well understood his meaning, though
the particulars were too refined and subtle to be observed by any other
present.

When the ladies were gone, which was as soon as Amelia could prevail
on Mrs. James to depart, Colonel Bath, who had been pretty brisk with
champagne at dinner, soon began to display his magnanimity. "My brother
tells me, young gentleman," said he to Booth, "that you have been used
very ill lately by some rascals, and I have no doubt but you will do
yourself justice."

Booth answered that he did not know what he meant. "Since I must mention
it then," cries the colonel, "I hear you have been arrested; and I think
you know what satisfaction is to be required by a man of honour."

"I beg, sir," says the doctor, "no more may be mentioned of that matter.
I am convinced no satisfaction will be required of the captain till he
is able to give it."

"I do not understand what you mean by able," cries the colonel. To which
the doctor answered, "That it was of too tender a nature to speak more
of."

"Give me your hand, doctor," cries the colonel; "I see you are a man of
honour, though you wear a gown. It is, as you say, a matter of a tender
nature. Nothing, indeed, is so tender as a man's honour. Curse my liver,
if any man--I mean, that is, if any gentleman, was to arrest me, I would
as surely cut his throat as--"

"How, sir!" said the doctor, "would you compensate one breach of the law
by a much greater, and pay your debts by committing murder?"

"Why do you mention law between gentlemen?" says the colonel. "A man of
honour wears his law by his side; and can the resentment of an affront
make a gentleman guilty of murder? and what greater affront can one
man cast upon another than by arresting him? I am convinced that he who
would put up an arrest would put up a slap in the face."

Here the colonel looked extremely fierce, and the divine stared
with astonishment at this doctrine; when Booth, who well knew the
impossibility of opposing the colonel's humour with success, began to
play with it; and, having first conveyed a private wink to the doctor,
he said there might be cases undoubtedly where such an affront ought
to be resented; but that there were others where any resentment was
impracticable: "As, for instance," said he, "where the man is arrested
by a woman."

"I could not be supposed to mean that case," cries the colonel; "and you
are convinced I did not mean it."

"To put an end to this discourse at once, sir," said the doctor, "I was
the plaintiff at whose suit this gentleman was arrested."

"Was you so, sir?" cries the colonel; "then I have no more to say. Women
and the clergy are upon the same footing. The long-robed gentry are
exempted from the laws of honour."

"I do not thank you for that exemption, sir," cries the doctor; "and, if
honour and fighting are, as they seem to be, synonymous words with you,
I believe there are some clergymen, who in defence of their religion, or
their country, or their friend, the only justifiable causes of fighting,
except bare self-defence, would fight as bravely as yourself, colonel!
and that without being paid for it."

"Sir, you are privileged," says the colonel, with great dignity; "and
you have my leave to say what you please. I respect your order, and you
cannot offend me."

"I will not offend you, colonel," cries the doctor; "and our order is
very much obliged to you, since you profess so much respect to us, and
pay none to our Master."

"What Master, sir?" said the colonel.

"That Master," answered the doctor, "who hath expressly forbidden all
that cutting of throats to which you discover so much inclination."

"O! your servant, sir," said the colonel; "I see what you are driving
at; but you shall not persuade me to think that religion forces me to be
a coward."

"I detest and despise the name as much as you can," cries the doctor;
"but you have a wrong idea of the word, colonel. What were all the
Greeks and Romans? were these cowards? and yet, did you ever hear of
this butchery, which we call duelling, among them?"

"Yes, indeed, have I," cries the colonel. "What else is all Mr. Pope's
Homer full of but duels? Did not what's his name, one of the Agamemnons,
fight with that paultry rascal Paris? and Diomede with what d'ye call
him there? and Hector with I forget his name, he that was Achilles's
bosom-friend; and afterwards with Achilles himself? Nay, and in Dryden's
Virgil, is there anything almost besides fighting?"

"You are a man of learning, colonel," cries the doctor; "but--"

"I thank you for that compliment," said the colonel.--"No, sir, I do
not pretend to learning; but I have some little reading, and I am not
ashamed to own it."

"But are you sure, colonel," cries the doctor, "that you have not made
a small mistake? for I am apt to believe both Mr. Pope and Mr. Dryden
(though I cannot say I ever read a word of either of them) speak of wars
between nations, and not of private duels; for of the latter I do not
remember one single instance in all the Greek and Roman story. In short,
it is a modern custom, introduced by barbarous nations since the times
of Christianity; though it is a direct and audacious defiance of the
Christian law, and is consequently much more sinful in us than it would
have been in the heathens."

"Drink about, doctor," cries the colonel; "and let us call a new cause;
for I perceive we shall never agree on this. You are a Churchman, and I
don't expect you to speak your mind."

"We are both of the same Church, I hope," cries the doctor.

"I am of the Church of England, sir," answered the colonel, "and will
fight for it to the last drop of my blood."

"It is very generous in you, colonel," cries the doctor, "to fight so
zealously for a religion by which you are to be damned."

"It is well for you, doctor," cries the colonel, "that you wear a gown;
for, by all the dignity of a man, if any other person had said the words
you have just uttered, I would have made him eat them; ay, d--n me, and
my sword into the bargain."

Booth began to be apprehensive that this dispute might grow too warm;
in which case he feared that the colonel's honour, together with the
champagne, might hurry him so far as to forget the respect due, and
which he professed to pay, to the sacerdotal robe. Booth therefore
interposed between the disputants, and said that the colonel had very
rightly proposed to call a new subject; for that it was impossible to
reconcile accepting a challenge with the Christian religion, or refusing
it with the modern notion of honour. "And you must allow it, doctor,"
said he, "to be a very hard injunction for a man to become infamous;
and more especially for a soldier, who is to lose his bread into the
bargain."

"Ay, sir," says the colonel, with an air of triumph, "what say you to
that?"

"Why, I say," cries the doctor, "that it is much harder to be damned on
the other side."

"That may be," said the colonel; "but damn me, if I would take an
affront of any man breathing, for all that. And yet I believe myself to
be as good a Christian as wears a head. My maxim is, never to give an
affront, nor ever to take one; and I say that it is the maxim of a good
Christian, and no man shall ever persuade me to the contrary."

"Well, sir," said the doctor, "since that is your resolution, I hope no
man will ever give you an affront."

"I am obliged to you for your hope, doctor," cries the colonel, with
a sneer; "and he that doth will be obliged to you for lending him
your gown; for, by the dignity of a man, nothing out of petticoats, I
believe, dares affront me."

Colonel James had not hitherto joined in the discourse. In truth, his
thoughts had been otherwise employed; nor is it very difficult for the
reader to guess what had been the subject of them. Being waked, however,
from his reverie, and having heard the two or three last speeches, he
turned to his brother, and asked him, why he would introduce such a
topic of conversation before a gentleman of Doctor Harrison's character?

"Brother," cried Bath, "I own it was wrong, and I ask the doctor's
pardon: I know not how it happened to arise; for you know, brother, I am
not used to talk of these matters. They are generally poltroons that do.
I think I need not be beholden to my tongue to declare I am none. I have
shown myself in a line of battle. I believe there is no man will deny
that; I believe I may say no man dares deny that I have done my duty."

The colonel was thus proceeding to prove that his prowess was neither
the subject of his discourse nor the object of his vanity, when a
servant entered and summoned the company to tea with the ladies; a
summons which Colonel James instantly obeyed, and was followed by all
the rest.

But as the tea-table conversation, though extremely delightful to those
who are engaged in it, may probably appear somewhat dull to the reader,
we will here put an end to the chapter.




Chapter iv.

_A dialogue between Booth and Amelia_.


The next morning early, Booth went by appointment and waited on Colonel
James; whence he returned to Amelia in that kind of disposition which
the great master of human passion would describe in Andromache, when he
tells us she cried and smiled at the same instant.

Amelia plainly perceived the discomposure of his mind, in which
the opposite affections of joy and grief were struggling for the
superiority, and begged to know the occasion; upon which Booth spoke as
follows:--

"My dear," said he, "I had no intention to conceal from you what hath
past this morning between me and the colonel, who hath oppressed me, if
I may use that expression, with obligations. Sure never man had such a
friend; for never was there so noble, so generous a heart--I cannot help
this ebullition of gratitude, I really cannot." Here he paused a moment,
and wiped his eyes, and then proceeded: "You know, my dear, how gloomy
the prospect was yesterday before our eyes, how inevitable ruin stared
me in the face; and the dreadful idea of having entailed beggary on my
Amelia and her posterity racked my mind; for though, by the goodness of
the doctor, I had regained my liberty, the debt yet remained; and, if
that worthy man had a design of forgiving me his share, this must have
been my utmost hope, and the condition in which I must still have found
myself need not to be expatiated on. In what light, then, shall I see,
in what words shall I relate, the colonel's kindness? O my dear Amelia!
he hath removed the whole gloom at once, hath driven all despair out
of my mind, and hath filled it with the most sanguine, and, at the same
time, the most reasonable hopes of making a comfortable provision for
yourself and my dear children. In the first place, then, he will advance
me a sum of money to pay off all my debts; and this on a bond to be
repaid only when I shall become colonel of a regiment, and not before.
In the next place, he is gone this very morning to ask a company for me,
which is now vacant in the West Indies; and, as he intends to push this
with all his interest, neither he nor I have any doubt of his success.
Now, my dear, comes the third, which, though perhaps it ought to give me
the greatest joy, such is, I own, the weakness of my nature, it rends my
very heartstrings asunder. I cannot mention it, for I know it will give
you equal pain; though I know, on all proper occasions, you can exert a
manly resolution. You will not, I am convinced, oppose it, whatever you
must suffer in complying. O my dear Amelia! I must suffer likewise;
yet I have resolved to bear it. You know not what my poor heart hath
suffered since he made the proposal. It is love for you alone which
could persuade me to submit to it. Consider our situation; consider that
of our children; reflect but on those poor babes, whose future happiness
is at stake, and it must arm your resolution. It is your interest and
theirs that reconciled me to a proposal which, when the colonel first
made it, struck me with the utmost horror; he hath, indeed, from these
motives, persuaded me into a resolution which I thought impossible for
any one to have persuaded me into. O my dear Amelia! let me entreat
you to give me up to the good of your children, as I have promised the
colonel to give you up to their interest and your own. If you refuse
these terms we are still undone, for he insists absolutely upon them.
Think, then, my love, however hard they may be, necessity compels us to
submit to them. I know in what light a woman, who loves like you, must
consider such a proposal; and yet how many instances have you of women
who, from the same motives, have submitted to the same!"

"What can you mean, Mr. Booth?" cries Amelia, trembling.

"Need I explain my meaning to you more?" answered Booth.--"Did I not say
I must give up my Ameli, after making
many compliments to the doctor upon it, he turned to his son, and told
him he had an opportunity now of learning more in one day than he had
learnt at the university in a twelvemonth.

The son replied, that he allowed the doctrine to be extremely good in
general, and that he agreed with the greater part; "but I must make a
distinction," said he. However, he was interrupted from his distinction
at present, for now Booth returned with Amelia and the children.




Chapter ix.

_A scene of modern wit and humour._


In the afternoon the old gentleman proposed a walk to Vauxhall, a place
of which, he said, he had heard much, but had never seen it.

The doctor readily agreed to his friend's proposal, and soon after
ordered two coaches to be sent for to carry the whole company. But when
the servant was gone for them Booth acquainted the doctor that it was
yet too early. "Is it so?" said the doctor; "why, then, I will carry you
first to one of the greatest and highest entertainments in the world."

The children pricked up their ears at this, nor did any of the company
guess what he meant; and Amelia asked what entertainment he could carry
them to at that time of day?

"Suppose," says the doctor, "I should carry you to court."

"At five o'clock in the afternoon!" cries Booth.

"Ay, suppose I should have interest enough to introduce you into the
presence."

"You are jesting, dear sir," cries Amelia.

"Indeed, I am serious," answered the doctor. "I will introduce you into
that presence, compared to whom the greatest emperor on the earth is
many millions of degrees meaner than the most contemptible reptile is to
him. What entertainment can there be to a rational being equal to this?
Was not the taste of mankind most wretchedly depraved, where would the
vain man find an honour, or where would the love of pleasure propose
so adequate an object as divine worship? with what ecstasy must the
contemplation of being admitted to such a presence fill the mind!
The pitiful courts of princes are open to few, and to those only at
particular seasons; but from this glorious and gracious presence we are
none of us, and at no time excluded."

The doctor was proceeding thus when the servant returned, saying the
coaches were ready; and the whole company with the greatest alacrity
attended the doctor to St James's church.

When the service was ended, and they were again got into their coaches,
Amelia returned the doctor many thanks for the light in which he had
placed divine worship, assuring him that she had never before had so
much transport in her devotion as at this time, and saying she believed
she should be the better for this notion he had given her as long as she
lived.

The coaches being come to the water-side, they all alighted, and,
getting into one boat, proceeded to Vauxhall.

The extreme beauty and elegance of this place is well known to almost
every one of my readers; and happy is it for me that it is so, since
to give an adequate idea of it would exceed my power of description.
To delineate the particular beauties of these gardens would, indeed,
require as much pains, and as much paper too, as to rehearse all
the good actions of their master, whose life proves the truth of an
observation which I have read in some ethic writer, that a truly elegant
taste is generally accompanied with an excellency of heart; or, in other
words, that true virtue is, indeed, nothing else but true taste.

Here our company diverted themselves with walking an hour or two before
the music began. Of all the seven, Booth alone had ever been here
before; so that, to all the rest, the place, with its other charms, had
that of novelty. When the music played, Amelia, who stood next to
the doctor, said to him in a whisper, "I hope I am not guilty of
profaneness; but, in pursuance of that chearful chain of thoughts with
which you have inspired me this afternoon, I was just now lost in a
reverie, and fancied myself in those blissful mansions which we hope to
enjoy hereafter. The delicious sweetness of the place, the enchanting
charms of the music, and the satisfaction which appears in every one's
countenance, carried my soul almost to heaven in its ideas. I could not
have, indeed, imagined there had been anything like this in this world."

The doctor smiled, and said, "You see, dear madam, there may be
pleasures of which you could conceive no idea till you actually enjoyed
them."

And now the little boy, who had long withstood the attractions of
several cheesecakes that passed to and fro, could contain no longer, but
asked his mother to give him one, saying, "I am sure my sister would be
glad of another, though she is ashamed to ask." The doctor, overhearing
the child, proposed that they should all retire to some place where
they might sit down and refresh themselves; which they accordingly did.
Amelia now missed her husband; but, as she had three men in her company,
and one of them was the doctor, she concluded herself and her children
to be safe, and doubted not but that Booth would soon find her out.

They now sat down, and the doctor very gallantly desired Amelia to call
for what she liked. Upon which the children were supplied with cakes,
and some ham and chicken were provided for the rest of the company; with
which while they were regaling themselves with the highest satisfaction,
two young fellows walking arm-in-arm, came up, and when they came
opposite to Amelia they stood still, staring Amelia full in the face,
and one of them cried aloud to the other, "D--n me, my lord, if she is
not an angel!"--My lord stood still, staring likewise at her, without
speaking a word; when two others of the same gang came up, and one of
them cried, "Come along, Jack, I have seen her before; but she is too
well manned already. Three----are enough for one woman, or the devil is
in it!"

"D--n me," says he that spoke first, and whom they called Jack, "I will
have a brush at her if she belonged to the whole convocation." And so
saying, he went up to the young clergyman, and cried, "Doctor, sit up a
little, if you please, and don't take up more room in a bed than belongs
to you." At which words he gave the young man a push, and seated himself
down directly over against Amelia, and, leaning both his elbows on
the table, he fixed his eyes on her in a manner with which modesty can
neither look nor bear to be looked at.

Amelia seemed greatly shocked at this treatment; upon which the doctor
removed her within him, and then, facing the gentleman, asked him what
he meant by this rude behaviour?--Upon which my lord stept up and said,
"Don't be impertinent, old gentleman. Do you think such fellows as you
are to keep, d--n me, such fine wenches, d--n me, to yourselves, d--n
me?"

"No, no," cries Jack, "the old gentleman is more reasonable. Here's the
fellow that eats up the tithe-pig. Don't you see how his mouth waters at
her? Where's your slabbering bib?" For, though the gentleman had rightly
guessed he was a clergyman, yet he had not any of those insignia on with
which it would have been improper to have appeared there.

"Such boys as you," cries the young clergyman, "ought to be well whipped
at school, instead of being suffered to become nuisances in society."

"Boys, sir!" says Jack; "I believe I am as good a man as yourself,
Mr.----, and as good a scholar too. _Bos fur sus quotque sacerdos_. Tell
me what's next. D--n me, I'll hold you fifty pounds you don't tell me
what's next."

"You have him, Jack," cries my lord. "It is over with him, d--n me! he
can't strike another blow."

"If I had you in a proper place," cries the clergyman, "you should find
I would strike a blow, and a pretty hard one too."

"There," cries my lord, "there is the meekness of the clergyman--there
spoke the wolf in sheep's clothing. D--n me, how big he looks! You must
be civil to him, faith! or else he will burst with pride."

"Ay, ay," cries Jack, "let the clergy alone for pride; there's not a
lord in the kingdom now hath half the pride of that fellow."

"Pray, sir," cries the doctor, turning to the other, "are you a lord?"

"Yes, Mr. ----," cries he, "I have that honour, indeed."

"And I suppose you have pride too," said the doctor.

"I hope I have, sir," answered he, "at your service."

"If such a one as you, sir," cries the doctor, "who are not only a
scandal to the title you bear as a lord, but even as a man, can pretend
to pride, why will you not allow it to a clergyman? I suppose, sir, by
your dress, you are in the army? and, by the ribbon in your hat, you
seem to be proud of that too. How much greater and more honourable is
the service in which that gentleman is enlisted than yours! Why then
should you object to the pride of the clergy, since the lowest of the
function is in reality every way so much your superior?"

"Tida Tidu Tidum," cries my lord.

"However, gentlemen," cries the doctor, "if you have the least
pretension to that name, I beg you will put an end to your frolic; since
you see it gives so much uneasiness to the lady. Nay, I entreat you for
your own sakes, for here is one coming who will talk to you in a very
different stile from ours."

"One coming!" cries my lord; "what care I who is coming?"

"I suppose it is the devil," cries Jack; "for here are two of his livery
servants already."

"Let the devil come as soon as he will," cries my lord; "d--n me if I
have not a kiss!"

Amelia now fell a trembling; and her children, perceiving her fright,
both hung on her, and began to cry; when Booth and Captain Trent both
came up.

Booth, seeing his wife disordered, asked eagerly what was the matter?
At the same time the lord and his companion, seeing Captain Trent, whom
they well knew, said both together, "What, doth this company belong
to you?" When the doctor, with great presence of mind, as he was
apprehensive of some fatal consequence if Booth should know what had
past, said, "So, Mr. Booth, I am glad you are returned; your poor lady
here began to be frighted out of her wits. But now you have him again,"
said he to Amelia, "I hope you will be easy."

Amelia, frighted as she was, presently took the hint, and greatly
chid her husband for leaving her. But the little boy was not so
quick-sighted, and cried, "Indeed, papa, those naughty men there have
frighted my mamma out of her wits."

"How!" cries Booth, a little moved; "frightened! Hath any one frightened
you, my dear?"

"No, my love," answered she, "nothing. I know not what the child means.
Everything is well now I see you safe."

Trent had been all the while talking aside with the young sparks; and
now, addressing himself to Booth, said, "Here hath been some little
mistake; I believe my lord mistook Mrs. Booth for some other lady."

"It is impossible," cries my lord, "to know every one. I am sure, if
I had known the lady to be a woman of fashion, and an acquaintance of
Captain Trent, I should have said nothing disagreeable to her; but, if I
have, I ask her pardon, and the company's."

"I am in the dark," cries Booth. "Pray what is all this matter?"

"Nothing of any consequence," cries the doctor, "nor worth your
enquiring into. You hear it was a mistake of the person, and I really
believe his lordship that all proceeded from his not knowing to whom the
lady belonged."

"Come, come," says Trent, "there is nothing in the matter, I assure you.
I will tell you the whole another time."

"Very well; since you say so," cries Booth, "I am contented." So ended
the affair, and the two sparks made their congee, and sneaked off.

"Now they are gone," said the young gentleman, "I must say I never saw
two worse-bred jackanapes, nor fellows that deserved to be kicked more.
If I had had them in another place I would have taught them a little
more respect to the church."

"You took rather a better way," answered the doctor, "to teach them that
respect."

Booth now desired his friend Trent to sit down with them, and proposed
to call for a fresh bottle of wine; but Amelia's spirits were too much
disconcerted to give her any prospect of pleasure that evening. She
therefore laid hold of the pretence of her children, for whom she said
the hour was already too late; with which the doctor agreed. So they
paid their reckoning and departed, leaving to the two rakes the triumph
of having totally dissipated the mirth of this little innocent company,
who were before enjoying complete satisfaction.




Chapter x.

_A curious conversation between the doctor, the young clergyman, and the
young clergyman's father_.


The next morning, when the doctor and his two friends were at breakfast,
the young clergyman, in whose mind the injurious treatment he had
received the evening before was very deeply impressed, renewed the
conversation on that subject.

"It is a scandal," said he, "to the government, that they do not
preserve more respect to the clergy, by punishing all rudeness to them
with the utmost severity. It was very justly observed of you, sir,"
said he to the doctor, "that the lowest clergyman in England is in real
dignity superior to the highest nobleman. What then can be so shocking
as to see that gown, which ought to entitle us to the veneration of
all we meet, treated with contempt and ridicule? Are we not, in fact,
ambassadors from heaven to the world? and do they not, therefore, in
denying us our due respect, deny it in reality to Him that sent us?"

"If that be the case," says the doctor, "it behoves them to look to
themselves; for He who sent us is able to exact most severe vengeance
for the ill treatment of His ministers."

"Very true, sir," cries the young one; "and I heartily hope He will;
but those punishments are at too great a distance to infuse terror
into wicked minds. The government ought to interfere with its immediate
censures. Fines and imprisonments and corporal punishments operate more
forcibly on the human mind than all the fears of damnation."

"Do you think so?" cries the doctor; "then I am afraid men are very
little in earnest in those fears."

"Most justly observed," says the old gentleman. "Indeed, I am afraid
that is too much the case."

"In that," said the son, "the government is to blame. Are not books
of infidelity, treating our holy religion as a mere imposture, nay,
sometimes as a mere jest, published daily, and spread abroad amongst the
people with perfect impunity?"

"You are certainly in the right," says the doctor; "there is a most
blameable remissness with regard to these matters; but the whole blame
doth not lie there; some little share of the fault is, I am afraid, to
be imputed to the clergy themselves."

"Indeed, sir," cries the young one, "I did not expect that charge from
a gentleman of your cloth. Do the clergy give any encouragement to
such books? Do they not, on the contrary, cry loudly out against the
suffering them? This is the invidious aspersion of the laity; and I did
not expect to hear it confirmed by one of our own cloth."

"Be not too impatient, young gentleman," said the doctor. "I do not
absolutely confirm the charge of the laity; it is much too general and
too severe; but even the laity themselves do not attack them in that
part to which you have applied your defence. They are not supposed
such fools as to attack that religion to which they owe their temporal
welfare. They are not taxed with giving any other support to infidelity
than what it draws from the ill examples of their lives; I mean of the
lives of some of them. Here too the laity carry their censures too far;
for there are very few or none of the clergy whose lives, if compared
with those of the laity, can be called profligate; but such, indeed,
is the perfect purity of our religion, such is the innocence and virtue
which it exacts to entitle us to its glorious rewards and to screen us
from its dreadful punishments, that he must be a very good man indeed
who lives up to it. Thus then these persons argue. This man is educated
in a perfect knowledge of religion, is learned in its laws, and is by
his profession obliged, in a manner, to have them always before his
eyes. The rewards which it promises to the obedience of these laws are
so great, and the punishments threatened on disobedience so dreadful,
that it is impossible but all men must fearfully fly from the one,
and as eagerly pursue the other. If, therefore, such a person lives
in direct opposition to, and in a constant breach of, these laws, the
inference is obvious. There is a pleasant story in Matthew Paris, which
I will tell you as well as I can remember it. Two young gentlemen,
I think they were priests, agreed together that whosoever died first
should return and acquaint his friend with the secrets of the other
world. One of them died soon after, and fulfilled his promise. The
whole relation he gave is not very material; but, among other things, he
produced one of his hands, which Satan had made use of to write upon,
as the moderns do on a card, and had sent his compliments to the priests
for the number of souls which the wicked examples of their lives daily
sent to hell. This story is the more remarkable as it was written by a
priest, and a great favourer of his order."

"Excellent!" cried the old gentleman; "what a memory you have."

"But, sir," cries the young one, "a clergyman is a man as well as
another; and, if such perfect purity be expected--"

"I do not expect it," cries the doctor; "and I hope it will not be
expected of us. The Scripture itself gives us this hope, where the best
of us are said to fall twenty times a-day. But sure we may not allow
the practice of any of those grosser crimes which contaminate the
whole mind. We may expect an obedience to the ten commandments, and an
abstinence from such notorious vices as, in the first place,
Avarice, which, indeed, can hardly subsist without the breach of more
commandments than one. Indeed, it would be excessive candour to imagine
that a man who so visibly sets his whole heart, not only on this world,
but on one of the most worthless things in it (for so is money, without
regard to its uses), should be, at the same time, laying up his treasure
in heaven. Ambition is a second vice of this sort: we are told we cannot
serve God and Mammon. I might have applied this to avarice; but I chose
rather to mention it here. When we see a man sneaking about in courts
and levees, and doing the dirty work of great men, from the hopes of
preferment, can we believe that a fellow whom we see to have so many
hard task-masters upon earth ever thinks of his Master which is in
heaven? Must he not himself think, if ever he reflects at all, that so
glorious a Master will disdain and disown a servant who is the dutiful
tool of a court-favourite, and employed either as the pimp of his
pleasure, or sometimes, perhaps, made a dirty channel to assist in the
conveyance of that corruption which is clogging up and destroying the
very vitals of his country?

"The last vice which I shall mention is Pride. There is not in the
universe a more ridiculous nor a more contemptible animal than a proud
clergyman; a turkey-cock or a jackdaw are objects of veneration when
compared with him. I don't mean, by Pride, that noble dignity of mind to
which goodness can only administer an adequate object, which delights in
the testimony of its own conscience, and could not, without the highest
agonies, bear its condemnation. By Pride I mean that saucy passion which
exults in every little eventual pre-eminence over other men: such are
the ordinary gifts of nature, and the paultry presents of fortune,
wit, knowledge, birth, strength, beauty, riches, titles, and rank. That
passion which is ever aspiring, like a silly child, to look over the
heads of all about them; which, while it servilely adheres to the great,
flies from the poor, as if afraid of contamination; devouring greedily
every murmur of applause and every look of admiration; pleased and
elated with all kind of respect; and hurt and enflamed with the contempt
of the lowest and most despicable of fools, even with such as treated
you last night disrespectfully at Vauxhall. Can such a mind as this be
fixed on things above? Can such a man reflect that he hath the ineffable
honour to be employed in the immediate service of his great Creator?
or can he please himself with the heart-warming hope that his ways are
acceptable in the sight of that glorious, that incomprehensible Being?"

"Hear, child, hear," cries the old gentleman; "hear, and improve your
understanding. Indeed, my good friend, no one retires from you without
carrying away some good instructions with him. Learn of the doctor, Tom,
and you will be the better man as long as you live."

"Undoubtedly, sir," answered Tom, "the doctor hath spoken a great deal
of excellent truth; and, without a compliment to him, I was always a
great admirer of his sermons, particularly of their oratory. But,

    _Nee tamen hoc tribuens dederim quoque caetera_.

I cannot agree that a clergyman is obliged to put up with an affront
any more than another man, and more especially when it is paid to the
order."

"I am very sorry, young gentleman," cries the doctor, "that you should
be ever liable to be affronted as a clergyman; and I do assure you, if
I had known your disposition formerly, the order should never have been
affronted through you."

The old gentleman now began to check his son for his opposition to the
doctor, when a servant delivered the latter a note from Amelia, which he
read immediately to himself, and it contained the following words:

"MY DEAR SIR,--Something hath happened since I saw you which gives me
great uneasiness, and I beg the favour of seeing you as soon as possible
to advise with you upon it. I am

"Your most obliged and dutiful daughter,

"AMELIA BOOTH."

The doctor's answer was, that he would wait on the lady directly; and
then, turning to his friend, he asked him if he would not take a walk in
the Park before dinner. "I must go," says he, "to the lady who was with
us last night; for I am afraid, by her letter, some bad accident hath
happened to her. Come, young gentleman, I spoke a little too hastily to
you just now; but I ask your pardon. Some allowance must be made to the
warmth of your blood. I hope we shall, in time, both think alike."

The old gentleman made his friend another compliment; and the young one
declared he hoped he should always think, and act too, with the dignity
becoming his cloth. After which the doctor took his leave for a while,
and went to Amelia's lodgings.

As soon as he was gone the old gentleman fell very severely on his
son. "Tom," says he, "how can you be such a fool to undo, by your
perverseness, all that I have been doing? Why will you not learn to
study mankind with the attention which I have employed to that purpose?
Do you think, if I had affronted this obstinate old fellow as you do, I
should ever have engaged his friendship?"

"I cannot help it, sir," said Tom: "I have not studied six years at the
university to give up my sentiments to every one. It is true, indeed,
he put together a set of sounding words; but, in the main, I never heard
any one talk more foolishly."

"What of that?" cries the father; "I never told you he was a wise man,
nor did I ever think him so. If he had any understanding, he would have
been a bishop long ago, to my certain knowledge. But, indeed, he hath
been always a fool in private life; for I question whether he is worth
L100 in the world, more than his annual income. He hath given away above
half his fortune to the Lord knows who. I believe I have had above L200
of him, first and last; and would you lose such a milch-cow as this for
want of a few compliments? Indeed, Tom, thou art as great a simpleton as
himself. How do you expect to rise in the church if you cannot temporise
and give in to the opinions of your superiors?"

"I don't know, sir," cries Tom, "what you mean by my superiors. In one
sense, I own, a doctor of divinity is superior to a bachelor of arts,
and so far I am ready to allow his superiority; but I understand Greek
and Hebrew as well as he, and will maintain my opinion against him, or
any other in the schools."

"Tom," cries the old gentleman, "till thou gettest the better of thy
conceit I shall never have any hopes of thee. If thou art wise, thou
wilt think every man thy superior of whom thou canst get anything;
at least thou wilt persuade him that thou thinkest so, and that is
sufficient. Tom, Tom, thou hast no policy in thee."

"What have I been learning these seven years," answered he, "in the
university? However, father, I can account for your opinion. It is the
common failing of old men to attribute all wisdom to themselves. Nestor
did it long ago: but, if you will inquire my character at college, I
fancy you will not think I want to go to school again."

The father and son then went to take their walk, during which the former
repeated many good lessons of policy to his son, not greatly perhaps to
his edification. In truth, if the old gentleman's fondness had not in a
great measure blinded him to the imperfections of his son, he would
have soon perceived that he was sowing all his instructions in a soil
so choaked with self-conceit that it was utterly impossible they should
ever bear any fruit.




BOOK X.



Chapter i.

_To which we will prefix no preface_.


The doctor found Amelia alone, for Booth was gone to walk with his
new-revived acquaintance, Captain Trent, who seemed so pleased with the
renewal of his intercourse with his old brother-officer, that he had
been almost continually with him from the time of their meeting at the
drum.

Amelia acquainted the doctor with the purport of her message, as
follows: "I ask your pardon, my dear sir, for troubling you so often
with my affairs; but I know your extreme readiness, as well as ability,
to assist any one with your advice. The fact is, that my husband hath
been presented by Colonel James with two tickets for a masquerade, which
is to be in a day or two, and he insists so strongly on my going with
him, that I really do not know how to refuse without giving him some
reason; and I am not able to invent any other than the true one, which
you would not, I am sure, advise me to communicate to him. Indeed I
had a most narrow escape the other day; for I was almost drawn in
inadvertently by a very strange accident, to acquaint him with the
whole matter." She then related the serjeant's dream, with all the
consequences that attended it.

The doctor considered a little with himself, and then said, "I am
really, child, puzzled as well as you about this matter. I would by no
means have you go to the masquerade; I do not indeed like the diversion
itself, as I have heard it described to me; not that I am such a prude
to suspect every woman who goes there of any evil intentions; but it is
a pleasure of too loose and disorderly a kind for the recreation of
a sober mind. Indeed, you have still a stronger and more particular
objection. I will try myself to reason him out of it."

"Indeed it is impossible," answered she; "and therefore I would not set
you about it. I never saw him more set on anything. There is a party,
as they call it, made on the occasion; and he tells me my refusal will
disappoint all."

"I really do not know what to advise you," cries the doctor; "I have
told you I do not approve of these diversions; but yet, as your husband
is so very desirous, I cannot think there will be any harm in going with
him. However, I will consider of it, and do all in my power for you."

Here Mrs. Atkinson came in, and the discourse on this subject ceased;
but soon after Amelia renewed it, saying there was no occasion to keep
anything a secret from her friend. They then fell to debating on the
subject, but could not come to any resolution. But Mrs. Atkinson, who
was in an unusual flow of spirits, cried out, "Fear nothing, my dear
Amelia, two women surely will be too hard for one man. I think, doctor,
it exceeds Virgil:

    _Una dolo divum si faemina victa duorum est_."

"Very well repeated, indeed!" cries the doctor. "Do you understand all
Virgil as well as you seem to do that line?"

"I hope I do, sir," said she, "and Horace too; or else my father threw
away his time to very little purpose in teaching me."

"I ask your pardon, madam," cries the doctor. "I own it was an
impertinent question."

"Not at all, sir," says she; "and if you are one of those who imagine
women incapable of learning, I shall not be offended at it. I know the
common opinion; but

    _Interdum vulgus rectum videt, est ubi peccat_."

"If I was to profess such an opinion, madam," said the doctor, "Madam
Dacier and yourself would bear testimony against me. The utmost indeed
that I should venture would be to question the utility of learning in a
young lady's education."

"I own," said Mrs. Atkinson, "as the world is constituted, it cannot be
as serviceable to her fortune as it will be to that of a man; but
you will allow, doctor, that learning may afford a woman, at least, a
reasonable and an innocent entertainment."

"But I will suppose," cried the doctor, "it may have its inconveniences.
As, for instance, if a learned lady should meet with an unlearned
husband, might she not be apt to despise him?"

"I think not," cries Mrs. Atkinson--"and, if I may be allowed the
instance, I think I have shewn, myself, that women who have learning
themselves can be contented without that qualification in a man."

"To be sure," cries the doctor, "there may be other qualifications which
may have their weight in the balance. But let us take the other side
of the question, and suppose the learned of both sexes to meet in
the matrimonial union, may it not afford one excellent subject of
disputation, which is the most learned?"

"Not at all," cries Mrs. Atkinson; "for, if they had both learning and
good sense, they would soon see on which side the superiority lay."

"But if the learned man," said the doctor, "should be a little
unreasonable in his opinion, are you sure that the learned woman would
preserve her duty to her husband, and submit?"

"But why," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "must we necessarily suppose that a
learned man would be unreasonable?"

"Nay, madam," said the doctor, "I am not your husband; and you shall not
hinder me from supposing what I please. Surely it is not such a paradox
to conceive that a man of learning should be unreasonable. Are there no
unreasonable opinions in very learned authors, even among the critics
themselves? For instance, what can be a more strange, and indeed
unreasonable opinion, than to prefer the Metamorphoses of Ovid to the
AEneid of Virgil?"

"It would be indeed so strange," cries the lady, "that you shall not
persuade me it was ever the opinion of any man."

"Perhaps not," cries the doctor; "and I believe you and I should
not differ in our judgments of any person who maintained such an
opinion--What a taste must he have!"

"A most contemptible one indeed," cries Mrs. Atkinson.

"I am satisfied," cries the doctor. "And in the words of your own
Horace, _Verbum non amplius addam_."

"But how provoking is this," cries Mrs. Atkinson, "to draw one in such
a manner! I protest I was so warm in the defence of my favourite Virgil,
that I was not aware of your design; but all your triumph depends on
a supposition that one should be so unfortunate as to meet with the
silliest fellow in the world."

"Not in the least," cries the doctor. "Doctor Bentley was not such a
person; and yet he would have quarrelled, I am convinced, with any wife
in the world, in behalf of one of his corrections. I don't suppose he
would have given up his _Ingentia Fata_ to an angel."

"But do you think," said she, "if I had loved him, I would have
contended with him?"

"Perhaps you might sometimes," said the doctor, "be of these sentiments;
but you remember your own Virgil--_Varium et mutabile semper faemina_."

"Nay, Amelia," said Mrs. Atkinson, "you are now concerned as well as I
am; for he hath now abused the whole sex, and quoted the severest thing
that ever was said against us, though I allow it is one of the finest."

"With all my heart, my dear," cries Amelia. "I have the advantage of
you, however, for I don't understand him."

"Nor doth she understand much better than yourself," cries the doctor;
"or she would not admire nonsense, even though in Virgil."

"Pardon me, sir," said she.

"And pardon me, madam," cries the doctor, with a feigned seriousness; "I
say, a boy in the fourth form at Eton would be whipt, or would deserve
to be whipt at least, who made the neuter gender agree with the
feminine. You have heard, however, that Virgil left his AEneid
incorrect; and, perhaps, had he lived to correct it, we should not have
seen the faults we now see in it."

"Why, it is very true as you say, doctor," cries Mrs. Atkinson; "there
seems to be a false concord. I protest I never thought of it before."

"And yet this is the Virgil," answered the doctor, "that you are so
fond of, who hath made you all of the neuter gender; or, as we say in
English, he hath made mere animals of you; for, if we translate it thus,

    "Woman is a various and changeable animal,

"there will be no fault, I believe, unless in point of civility to the
ladies."

Mrs. Atkinson had just time to tell the doctor he was a provoking
creature, before the arrival of Booth and his friend put an end to
that learned discourse, in which neither of the parties had greatly
recommended themselves to each other; the doctor's opinion of the lady
being not at all heightened by her progress in the classics, and she,
on the other hand, having conceived a great dislike in her heart towards
the doctor, which would have raged, perhaps, with no less fury from the
consideration that he had been her husband.




Chapter ii.

_What happened at the masquerade_.


From this time to the day of the masquerade nothing happened of
consequence enough to have a place in this history.

On that day Colonel James came to Booth's about nine in the evening,
where he stayed for Mrs. James, who did not come till near eleven. The
four masques then set out together in several chairs, and all proceeded
to the Haymarket.

When they arrived at the Opera-house the colonel and Mrs. James
presently left them; nor did Booth and his lady remain long together,
but were soon divided from each other by different masques.

A domino soon accosted the lady, and had her away to the upper end of
the farthest room on the right hand, where both the masques sat down;
nor was it long before the he domino began to make very fervent love to
the she. It would, perhaps, be tedious to the reader to run through the
whole process, which was not indeed in the most romantick stile. The
lover seemed to consider his mistress as a mere woman of this world, and
seemed rather to apply to her avarice and ambition than to her softer
passions.

As he was not so careful to conceal his true voice as the lady was,
she soon discovered that this lover of her's was no other than her old
friend the peer, and presently a thought suggested itself to her
of making an advantage of this accident. She gave him therefore an
intimation that she knew him, and expressed some astonishment at his
having found her out. "I suspect," says she, "my lord, that you have
a friend in the woman where I now lodge, as well as you had in Mrs.
Ellison." My lord protested the contrary. To which she answered, "Nay,
my lord, do not defend her so earnestly till you are sure I should have
been angry with her."

At these words, which were accompanied with a very bewitching softness,
my lord flew into raptures rather too strong for the place he was in.
These the lady gently checked, and begged him to take care they were
not observed; for that her husband, for aught she knew, was then in the
room.

Colonel James came now up, and said, "So, madam, I have the good fortune
to find you again; I have been extremely miserable since I lost you."
The lady answered in her masquerade voice that she did not know him. "I
am Colonel James," said he, in a whisper. "Indeed, sir," answered she,
"you are mistaken; I have no acquaintance with any Colonel James."
"Madam," answered he, in a whisper likewise, "I am positive I am not
mistaken, you are certainly Mrs. Booth." "Indeed, sir," said she,
"you are very impertinent, and I beg you will leave me." My lord then
interposed, and, speaking in his own voice, assured the colonel that
the lady was a woman of quality, and that they were engaged in a
conversation together; upon which the colonel asked the lady's pardon;
for, as there was nothing remarkable in her dress, he really believed he
had been mistaken.

He then went again a hunting through the rooms, and soon after found
Booth walking without his mask between two ladies, one of whom was in a
blue domino, and the other in the dress of a shepherdess. "Will," cries
the colonel, "do you know what is become of our wives; for I have seen
neither of them since we have been in the room?" Booth answered, "That
he supposed they were both together, and they should find them by and
by." "What!" cries the lady in the blue domino, "are you both come upon
duty then with your wives? as for yours, Mr. Alderman," said she to the
colonel, "I make no question but she is got into much better company
than her husband's." "How can you be so cruel, madam?" said the
shepherdess; "you will make him beat his wife by and by, for he is a
military man I assure you." "In the trained bands, I presume," cries the
domino, "for he is plainly dated from the city." "I own, indeed," cries
the other, "the gentleman smells strongly of Thames-street, and, if I
may venture to guess, of the honourable calling of a taylor."

"Why, what the devil hast thou picked up here?" cries James.

"Upon my soul, I don't know," answered Booth; "I wish you would take one
of them at least."

"What say you, madam?" cries the domino, "will you go with the colonel?
I assure you, you have mistaken your man, for he is no less a person
than the great Colonel James himself."

[Illustration: Booth between the blue domino and a Shepherdess.]

"No wonder, then, that Mr. Booth gives him his choice of us; it is the
proper office of a caterer, in which capacity Mr. Booth hath, I am told,
the honour to serve the noble colonel."

"Much good may it do you with your ladies!" said James; "I will go in
pursuit of better game." At which words he walked off.

"You are a true sportsman," cries the shepherdess; "for your only
pleasure, I believe, lies in the pursuit."

"Do you know the gentleman, madam?" cries the domino.

"Who doth not know him?" answered the shepherdess.

"What is his character?" cries the domino; "for, though I have jested
with him, I only know him by sight."

"I know nothing very particular in his character," cries the
shepherdess. "He gets every handsome woman he can, and so they do all."

"I suppose then he is not married?" said the domino.

"O yes! and married for love too," answered the other; "but he hath
loved away all his love for her long ago, and now, he says, she makes
as fine an object of hatred. I think, if the fellow ever appears to have
any wit, it is when he abuses his wife; and, luckily for him, that is
his favourite topic. I don't know the poor wretch, but, as he describes
her, it is a miserable animal."

"I know her very well," cries the other; "and I am much mistaken if she
is not even with him; but hang him! what is become of Booth?"

At this instant a great noise arose near that part where the two ladies
were. This was occasioned by a large assembly of young fellows whom they
call bucks, who were got together, and were enjoying, as the phrase is,
a letter, which one of them had found in the room.

Curiosity hath its votaries among all ranks of people; whenever
therefore an object of this appears it is as sure of attracting a croud
in the assemblies of the polite as in those of their inferiors.

When this croud was gathered together, one of the bucks, at the desire
of his companions, as well as of all present, performed the part of a
public orator, and read out the following letter, which we shall give
the reader, together with the comments of the orator himself, and of all
his audience.

The orator then, being mounted on a bench, began as follows:

"Here beginneth the first chapter of--saint--Pox on't, Jack, what is the
saint's name? I have forgot."

"Timothy, you blockhead," answered another; "--Timothy."

"Well, then," cries the orator, "of Saint Timothy.

"'SIR,--I am very sorry to have any occasion of writing on the following
subject in a country that is honoured with the name of Christian; much
more am I concerned to address myself to a man whose many advantages,
derived both from nature and fortune, should demand the highest return
of gratitude to the great Giver of all those good things. Is not such a
man guilty of the highest ingratitude to that most beneficent Being, by
a direct and avowed disobedience of his most positive laws and commands?

"'I need not tell you that adultery is forbid in the laws of the
decalogue; nor need I, I hope, mention that it is expressly forbid in
the New Testament.'

"You see, therefore," said the orator, "what the law is, and therefore
none of you will be able to plead ignorance when you come to the Old
Bailey in the other world. But here goes again:--

"'If it had not been so expressly forbidden in Scripture, still the law
of Nature would have yielded light enough for us to have discovered the
great horror and atrociousness of this crime.

"'And accordingly we find that nations, where the Sun of righteousness
hath yet never shined, have punished the adulterer with the most
exemplary pains and penalties; not only the polite heathens, but the
most barbarous nations, have concurred in these; in many places the most
severe and shameful corporal punishments, and in some, and those not a
few, death itself hath been inflicted on this crime.

"'And sure in a human sense there is scarce any guilt which deserves
to be more severely punished. It includes in it almost every injury and
every mischief which one man can do to, or can bring on, another. It is
robbing him of his property--'

"Mind that, ladies," said the orator; "you are all the property of your
husbands.--'And of that property which, if he is a good man, he values
above all others. It is poisoning that fountain whence he hath a right
to derive the sweetest and most innocent pleasure, the most cordial
comfort, the most solid friendship, and most faithful assistance in all
his affairs, wants, and distresses. It is the destruction of his peace
of mind, and even of his reputation. The ruin of both wife and husband,
and sometimes of the whole family, are the probable consequence of this
fatal injury. Domestic happiness is the end of almost all our pursuits,
and the common reward of all our pains. When men find themselves
for ever barred from this delightful fruition, they are lost to all
industry, and grow careless of all their worldly affairs. Thus they
become bad subjects, bad relations, bad friends, and bad men. Hatred and
revenge are the wretched passions which boil in their minds. Despair
and madness very commonly ensue, and murder and suicide often close the
dreadful scene.'

"Thus, gentlemen and ladies, you see the scene is closed. So here ends
the first act--and thus begins the second:--

"'I have here attempted to lay before you a picture of this vice, the
horror of which no colours of mine can exaggerate. But what pencil can
delineate the horrors of that punishment which the Scripture denounces
against it?

"'And for what will you subject yourself to this punishment? or for what
reward will you inflict all this misery on another? I will add, on your
friend? for the possession of a woman; for the pleasure of a moment?
But, if neither virtue nor religion can restrain your inordinate
appetites, are there not many women as handsome as your friend's wife,
whom, though not with innocence, you may possess with a much less degree
of guilt? What motive then can thus hurry you on to the destruction of
yourself and your friend? doth the peculiar rankness of the guilt add
any zest to the sin? doth it enhance the pleasure as much as we may be
assured it will the punishment?

"'But if you can be so lost to all sense of fear, and of shame, and of
goodness, as not to be debarred by the evil which you are to bring on
yourself, by the extreme baseness of the action, nor by the ruin in
which you are to involve others, let me still urge the difficulty, I may
say, the impossibility of the success. You are attacking a fortress on
a rock; a chastity so strongly defended, as well by a happy natural
disposition of mind as by the strongest principles of religion and
virtue, implanted by education and nourished and improved by habit,
that the woman must be invincible even without that firm and
constant affection of her husband which would guard a much looser and
worse-disposed heart. What therefore are you attempting but to introduce
distrust, and perhaps disunion, between an innocent and a happy couple,
in which too you cannot succeed without bringing, I am convinced,
certain destruction on your own head?

"'Desist, therefore, let me advise you, from this enormous crime;
retreat from the vain attempt of climbing a precipice which it is
impossible you should ever ascend, where you must probably soon fall
into utter perdition, and can have no other hope but of dragging down
your best friend into perdition with you.

"'I can think of but one argument more, and that, indeed, a very bad
one; you throw away that time in an impossible attempt, which might, in
other places, crown your sinful endeavours with success.'

"And so ends the dismal ditty."

"D--n me," cries one, "did ever mortal hear such d--ned stuff?"

"Upon my soul," said another, "I like the last argument well enough.
There is some sense in that; for d--n me if I had not rather go to
D--g--ss at any time than follow a virtuous b---- for a fortnight."

"Tom," says one of them, "let us set the ditty to music; let us
subscribe to have it set by Handel; it will make an excellent oratorio."

"D--n me, Jack," says another, "we'll have it set to a psalm-tune, and
we'll sing it next Sunday at St James's church, and I'll bear a bob,
d--n me."

"Fie upon it! gentlemen, fie upon it!" said a frier, who came up; "do
you think there is any wit and humour in this ribaldry; or, if there
were, would it make any atonement for abusing religion and virtue?"

"Heyday!" cries one, "this is a frier in good earnest."

"Whatever I am," said the frier, "I hope at least you are what you
appear to be. Heaven forbid, for the sake of our posterity, that you
should be gentlemen."

"Jack," cries one, "let us toss the frier in a blanket."

"Me in a blanket?" said the frier: "by the dignity of man, I will twist
the neck of every one of you as sure as ever the neck of a dunghill-cock
was twisted." At which words he pulled off his mask, and the tremendous
majesty of Colonel Bath appeared, from which the bucks fled away as fast
as the Trojans heretofore from the face of Achilles. The colonel did not
think it worth while to pursue any other of them except him who had
the letter in his hand, which the colonel desired to see, and the other
delivered, saying it was very much at his service.

The colonel being possessed of the letter, retired as privately as he
could, in order to give it a careful perusal; for, badly as it had been
read by the orator, there were some passages in it which had pleased
the colonel. He had just gone through it when Booth passed by him; upon
which the colonel called to him, and, delivering him the letter, bid him
put it in his pocket and read it at his leisure. He made many encomiums
upon it, and told Booth it would be of service to him, and was proper
for all young men to read.

Booth had not yet seen his wife; but, as he concluded she was safe with
Mrs. James, he was not uneasy. He had been prevented searching farther
after her by the lady in the blue domino, who had joined him again.
Booth had now made these discoveries: that the lady was pretty well
acquainted with him, that she was a woman of fashion, and that she had
a particular regard for him. But, though he was a gay man, he was
in reality so fond of his Amelia, that he thought of no other woman;
wherefore, though not absolutely a Joseph, as we have already seen, yet
could he not be guilty of premeditated inconstancy. He was indeed so
very cold and insensible to the hints which were given him, that the
lady began to complain of his dullness. When the shepherdess again came
up and heard this accusation against him, she confirmed it, saying, "I
do assure you, madam, he is the dullest fellow in the world. Indeed, I
should almost take you for his wife, by finding you a second time with
him; for I do assure you the gentleman very seldom keeps any other
company." "Are you so well acquainted with him, madam?" said the domino.
"I have had that honour longer than your ladyship, I believe," answered
the shepherdess. "Possibly you may, madam," cries the domino; "but I
wish you would not interrupt us at present, for we have some business
together." "I believe, madam," answered the shepherdess, "my business
with the gentleman is altogether as important as yours; and therefore
your ladyship may withdraw if you please." "My dear ladies," cries
Booth, "I beg you will not quarrel about me." "Not at all," answered the
domino; "since you are so indifferent, I resign my pretensions with
all my heart. If you had not been the dullest fellow upon earth, I am
convinced you must have discovered me." She then went off, muttering
to herself that she was satisfied the shepherdess was some wretched
creature whom nobody knew.

The shepherdess overheard the sarcasm, and answered it by asking Booth
what contemptible wretch he had picked up? "Indeed, madam," said he,
"you know as much of her as I do; she is a masquerade acquaintance like
yourself." "some to guide
us, they shrunk up their shoulders as Frenchmen do when they are afraid
to undertake a thing. When we asked them about the lions and wild
creatures, they laughed, and let us know that they would do us no hurt,
and directed us to a good way indeed to deal with them, and that was to
make some fire, which would always fright them away; and so indeed we
found it.

Upon these encouragements we resolved upon our journey, and many
considerations put us upon it, which, had the thing itself been
practicable, we were not so much to blame for as it might otherwise be
supposed; I will name some of them, not to make the account too tedious.

First, we were perfectly destitute of means to work about our own
deliverance any other way; we were on shore in a place perfectly remote
from all European navigation; so that we could never think of being
relieved, and fetched off by any of our own countrymen in that part of
the world. Secondly, if we had adventured to have sailed on along the
coast of Mozambique, and the desolate shores of Africa to the north,
till we came to the Red Sea, all we could hope for there was to be taken
by the Arabs, and be sold for slaves to the Turks, which to all of us
was little better than death. We could not build anything of a vessel
that would carry us over the great Arabian Sea to India, nor could we
reach the Cape de Bona Speranza, the winds being too variable, and the
sea in that latitude too tempestuous; but we all knew, if we could cross
this continent of land, we might reach some of the great rivers that run
into the Atlantic Ocean; and that, on the banks of any of those rivers,
we might there build us canoes which would carry us down, if it were
thousands of miles, so that we could want nothing but food, of which we
were assured we might kill sufficient with our guns; and to add to the
satisfaction of our deliverance, we concluded we might, every one of
us, get a quantity of gold, which, if we came safe, would infinitely
recompense us for our toil.

I cannot say that in all our consultations I ever began to enter into
the weight and merit of any enterprise we went upon till now. My view
before was, as I thought, very good, viz., that we should get into the
Arabian Gulf, or the mouth of the Red Sea; and waiting for some vessel
passing or repassing there, of which there is plenty, have seized upon
the first we came at by force, and not only have enriched ourselves with
her cargo, but have carried ourselves to what part of the world we had
pleased; but when they came to talk to me of a march of 2000 or 3000
miles on foot, of wandering in deserts among lions and tigers, I confess
my blood ran chill, and I used all the arguments I could to persuade
them against it.

But they were all positive, and I might as well have held my tongue; so
I submitted, and told them I would keep to our first law, to be governed
by the majority, and we resolved upon our journey. The first thing we
did was to take an observation, and see whereabouts in the world we
were, which we did, and found we were in the latitude of 12 degrees 35
minutes south of the line. The next thing was to look on the charts, and
see the coast of the country we aimed at, which we found to be from 8 to
11 degrees south latitude, if we went for the coast of Angola, or in 12
to 29 degrees north latitude, if we made for the river Niger, and the
coast of Guinea.

Our aim was for the coast of Angola, which, by the charts we had, lying
very near the same latitude we were then in, our course thither was due
west; and as we were assured we should meet with rivers, we doubted not
but that by their help we might ease our journey, especially if we could
find means to cross the great lake, or inland sea, which the natives
call Coalmucoa, out of which it is said the river Nile has its source
or beginning; but we reckoned without our host, as you will see in the
sequel of our story.

The next thing we had to consider was, how to carry our baggage, which
we were first of all determined not to travel without; neither indeed
was it possible for us to do so, for even our ammunition, which was
absolutely necessary to us, and on which our subsistence, I mean for
food, as well as our safety, and particularly our defence against wild
beasts and wild men, depended,--I say, even our ammunition was a load
too heavy for us to carry in a country where the heat was such that we
should be load enough for ourselves.

We inquired in the country, and found there was no beast of burthen
known among them, that is to say, neither horses or mules, or asses,
camels, or dromedaries; the only creature they had was a kind of
buffalo, or tame bull, such a one as we had killed; and that some of
these they had brought so to their hand, that they taught them to go and
come with their voices, as they called them to them, or sent them from
them; that they made them carry burthens; and particularly that they
would swim over rivers and lakes upon them, the creatures swimming very
high and strong in the water.

But we understood nothing of the management of guiding such a
creature, or how to bind a burthen upon them; and this last part of our
consultation puzzled us extremely. At last I proposed a method for them,
which, after some consideration, they found very convenient; and this
was, to quarrel with some of the negro natives, take ten or twelve of
them prisoners, and binding them as slaves, cause them to travel with
us, and make them carry our baggage; which I alleged would be convenient
and useful many ways as well to show us the way, as to converse with
other natives for us.

This counsel was not accepted at first, but the natives soon gave them
reason to approve it, and also gave them an opportunity to put it in
practice; for, as our little traffic with the natives was hitherto upon
the faith of their first kindness, we found some knavery among them at
last; for having bought some cattle of them for our toys, which, as
I said, our cutler had contrived, one of our men differing with his
chapman, truly they huffed him in their manner, and, keeping the things
he had offered them for the cattle, made their fellows drive away the
cattle before his face, and laugh at him. Our man crying out loud of
this violence, and calling to some of us who were not far off, the negro
he was dealing with threw a lance at him, which came so true, that, if
he had not with great agility jumped aside, and held up his hand also
to turn the lance as it came, it had struck through his body; and, as it
was, it wounded him in the arm; at which the man, enraged, took up his
fuzee, and shot the negro through the heart.

The others that were near him, and all those that were with us at
a distance, were so terribly frighted, first, at the flash of fire;
secondly, at the noise; and thirdly, at seeing their countryman killed,
that they stood like men stupid and amazed, at first, for some time; but
after they were a little recovered from their fright, one of them, at a
good distance from us, set up a sudden screaming noise, which, it
seems, is the noise they make when they go to fight; and all the rest
understanding what he meant, answered him, and ran together to the place
where he was, and we not knowing what it meant, stood still, looking
upon one another like a parcel of fools.

But we were presently undeceived; for, in two or three minutes more,
we heard the screaming roaring noise go on from one place to another,
through all their little towns; nay, even over the creek to the other
side; and, on a sudden, we saw a naked multitude running from all parts
to the place where the first man began it, as to a rendezvous; and, in
less than an hour, I believe there was near 500 of them gotten together,
armed some with bows and arrows, but most with lances, which they throw
at a good distance, so nicely that they will strike a bird flying.

We had but a very little time for consultation, for the multitude was
increasing every moment; and I verily believe, if we had stayed long,
they would have been 10,000 together in a little time. We had nothing
to do, therefore, but to fly to our ship or bark, where indeed we could
have defended ourselves very well, or to advance and try what a volley
or two of small shot would do for us.

We resolved immediately upon the latter, depending upon it that the fire
and terror of our shot would soon put them to flight; so we drew up all
in a line, and marched boldly up to them. They stood ready to meet us,
depending, I suppose, to destroy us all with their lances; but before
we came near enough for them to throw their lances, we halted, and,
standing at a good distance from one another, to stretch our line as far
as we could, we gave them a salute with our shot, which, besides what we
wounded that we knew not of, knocked sixteen of them down upon the spot,
and three more were so lamed, that they fell about twenty or thirty
yards from them.

As soon as we had fired, they set up the horridest yell, or howling,
partly raised by those that were wounded, and partly by those that
pitied and condoled the bodies they saw lie dead, that I never heard
anything like it before or since.

We stood stock still after we had fired, to load our guns again, and
finding they did not stir from the place we fired among them again; we
killed about nine of them at the second fire; but as they did not stand
so thick as before, all our men did not fire, seven of us being ordered
to reserve our charge, and to advance as soon as the other had fired,
while the rest loaded again; of which I shall speak again presently.

As soon as we had fired the second volley, we shouted as loud as we
could, and the seven men advanced upon them, and, coming about twenty
yards nearer, fired again, and those that were behind having loaded
again with all expedition, followed; but when they saw us advance, they
ran screaming away as if they were bewitched.

When we came up to the field of battle, we saw a great number of bodies
lying upon the ground, many more than we could suppose were killed or
wounded; nay, more than we had bullets in our pieces when we fired; and
we could not tell what to make of it; but at length we found how it
was, viz., that they were frighted out of all manner of sense; nay, I do
believe several of those that were really dead, were frighted to death,
and had no wound about them.

Of those that were thus frighted, as I have said, several of them, as
they recovered themselves, came and worshipped us (taking us for gods or
devils, I know not which, nor did it much matter to us): some kneeling,
some throwing themselves flat on the ground, made a thousand antic
gestures, but all with tokens of the most profound submission. It
presently came into my head, that we might now, by the law of arms, take
as many prisoners as we would, and make them travel with us, and carry
our baggage. As soon as I proposed it, our men were all of my mind; and
accordingly we secured about sixty lusty young fellows, and let them
know they must go with us; which they seemed very willing to do. But
the next question we had among ourselves, was, how we should do to trust
them, for we found the people not like those of Madagascar, but fierce,
revengeful, and treacherous; for which reason we were sure that we
should have no service from them but that of mere slaves; no subjection
that would continue any longer than the fear of us was upon them, nor
any labour but by violence.

Before I go any farther, I must hint to the reader, that from this time
forward I began to enter a little more seriously into the circumstance
I was in, and concerned myself more in the conduct of our affairs; for
though my comrades were all older men, yet I began to find them void of
counsel, or, as I now call it, presence of mind, when they came to the
execution of a thing. The first occasion I took to observe this, was in
their late engagement with the natives, when, though they had taken a
good resolution to attack them and fire upon them, yet, when they had
fired the first time, and found that the negroes did not run as they
expected, their hearts began to fail, and I am persuaded, if their bark
had been near hand, they would every man have run away.

Upon this occasion I began to take upon me a little to hearten them
up, and to call upon them to load again, and give them another volley,
telling them that I would engage, if they would be ruled by me, I'd make
the negroes run fast enough. I found this heartened them, and therefore,
when they fired a second time, I desired them to reserve some of their
shot for an attempt by itself, as I mentioned above.

Having fired a second time, I was indeed forced to command, as I may
call it. "Now, seigniors," said I, "let us give them a cheer." So I
opened my throat, and shouted three times, as our English sailors do on
like occasions. "And now follow me," said I to the seven that had not
fired, "and I'll warrant you we will make work with them," and so it
proved indeed; for, as soon as they saw us coming, away they ran, as
above.

From this day forward they would call me nothing but Seignior Capitanio;
but I told them I would not be called seignior. "Well, then," said the
gunner, who spoke good English, "you shall be called Captain Bob;" and
so they gave me my title ever after.

Nothing is more certain of the Portuguese than this, take them
nationally or personally, if they are animated and heartened up by
anybody to go before, and encourage them by example, they will behave
well enough; but if they have nothing but their own measures to follow,
they sink immediately: these men had certainly fled from a parcel of
naked savages, though even by flying they could not have saved their
lives, if I had not shouted and hallooed, and rather made sport with the
thing than a fight, to keep up their courage.

Nor was there less need of it upon several occasions hereafter; and I do
confess I have often wondered how a number of men, who, when they came
to the extremity, were so ill supported by their own spirits, had
at first courage to propose and to undertake the most desperate and
impracticable attempt that ever men went about in the world.

There were indeed two or three indefatigable men among them, by whose
courage and industry all the rest were upheld; and indeed those two or
three were the managers of them from the beginning; that was the gunner,
and that cutler whom I call the artist; and the third, who was pretty
well, though not like either of them, was one of the carpenters. These
indeed were the life and soul of all the rest, and it was to their
courage that all the rest owed the resolution they showed upon any
occasion. But when those saw me take a little upon me, as above, they
embraced me, and treated me with particular affection ever after.

This gunner was an excellent mathematician, a good scholar, and a
complete sailor; and it was in conversing intimately with him that I
learned afterwards the grounds of what knowledge I have since had in all
the sciences useful for navigation, and particularly in the geographical
part of knowledge.

Even in our conversation, finding me eager to understand and learn, he
laid the foundation of a general knowledge of things in my mind, gave
me just ideas of the form of the earth and of the sea, the situation of
countries, the course of rivers, the doctrine of the spheres, the motion
of the stars; and, in a word, taught me a kind of system of astronomy,
which I afterwards improved.

In an especial manner, he filled my head with aspiring thoughts, and
with an earnest desire after learning everything that could be taught
me; convincing me, that nothing could qualify me for great undertakings,
but a degree of learning superior to what was usual in the race of
seamen; he told me, that to be ignorant was to be certain of a
mean station in the world, but that knowledge was the first step to
preferment. He was always flattering me with my capacity to learn; and
though that fed my pride, yet, on the other hand, as I had a secret
ambition, which just at that time fed itself in my mind, it prompted in
me an insatiable thirst after learning in general, and I resolved, if
ever I came back to Europe, and had anything left to purchase it, I
would make myself master of all the parts of learning needful to
the making of me a complete sailor; but I was not so just to myself
afterwards as to do it when I had an opportunity.

But to return to our business; the gunner, when he saw the service I
had done in the fight, and heard my proposal for keeping a number of
prisoners for our march, and for carrying our baggage, turns to me
before them all. "Captain Bob," says he, "I think you must be our
leader, for all the success of this enterprise is owing to you." "No,
no," said I, "do not compliment me; you shall be our Seignior Capitanio,
you shall be general; I am too young for it." So, in short, we all
agreed he should be our leader; but he would not accept of it alone, but
would have me joined with him; and all the rest agreeing, I was obliged
to comply.

The first piece of service they put me upon in this new command was
as difficult as any they could think of, and that was to manage the
prisoners; which, however, I cheerfully undertook, as you shall hear
presently. But the immediate consultation was yet of more consequence;
and that was, first, which way we should go; and secondly, how to
furnish ourselves for the voyage with provisions.

There was among the prisoners one tall, well-shaped, handsome fellow,
to whom the rest seemed to pay great respect, and who, as we understood
afterwards, was the son of one of their kings; his father was, it seems,
killed at our first volley, and he wounded with a shot in his arm, and
with another just on one of his hips or haunches. The shot in his haunch
being in a fleshy part, bled much, and he was half dead with the loss of
blood. As to the shot in his arm, it had broke his wrist, and he was by
both these wounds quite disabled, so that we were once going to turn him
away, and let him die; and, if we had, he would have died indeed in a
few days more: but, as I found the man had some respect showed him, it
presently occurred to my thoughts that we might bring him to be useful
to us, and perhaps make him a kind of commander over them. So I caused
our surgeon to take him in hand, and gave the poor wretch good words,
that is to say, I spoke to him as well as I could by signs, to make him
understand that we would make him well again.

This created a new awe in their minds of us, believing that, as we could
kill at a distance by something invisible to them (for so our shot was,
to be sure), so we could make them well again too. Upon this the young
prince (for so we called him afterwards) called six or seven of the
savages to him, and said something to them; what it was we know not, but
immediately all the seven came to me, and kneeled down to me, holding up
their hands, and making signs of entreaty, pointing to the place where
one of those lay whom we had killed.

It was a long time before I or any of us could understand them; but one
of them ran and lifted up a dead man, pointing to his wound, which was
in his eyes, for he was shot into the head at one of his eyes. Then
another pointed to the surgeon, and at last we found it out, that the
meaning was, that he should heal the prince's father too, who was dead,
being shot through the head, as above.

We presently took the hint, and would not say we could not do it, but
let them know, the men that were killed were those that had first fallen
upon us, and provoked us, and we would by no means make them alive
again; and that, if any others did so, we would kill them too, and never
let them live any more: but that, if he (the prince) would be willing
to go with us, and do as we should direct him, we would not let him die,
and would make his arm well. Upon this he bid his men go and fetch a
long stick or staff, and lay on the ground. When they brought it, we saw
it was an arrow; he took it with his left hand (for his other was lame
with the wound), and, pointing up at the sun, broke the arrow in two,
and set the point against his breast, and then gave it to me. This was,
as I understood afterwards, wishing the sun, whom they worship, might
shoot him into the breast with an arrow, if ever he failed to be my
friend; and giving the point of the arrow to me was to be a testimony
that I was the man he had sworn to: and never was Christian more
punctual to an oath than he was to this, for he was a sworn servant to
us for many a weary month after that.

When I brought him to the surgeon, he immediately dressed the wound in
his haunch or buttock, and found the bullet had only grazed upon the
flesh, and passed, as it were, by it, but it was not lodged in the part,
so that it was soon healed and well again; but, as to his arm, he found
one of the bones broken, which are in the fore-part from the wrist to
the elbow; and this he set, and splintered it up, and bound his arm in a
sling, hanging it about his neck, and making signs to him that he should
not stir it; which he was so strict an observer of, that he set him
down, and never moved one way or other but as the surgeon gave him
leave.

I took a great deal of pains to acquaint this negro what we intended
to do, and what use we intended to make of his men; and particularly
to teach him the meaning of what we said, especially to teach him some
words, such as yes and no, and what they meant, and to inure him to
our way of talking; and he was very willing and apt to learn anything I
taught him.

It was easy to let him see that we intended to carry our provision with
us from the first day; but he made signs to us to tell us we need not,
for we should find provision enough everywhere for forty days. It was
very difficult for us to understand how he expressed forty; for he
knew no figures, but some words that they used to one another that they
understood it by. At last one of the negroes, by his order, laid forty
little stones one by another, to show us how many days we should travel,
and find provisions sufficient.

Then I showed him our baggage, which was very heavy, particularly our
powder, shot, lead, iron, carpenters' tools, seamen's instruments, cases
of bottles, and other lumber. He took some of the things up in his hand
to feel the weight, and shook his head at them; so I told our people
they must resolve to divide their things into small parcels, and make
them portable; and accordingly they did so, by which means we were fain
to leave all our chests behind us, which were eleven in number.

Then he made signs to us that he would procure some buffaloes, or young
bulls, as I called them, to carry things for us, and made signs, too,
that if we were weary, we might be carried too; but that we slighted,
only were willing to have the creatures, because, at last, when they
could serve us no farther for carriage, we might eat them all up if we
had any occasion for them.

I then carried him to our bark, and showed him what things we had here.
He seemed amazed at the sight of our bark, having never seen anything
of that kind before, for their boats are most wretched things, such as
I never saw before, having no head or stern, and being made only of the
skins of goats, sewed together with dried guts of goats and sheep, and
done over with a kind of slimy stuff like rosin and oil, but of a most
nauseous, odious smell; and they are poor miserable things for boats,
the worst that any part of the world ever saw; a canoe is an excellent
contrivance compared to them.

But to return to our boat. We carried our new prince into it, and helped
him over the side, because of his lameness. We made signs to him that
his men must carry our goods for us, and showed him what we had; he
answered, "Si, Seignior," or, "Yes, sir" (for we had taught him that
word and the meaning of it), and taking up a bundle, he made signs to
us, that when his arm was well he would carry some for us.

I made signs again to tell him, that if he would make his men carry
them, we would not let him carry anything. We had secured all the
prisoners in a narrow place, where we had bound them with mat cords, and
set up stakes like a palisado round them; so, when we carried the prince
on shore, we went with him to them, and made signs to him to ask them if
they were willing to go with us to the country of lions. Accordingly he
made a long speech to them, and we could understand by it that he told
them, if they were willing, they must say, "Si, Seignior," telling
them what it signified. They immediately answered, "Si, Seignior," and
clapped their hands, looking up to the sun, which, the prince signified
to us, was swearing to be faithful. But as soon as they had said so, one
of them made a long speech to the prince; and in it we perceived, by his
gestures, which were very antic, that they desired something from us,
and that they were in great concern about it. So I asked him, as well as
I could, what it was they desired of us; he told us by signs that they
desired we should clap our hands to the sun (that was, to swear) that we
would not kill them, that we would give them chiaruck, that is to say,
bread, would not starve them, and would not let the lions eat them.
I told him we would promise all that; then he pointed to the sun, and
clapped his hands, signing to me that I should do so too, which I did;
at which all the prisoners fell flat on the ground, and rising up again,
made the oddest, wildest cries that ever I heard.

I think it was the first time in my life that ever any religious thought
affected me; but I could not refrain some reflections, and almost tears,
in considering how happy it was that I was not born among such creatures
as these, and was not so stupidly ignorant and barbarous; but this soon
went off again, and I was not troubled again with any qualms of that
sort for a long time after.

When this ceremony was over, our concern was to get some provisions,
as well for the present subsistence of our prisoners as ourselves; and
making signs to our prince that we were thinking upon that subject, he
made signs to me that, if I would let one of the prisoners go to his
town, he should bring provisions, and should bring some beasts to carry
our baggage. I seemed loth to trust him, and supposing that he would
run away, he made great signs of fidelity, and with his own hands tied a
rope about his neck, offering me one end of it, intimating that I should
hang him if the man did not come again. So I consented, and he gave him
abundance of instructions, and sent him away, pointing to the light of
the sun, which it seems was to tell him at what time he must be back.

The fellow ran as if he was mad, and held it till he was quite out of
sight, by which I supposed he had a great way to go. The next morning,
about two hours before the time appointed, the black prince, for so I
always called him, beckoning with his hand to me, and hallooing after
his manner, desired me to come to him, which I did, when, pointing to a
little hill about two miles off, I saw plainly a little drove of cattle,
and several people with them; those, he told me by signs, were the man
he had sent, and several more with him, and cattle for us.

Accordingly, by the time appointed, he came quite to our huts, and
brought with him a great many cows, young runts, about sixteen goats,
and four young bulls, taught to carry burthens.

This was a supply of provisions sufficient; as for bread, we were
obliged to shift with some roots which we had made use of before. We
then began to consider of making some large bags like the soldiers'
knapsacks, for their men to carry our baggage in, and to make it easy
to them; and the goats being killed, I ordered the skins to be spread
in the sun, and they were as dry in two days as could be desired; so we
found means to make such little bags as we wanted, and began to divide
our baggage into them. When the black prince found what they were for,
and how easy they were of carriage when we put them on, he smiled a
little, and sent away the man again to fetch skins, and he brought two
natives more with him, all loaded with skins better cured than ours, and
of other kinds, such as we could not tell what names to give them.

These two men brought the black prince two lances, of the sort they use
in their fights, but finer than ordinary, being made of black smooth
wood, as fine as ebony, and headed at the point with the end of a long
tooth of some creature--we could not tell of what creature; the head was
so firm put on, and the tooth so strong, though no bigger than my thumb,
and sharp at the end, that I never saw anything like it in any place in
the world.

The prince would not take them till I gave him leave, but made signs
that they should give them to me; however, I gave him leave to take them
himself, for I saw evident signs of an honourable just principle in him.

We now prepared for our march, when the prince coming to me, and
pointing towards the several quarters of the world, made signs to know
which way we intended to go; and when I showed him, pointing to the
west, he presently let me know there was a great river a little further
to the north, which was able to carry our bark many leagues into the
country due west. I presently took the hint, and inquired for the mouth
of the river, which I understood by him was above a day's march, and, by
our estimation, we found it about seven leagues further. I take this to
be the great river marked by our chart-makers at the northmost part of
the coast of Mozambique, and called there Quilloa.

Consulting thus with ourselves, we resolved to take the prince, and as
many of the prisoners as we could stow in our frigate, and go about
by the bay into the river; and that eight of us, with our arms, should
march by land to meet them on the river side; for the prince, carrying
us to a rising ground, had showed us the river very plain, a great way
up the country, and in one place it was not above six miles to it.

It was my lot to march by land, and be captain of the whole caravan.
I had eight of our men with me, and seven-and-thirty of our prisoners,
without any baggage, for all our luggage was yet on board. We drove the
young bulls with us; nothing was ever so tame, so willing to work, or
carry anything. The negroes would ride upon them four at a time, and
they would go very willingly. They would eat out of our hand, lick our
feet, and were as tractable as a dog.

We drove with us six or seven cows for food; but our negroes knew
nothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them
the way, and then they were mighty willing to do so as long as we had
any salt to do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we
found we should have no more.

It was an easy march to the river side for us that went by land, and
we came thither in a piece of a day, being, as above, no more than six
English miles; whereas it was no less than five days before they came
to us by water, the wind in the bay having failed them, and the way, by
reason of a great turn or reach in the river, being about fifty miles
about.

We spent this time in a thing which the two strangers, which brought the
prince the two lances, put into the head of the prisoners, viz., to make
bottles of the goats' skins to carry fresh water in, which it seems they
knew we should come to want; and the men did it so dexterously, having
dried skins fetched them by those two men, that before our vessel came
up, they had every man a pouch like a bladder, to carry fresh water in,
hanging over their shoulders by a thong made of other skins, about three
inches broad, like the sling of a fuzee.

Our prince, to assure us of the fidelity of the men in this march,
had ordered them to be tied two and two by the wrist, as we handcuff
prisoners in England; and made them so sensible of the reasonableness of
it, that he made them do it themselves, appointing four of them to bind
the rest; but we found them so honest, and particularly so obedient
to him, that after we were gotten a little further off of their own
country, we set them at liberty, though, when he came to us, he would
have them tied again, and they continued so a good while.

All the country on the bank of the river was a high land, no marshy
swampy ground in it; the verdure good, and abundance of cattle feeding
upon it wherever we went, or which way soever we looked; there was
not much wood indeed, at least not near us; but further up we saw oak,
cedar, and pine-trees, some of which were very large.

The river was a fair open channel, about as broad as the Thames below
Gravesend, and a strong tide of flood, which we found held us about
sixty miles; the channel deep, nor did we find any want of water for a
great way. In short, we went merrily up the river with the flood and
the wind blowing still fresh at E. and E.N.E. We stemmed the ebb easily
also, especially while the river continued broad and deep; but when we
came past the swelling of the tide, and had the natural current of the
river to go against, we found it too strong for us, and began to think
of quitting our bark; but the prince would by no means agree to that,
for, finding we had on board pretty good store of roping made of mats
and flags, which I described before, he ordered all the prisoners which
were on shore to come and take hold of those ropes, and tow us along by
the shore side; and as we hoisted our sail too, to ease them, the men
ran along with us at a very great rate.

In this manner the river carried us up, by our computation, near 200
miles, and then it narrowed apace, and was not above as broad as the
Thames is at Windsor, or thereabouts; and, after another day, we came
to a great waterfall or cataract, enough to fright us, for I believe the
whole body of water fell at once perpendicularly down a precipice
above sixty foot high, which made noise enough to deprive men of their
hearing, and we heard it above ten miles before we came to it.

Here we were at a full stop, and now our prisoners went first on shore;
they had worked very hard and very cheerfully, relieving one another,
those that were weary being taken into the bark. Had we had canoes or
any boats which might have been carried by men's strength we might have
gone two hundred miles more up this river in small boats, but our great
boat could go no farther.

All this way the country looked green and pleasant, and was full of
cattle, and some people we saw, though not many; but this we observed
now, that the people did no more understand our prisoners here than
we could understand them; being, it seems, of different nations and of
different speech. We had yet seen no wild beasts, or, at least, none
that came very near us, except two days before we came to the waterfall,
when we saw three of the most beautiful leopards that ever were seen,
standing upon the bank of the river on the north side, our prisoners
being all on the other side of the water. Our gunner espied them first,
and ran to fetch his gun, putting a ball extraordinary in it; and coming
to me, "Now, Captain Bob," says he, "where is your prince?" So I called
him out. "Now," says he, "tell your men not to be afraid; tell them they
shall see that thing in his hand speak in fire to one of those beasts,
and make it kill itself."

The poor negroes looked as if they had been all going to be killed,
notwithstanding what their prince said to them, and stood staring to
expect the issue, when on a sudden the gunner fired; and as he was a
very good marksman, he shot the creature with two slugs, just in the
head. As soon as the leopard felt herself struck, she reared up on her
two hind-legs, bolt upright, and throwing her forepaws about in the air,
fell backward, growling and struggling, and immediately died; the other
two, frighted with the fire and the noise, fled, and were out of sight
in an instant.

But the two frighted leopards were not in half the consternation that
our prisoners were; four or five of them fell down as if they had been
shot; several others fell on their knees, and lifted up their hands to
us; whether to worship us, or pray us not to kill them, we did not know;
but we made signs to their prince to encourage them, which he did, but
it was with much ado that he brought them to their senses. Nay, the
prince, notwithstanding all that was said to prepare him for it, yet
when the piece went off, he gave a start as if he would have leaped into
the river.

When we saw the creature killed, I had a great mind to have the skin of
her, and made signs to the prince that he should send some of his men
over to take the skin off. As soon as he spoke but a word, four of them,
that offered themselves, were untied, and immediately they jumped into
the river, and swam over, and went to work with him. The prince having a
knife that we gave him, made four wooden knives so clever, that I never
saw anything like them in my life; and in less than an hour's time they
brought me the skin of the leopard, which was a monstrous great one, for
it was from the ears to the tale about seven foot, and near five foot
broad on the back, and most admirably spotted all over. The skin of this
leopard I brought to London many years after.

We were now all upon a level as to our travelling, being unshipped, for
our bark would swim no farther, and she was too heavy to carry on our
backs; but as we found the course of the river went a great way farther,
we consulted our carpenters whether we could not pull the bark in
pieces, and make us three or four small boats to go on with. They told
us we might do so, but it would be very long a-doing; and that, when
we had done, we had neither pitch or tar to make them sound to keep the
water out, or nails to fasten the plank. But one of them told us that as
soon as he could come at any large tree near the river, he would make
us a canoe or two in a quarter of the time, and which would serve us
as well for all the uses we could have any occasion for as a boat; and
such, that if we came to any waterfalls, we might take them up, and
carry them for a mile or two by land upon our shoulders.

Upon this we gave over the thoughts of our frigate, and hauling her into
a little cove or inlet, where a small brook came into the main river,
we laid her up for those that came next, and marched forward. We spent
indeed two days dividing our baggage, and loading our tame buffaloes
and our negroes. Our powder and shot, which was the thing we were most
careful of, we ordered thus:--First, the powder we divided into little
leather bags, that is to say, bags of dried skins, with the hair inward,
that the powder might not grow damp; and then we put those bags into
other bags, made of bullocks' skins, very thick and hard, with the hair
outward, that no wet might come in; and this succeeded so well, that in
the greatest rains we had, whereof some were very violent and very long,
we always kept our powder dry. Besides these bags, which held our chief
magazine, we divided to every one a quarter of a pound of powder, and
half a pound of shot, to carry always about us; which, as it was enough
for our present use, so we were willing to have no weight to carry more
than was absolutely necessary, because of the heat.

We kept still on the bank of the river, and for that reason had but very
little communication with the people of the country; for, having also
our bark stored with plenty of provisions, we had no occasion to look
abroad for a supply; but now, when we came to march on foot, we were
obliged often to seek out for food. The first place we came to on the
river, that gave us any stop, was a little negro town, containing about
fifty huts, and there appeared about 400 people, for they all came out
to see us, and wonder at us. When our negroes appeared the inhabitants
began to fly to arms, thinking there had been enemies coming upon them;
but our negroes, though they could not speak their language, made signs
to them that they had no weapons, and were tied two and two together as
captives, and that there were people behind who came from the sun, and
that could kill them all, and make them alive again, if they pleased;
but that they would do them no hurt, and came with peace. As soon as
they understood this they laid down their lances, and bows and arrows,
and came and stuck twelve large stakes in the ground as a token of
peace, bowing themselves to us in token of submission. But as soon as
they saw white men with beards, that is to say, with mustachios, they
ran screaming away, as in a fright.

We kept at a distance from them, not to be too familiar; and when we did
appear it was but two or three of us at a time. But our prisoners
made them understand that we required some provisions of them; so
they brought us some black cattle, for they have abundance of cows and
buffaloes all over that side of the country, as also great numbers of
deer. Our cutler, who had now a great stock of things of his handiwork,
gave them some little knick-knacks, as plates of silver and of iron,
cut diamond fashion, and cut into hearts and into rings, and they were
mightily pleased. They also brought several fruits and roots, which we
did not understand, but our negroes fed heartily on them, and after we
had seen them eat them, we did so too.

Having stocked ourselves here with flesh and root as much as we could
well carry, we divided the burthens among our negroes, appointing about
thirty to forty pounds weight to a man, which we thought indeed was load
enough in a hot country; and the negroes did not at all repine at it,
but would sometimes help one another when they began to be weary, which
did happen now and then, though not often; besides, as most of their
luggage was our provision, it lightened every day, like Aesop's basket
of bread, till we came to get a recruit.--Note, when we loaded them we
untied their hands, and tied them two and two together by one foot.

The third day of our march from this place our chief carpenter desired
us to halt, and set up some huts, for he had found out some trees that
he liked, and resolved to make us some canoes; for, as he told me, he
knew we should have marching enough on foot after we left the river, and
he was resolved to go no farther by land than needs must.

We had no sooner given orders for our little camp, and given leave to
our negroes to lay down their loads, but they fell to work to build our
huts; and though they were tied as above, yet they did it so nimbly as
surprised us. Here we set some of the negroes quite at liberty, that is
to say, without tying them, having the prince's word passed for their
fidelity; and some of these were ordered to help the carpenters, which
they did very handily, with a little direction, and others were sent
to see whether they could get any provisions near hand; but instead of
provisions, three of them came in with two bows and arrows, and five
lances. They could not easily make us understand how they came by them,
only that they had surprised some negro women, who were in some huts,
the men being from home, and they had found the lances and bows in the
huts, or houses, the women and children flying away at the sight of
them, as from robbers. We seemed very angry at them, and made the prince
ask them if they had not killed any of the women or children, making
them believe that, if they had killed anybody, we would make them kill
themselves too; but they protested their innocence, so we excused them.
Then they brought us the bows and arrows and lances; but, at a motion of
their black prince, we gave them back the bows and arrows, and gave them
leave to go out to see what they could kill for food; and here we gave
them the laws of arms, viz., that if any man appeared to assault them,
or shoot at them to offer any violence to them, they might kill them;
but that they should not offer to kill or hurt any that offered them
peace, or laid down their weapons, nor any women or children, upon any
occasion whatsoever. These were our articles of war.

These two fellows had not been gone out above three or four hours, but
one of them came running to us without his bow and arrows, hallooing and
whooping a great while before he came at us, "Okoamo, okoamo!" which,
it seems, was, "Help, help!" The rest of the negroes rose up in a hurry,
and by twos, as they could, ran forward towards their fellows, to know
what the matter was. As for me, I did not understand it, nor any of our
people; the prince looked as if something unlucky had fallen out, and
some of our men took up their arms to be ready on occasion. But the
negroes soon discovered the thing, for we saw four of them presently
after coming along with a great load of meat upon their backs. The case
was, that the two who went out with their bows and arrows, meeting with
a great herd of deer in the plain, had been so nimble as to shoot three
of them, and then one of them came running to us for help to fetch them
away. This was the first venison we had met with in all our march, and
we feasted upon it very plentifully; and this was the first time we
began to prevail with our prince to eat his meat dressed our way; after
which his men were prevailed with by his example, but before that, they
ate most of the flesh they had quite raw.

We wished now we had brought some bows and arrows out with us, which we
might have done; and we began to have so much confidence in our negroes,
and to be so familiar with them, that we oftentimes let them go, or the
greatest part of them, untied, being well assured they would not leave
us, and that they did not know what course to take without us; but one
thing we resolved not to trust them with, and that was the charging our
guns: but they always believed our guns had some heavenly power in them,
that would send forth fire and smoke, and speak with a dreadful noise,
and kill at a distance whenever we bid them.

In about eight days we finished three canoes, and in them we embarked
our white men and our baggage, with our prince, and some of the
prisoners. We also found it needful to keep some of ourselves always on
shore, not only to manage the negroes, but to defend them from enemies
and wild beasts. Abundance of little incidents happened upon this march,
which it is impossible to crowd into this account; particularly, we
saw more wild beasts now than we did before, some elephants, and two or
three lions, none of which kinds we had seen any of before; and we
found our negroes were more afraid of them a great deal than we were;
principally, because they had no bows and arrows, or lances, which were
the particular weapons they were bred up to the exercise of.

But we cured them of their fears by being always ready with our
firearms. However, as we were willing to be sparing of our powder, and
the killing of any of the creatures now was no advantage to us, seeing
their skins were too heavy for us to carry, and their flesh not good to
eat, we resolved therefore to keep some of our pieces uncharged and only
primed; and causing them to flash in the pan, the beasts, even the
lions themselves, would always start and fly back when they saw it, and
immediately march off.

We passed abundance of inhabitants upon this upper part of the river,
and with this observation, that almost every ten miles we came to a
separate nation, and every separate nation had a different speech,
or else their speech had differing dialects, so that they did not
understand one another. They all abounded in cattle, especially on the
river-side; and the eighth day of this second navigation we met with
a little negro town, where they had growing a sort of corn like rice,
which ate very sweet; and, as we got some of it of the people, we made
very good cakes of bread of it, and, making a fire, baked them on the
ground, after the fire was swept away, very well; so that hitherto we
had no want of provisions of any kind that we could desire.

Our negroes towing our canoes, we travelled at a considerable rate, and
by our own account could not go less than twenty or twenty-five English
miles a day, and the river continuing to be much of the same breadth
and very deep all the way, till on the tenth day we came to another
cataract; for a ridge of high hills crossing the whole channel of the
river, the water came tumbling down the rocks from one stage to another
in a strange manner, so that it was a continued link of cataracts from
one to another, in the manner of a cascade, only that the falls were
sometimes a quarter of a mile from one another, and the noise confused
and frightful.

We thought our voyaging was at a full stop now; but three of us, with
a couple of our negroes, mounting the hills another way, to view the
course of the river, we found a fair channel again after about half a
mile's march, and that it was like to hold us a good way further. So
we set all hands to work, unloaded our cargo, and hauled our canoes on
shore, to see if we could carry them.

Upon examination we found that they were very heavy; but our carpenters,
spending but one day's work upon them, hewed away so much of the timber
from their outsides as reduced them very much, and yet they were as fit
to swim as before. When this was done, ten men with poles took up one
of the canoes and made nothing to carry it. So we ordered twenty men to
each canoe, that one ten might relieve the other; and thus we carried
all our canoes, and launched them into the water again, and then fetched
our luggage and loaded it all again into the canoes, and all in an
afternoon; and the next morning early we moved forward again. When we
had towed about four days more, our gunner, who was our pilot, began to
observe that we did not keep our right course so exactly as we ought,
the river winding away a little towards the north, and gave us notice
of it accordingly. However, we were not willing to lose to our desire, a very good harbour, where we rode
in seven fathom water, well defended from the weather, whatever might
happen; and here we got fresh provisions, such as good hogs and some
cows; and that we might lay in a little store, we killed sixteen cows,
and pickled and barrelled up the flesh as well as we could be supposed
to do in the latitude of eight degrees from the line.

We did all this in about five days, and filled our casks with water; and
the last boat was coming off with herbs and roots, we being unmoored,
and our fore-topsail loose for sailing, when we spied a large ship to
the northward, bearing down directly upon us. We knew not what she might
be, but concluded the worst, and made all possible haste to get our
anchor up, and get under sail, that we might be in a readiness to see
what she had to say to us, for we were under no great concern for one
ship, but our notion was, that we should be attacked by three or four
together.

By the time we had got up our anchor and the boat was stowed, the ship
was within a league of us, and, as we thought, bore down to engage us;
so we spread our black flag, or ancient, on the poop, and the bloody
flag at the top-mast-head, and having made a clear ship, we stretched
away to the westward, to get the wind of him.

They had, it seems, quite mistaken us before, expecting nothing of an
enemy or a pirate in those seas; and, not doubting but we had been one
of their own ships, they seemed to be in some confusion when they found
their mistake, so they immediately hauled upon a wind on the other tack,
and stood edging in for the shore, towards the easternmost part of the
island. Upon this we tacked, and stood after him with all the sail we
could, and in two hours came almost within gunshot. Though they crowded
all the sail they could lay on, there was no remedy but to engage us,
and they soon saw their inequality of force. We fired a gun for them to
bring to; so they manned out their boat, and sent to us with a flag of
truce. We sent back the boat, but with this answer to the captain, that
he had nothing to do but to strike and bring his ship to an anchor
under our stern, and come on board us himself, when he should know our
demands; but that, however, since he had not yet put us to the trouble
of forcing him, which we saw we were able to do, we assured them that
the captain should return again in safety, and all his men, and that,
supplying us with such things as we should demand, his ship should not
be plundered. They went back with this message, and it was some time
after they were on board before they struck, which made us begin to
think they refused it; so we fired a shot, and in a few minutes more we
perceived their boat put off; and as soon as the boat put off the ship
struck and came to an anchor, as was directed.

When the captain came on board, we demanded an account of their cargo,
which was chiefly bales of goods from Bengal for Bantam. We told them
our present want was provisions, which they had no need of, being just
at the end of their voyage; and that, if they would send their boat on
shore with ours, and procure us six-and-twenty head of black cattle,
threescore hogs, a quantity of brandy and arrack, and three hundred
bushels of rice, we would let them go free.

As to the rice, they gave us six hundred bushels, which they had
actually on board, together with a parcel shipped upon freight. Also,
they gave us thirty middling casks of very good arrack, but beef and
pork they had none. However, they went on shore with our men, and bought
eleven bullocks and fifty hogs, which were pickled up for our occasion;
and upon the supplies of provision from shore, we dismissed them and
their ship.

We lay here several days before we could furnish ourselves with the
provisions agreed for, and some of the men fancied the Dutchmen were
contriving our destruction; but they were very honest, and did what they
could to furnish the black cattle, but found it impossible to supply so
many. So they came and told us ingenuously, that, unless we could stay
a while longer, they could get no more oxen or cows than those eleven,
with which we were obliged to be satisfied, taking the value of them
in other things, rather than stay longer there. On our side, we were
punctual with them in observing the conditions we had agreed on; nor
would we let any of our men so much as go on board them, or suffer any
of their men to come on board us; for, had any of our men gone on board,
nobody could have answered for their behaviour, any more than if they
had been on shore in an enemy's country.

We were now victualled for our voyage; and, as we mattered not purchase,
we went merrily on for the coast of Ceylon, where we intended to touch,
to get fresh water again, and more provisions; and we had nothing
material offered in this part of the voyage, only that we met with
contrary winds, and were above a month in the passage.

We put in upon the south coast of the island, desiring to have as little
to do with the Dutch as we could; and as the Dutch were lords of the
country as to commerce, so they are more so of the sea-coast, where they
have several forts, and, in particular, have all the cinnamon, which is
the trade of that island.

We took in fresh water here, and some provisions, but did not much
trouble ourselves about laying in any stores, our beef and hogs, which
we got at Java, being not yet all gone by a good deal. We had a little
skirmish on shore here with some of the people of the island, some of
our men having been a little too familiar with the homely ladies of the
country; for homely, indeed, they were, to such a degree, that if our
men had not had good stomachs that way, they would scarce have touched
any of them.

I could never fully get it out of our men what they did, they were so
true to one another in their wickedness, but I understood in the main,
that it was some barbarous thing they had done, and that they had like
to have paid dear for it, for the men resented it to the last degree,
and gathered in such numbers about them, that, had not sixteen more of
our men, in another boat, come all in the nick of time, just to rescue
our first men, who were but eleven, and so fetch them off by main force,
they had been all cut off, the inhabitants being no less than two or
three hundred, armed with darts and lances, the usual weapons of the
country, and which they are very dexterous at the throwing, even so
dexterous that it was scarce credible; and had our men stood to fight
them, as some of them were bold enough to talk of, they had been all
overwhelmed and killed. As it was, seventeen of our men were wounded,
and some of them very dangerously. But they were more frighted than hurt
too, for every one of them gave themselves over for dead men, believing
the lances were poisoned. But William was our comfort here too; for,
when two of our surgeons were of the same opinion, and told the men
foolishly enough that they would die, William cheerfully went to work
with them, and cured them all but one, who rather died by drinking some
arrack punch than of his wound; the excess of drinking throwing him into
a fever.

We had enough of Ceylon, though some of our people were for going
ashore again, sixty or seventy men together, to be revenged; but William
persuaded them against it; and his reputation was so great among the
men, as well as with us that were commanders, that he could influence
them more than any of us.

They were mighty warm upon their revenge, and they would go on shore,
and destroy five hundred of them. "Well," says William, "and suppose you
do, what are you the better?" "Why, then," says one of them, speaking
for the rest, "we shall have our satisfaction." "Well, and what will you
be the better for that?" says William. They could then say nothing to
that. "Then," says William, "if I mistake not, your business is money;
now, I desire to know, if you conquer and kill two or three thousand of
these poor creatures, they have no money, pray what will you get? They
are poor naked wretches; what shall you gain by them? But then," says
William, "perhaps, in doing this, you may chance to lose half-a-score of
your own company, as it is very probable you may. Pray, what gain is
in it? and what account can you give the captain for his lost men?" In
short, William argued so effectually, that he convinced them that it
was mere murder to do so; and that the men had a right to their own,
and that they had no right to take them away; that it was destroying
innocent men, who had acted no otherwise than as the laws of nature
dictated; and that it would be as much murder to do so, as to meet a man
on the highway, and kill him, for the mere sake of it, in cold blood,
not regarding whether he had done any wrong to us or no.

These reasons prevailed with them at last, and they were content to
go away, and leave them as they found them. In the first skirmish they
killed between sixty and seventy men, and wounded a great many more; but
they had nothing, and our people got nothing by it, but the loss of one
man's life, and the wounding sixteen more, as above.

But another accident brought us to a necessity of further business with
these people, and indeed we had like to have put an end to our lives
and adventures all at once among them; for, about three days after our
putting out to sea from the place where we had that skirmish, we
were attacked by a violent storm of wind from the south, or rather a
hurricane of wind from all the points southward, for it blew in a most
desperate and furious manner from the S.E. to the S.W., one minute at
one point, and then instantly turning about again to another point,
but with the same violence; nor were we able to work the ship in that
condition, so that the ship I was in split three top-sails, and at last
brought the main-top-mast by the board; and, in a word, we were once or
twice driven right ashore; and one time, had not the wind shifted the
very moment it did, we had been dashed in a thousand pieces upon a great
ledge of rocks which lay off about half-a-league from the shore; but,
as I have said, the wind shifting very often, and at that time coming
to the E.S.E., we stretched off, and got above a league more sea-room in
half-an-hour. After that, it blew with some fury S.W. by S., then S.W.
by W., and put us back again a great way to the eastward of the ledge
of rocks, where we found a great opening between the rocks and the land,
and endeavoured to come to an anchor there, but we found there was no
ground fit to anchor in, and that we should lose our anchors, there
being nothing but rocks. We stood through the opening, which held about
four leagues. The storm continued, and now we found a dreadful foul
shore, and knew not what course to take. We looked out very narrowly
for some river or creek or bay, where we might run in, and come to an
anchor, but found none a great while. At length we saw a great headland
lie out far south into the sea, and that to such a length, that, in
short, we saw plainly that, if the wind held where it was, we could not
weather it, so we ran in as much under the lee of the point as we could,
and came to an anchor in about twelve fathom water.

But the wind veering again in the night, and blowing exceedingly hard,
our anchors came home, and the ship drove till the rudder struck against
the ground; and had the ship gone half her length farther she had been
lost, and every one of us with her. But our sheet-anchor held its own,
and we heaved in some of the cable, to get clear of the ground we had
struck upon. It was by this only cable that we rode it out all night;
and towards morning we thought the wind abated a little; and it was well
for us that it was so, for, in spite of what our sheet-anchor did for
us, we found the ship fast aground in the morning, to our very great
surprise and amazement.

When the tide was out, though the water here ebbed away, the ship lay
almost dry upon a bank of hard sand, which never, I suppose, had any
ship upon it before. The people of the country came down in great
numbers to look at us and gaze, not knowing what we were, but gaping at
us as at a great sight or wonder at which they were surprised, and knew
not what to do.

I have reason to believe that upon the sight they immediately sent an
account of a ship being there, and of the condition we were in, for the
next day there appeared a great man; whether it was their king or no
I know not, but he had abundance of men with him, and some with long
javelins in their hands as long as half-pikes; and these came all down
to the water's edge, and drew up in a very good order, just in our view.
They stood near an hour without making any motion; and then there came
near twenty of them, with a man before them carrying a white flag. They
came forward into the water as high as their waists, the sea not going
so high as before, for the wind was abated, and blew off the shore.

The man made a long oration to us, as we could see by his gestures; and
we sometimes heard his voice, but knew not one word he said. William,
who was always useful to us, I believe was here again the saving of all
our lives. The case was this: The fellow, or what I might call him, when
his speech was done, gave three great screams (for I know not what else
to say they were), then lowered his white flag three times, and then
made three motions to us with his arm to come to him.

I acknowledge that I was for manning out the boat and going to them, but
William would by no means allow me. He told me we ought to trust nobody;
that, if they were barbarians, and under their own government, we might
be sure to be all murdered; and, if they were Christians, we should not
fare much better, if they knew who we were; that it was the custom of
the Malabars to betray all people that they could get into their hands,
and that these were some of the same people; and that, if we had any
regard to our own safety, we should not go to them by any means. I
opposed him a great while, and told him I thought he used to be always
right, but that now I thought he was not; that I was no more for running
needless risks than he or any one else; but I thought all nations in the
world, even the most savage people, when they held out a flag of peace,
kept the offer of peace made by that signal very sacredly; and I gave
him several examples of it in the history of my African travels, which
I have here gone through in the beginning of this work, and that I could
not think these people worse than some of them. And, besides, I told him
our case seemed to be such that we must fall into somebody's hands or
other, and that we had better fall into their hands by a friendly treaty
than by a forced submission, nay, though they had indeed a treacherous
design; and therefore I was for a parley with them.

"Well, friend," says William very gravely, "if thou wilt go I cannot
help it; I shall only desire to take my last leave of thee at parting,
for, depend upon it, thou wilt never see us again. Whether we in the
ship may come off any better at last I cannot resolve thee; but this I
will answer for, that we will not give up our lives idly, and in cool
blood, as thou art going to do; we will at least preserve ourselves as
long as we can, and die at last like men, not like fools, trepanned by
the wiles of a few barbarians."

William spoke this with so much warmth, and yet with so much assurance
of our fate, that I began to think a little of the risk I was going to
run. I had no more mind to be murdered than he; and yet I could not for
my life be so faint-hearted in the thing as he. Upon which I asked him
if he had any knowledge of the place, or had ever been there. He said,
No. Then I asked him if he had heard or read anything about the people
of this island, and of their way of treating any Christians that had
fallen into their hands; and he told me he had heard of one, and
he would tell me the story afterward. His name, he said, was Knox,
commander of an East India ship, who was driven on shore, just as we
were, upon this island of Ceylon, though he could not say it was at the
same place, or whereabouts; that he was beguiled by the barbarians, and
enticed to come on shore, just as we were invited to do at that time;
and that, when they had him, they surrounded him, and eighteen or twenty
of his men, and never suffered them to return, but kept them prisoners,
or murdered them, he could not tell which; but they were carried away
up into the country, separated from one another, and never heard of
afterwards, except the captain's son, who miraculously made his escape,
after twenty years' slavery.

I had no time then to ask him to give the full story of this Knox, much
less to hear him tell it me; but, as it is usual in such cases, when
one begins to be a little touched, I turned short with him. "Why then,
friend William," said I, "what would you have us do? You see what
condition we are in, and what is before us; something must be done, and
that immediately." "Why," says William, "I'll tell thee what thou shalt
do; first, cause a white flag to be hanged out, as they do to us, and
man out the longboat and pinnace with as many men as they can well stow,
to handle their arms, and let me go with them, and thou shalt see what
we will do. If I miscarry, thou mayest be safe; and I will also tell
thee, that if I do miscarry, it shall be my own fault, and thou shalt
learn wit by my folly."

I knew not what to reply to him at first; but, after some pause, I said,
"William, William, I am as both you should be lost as you are that I
should; and if there be any danger, I desire you may no more fall into
it than I. Therefore, if you will, let us all keep in the ship, fare
alike, and take our fate together."

"No, no," says William, "there's no danger in the method I propose; thou
shalt go with me, if thou thinkest fit. If thou pleasest but to follow
the measures that I shall resolve on, depend upon it, though we will
go off from the ships, we will not a man of us go any nearer them than
within call to talk with them. Thou seest they have no boats to come off
to us; but," says he, "I rather desire thou wouldst take my advice, and
manage the ships as I shall give the signal from the boat, and let us
concert that matter together before we go off."

Well, I found William had his measures in his head all laid beforehand,
and was not at a loss what to do at all; so I told him he should be
captain for this voyage, and we would be all of us under his orders,
which I would see observed to a tittle.

Upon this conclusion of our debates, he ordered four-and-twenty men into
the long-boat, and twelve men into the pinnace, and the sea being now
pretty smooth, they went off, being all very well armed. Also he ordered
that all the guns of the great ship, on the side which lay next the
shore, should be loaded with musket-balls, old nails, stubs, and
such-like pieces of old iron, lead, and anything that came to hand; and
that we should prepare to fire as soon as ever we saw them lower the
white flag and hoist up a red one in the pinnace.

With these measures fixed between us, they went off towards the shore,
William in the pinnace with twelve men, and the long-boat coming after
him with four-and-twenty more, all stout resolute fellows, and very
well armed. They rowed so near the shore as that they might speak to one
another, carrying a white flag, as the other did, and offering a parley.
The brutes, for such they were, showed themselves very courteous; but
finding we could not understand them, they fetched an old Dutchman, who
had been their prisoner many years, and set him to speak to us. The sum
and substance of his speech was, that the king of the country had sent
his general down to know who we were, and what our business was. William
stood up in the stern of the pinnace, and told him, that as to that, he,
that was an European, by his language and voice, might easily know what
we were, and our condition; the ship being aground upon the sand would
also tell him that our business there was that of a ship in distress; so
William desired to know what they came down for with such a multitude,
and with arms and weapons, as if they came to war with us.

He answered, they might have good reason to come down to the shore, the
country being alarmed with the appearance of ships of strangers upon
the coast; and as our vessels were full of men, and as we had guns and
weapons, the king had sent part of his military men, that, in case of
any invasion upon the country, they might be ready to defend themselves,
whatsoever might be the occasion.

"But," says he, "as you are men in distress, the king has ordered his
general, who is here also, to give you all the assistance he can, and to
invite you on shore, and receive you with all possible courtesy." Says
William, very quick upon him, "Before I give thee an answer to that,
I desire thee to tell me what thou art, for by thy speech thou art an
European." He answered presently, he was a Dutchman. "That I know well,"
says William, "by thy speech; but art thou a native Dutchman of Holland,
or a native of this country, that has learned Dutch by conversing among
the Hollanders, who we know are settled upon this island?"

"No," says the old man, "I am a native of Delft, in the province of
Holland, in Europe."

"Well," says William, immediately, "but art thou a Christian or a
heathen, or what we call a renegado?"

"I am," says he, "a Christian." And so they went on, in a short
dialogue, as follows:--

_William_. Thou art a Dutchman, and a Christian, thou sayest; pray, art
thou a freeman or a servant?

_Dutchman_. I am a servant to the king here, and in his army.

_W_. But art thou a volunteer, or a prisoner?

_D_. Indeed I was a prisoner at first, but am at liberty now, and so am
a volunteer.

_W_. That is to say, being first a prisoner, thou hast liberty to serve
them; but art thou so at liberty that thou mayest go away, if thou
pleasest, to thine own countrymen?

_D_. No, I do not say so; my countrymen live a great way off, on the
north and east parts of the island, and there is no going to them
without the king's express license.

_W_. Well, and why dost thou not get a license to go away?

_D_. I have never asked for it.

_W_. And, I suppose, if thou didst, thou knowest thou couldst not obtain
it.

_D_. I cannot say much as to that; but why do you ask me all these
questions?

_W_. Why, my reason is good; if thou art a Christian and a prisoner,
how canst thou consent to be made an instrument to these barbarians,
to betray us into their hands, who are thy countrymen and
fellow-Christians? Is it not a barbarous thing in thee to do so?

_D_. How do I go about to betray you? Do I not give you an account how
the king invites you to come on shore, and has ordered you to be treated
courteously and assisted?

_W_. As thou art a Christian, though I doubt it much, dost thou believe
the king or the general, as thou callest it, means one word of what he
says?

_D_. He promises you by the mouth of his great general.

_W_. I don't ask thee what he promises, or by whom; but I ask thee this:
Canst thou say that thou believest he intends to perform it?

_D_. How can I answer that? How can I tell what he intends?

_W_. Thou canst tell what thou believest.

_D_. I cannot say but he will perform it; I believe he may.

_W_. Thou art but a double-tongued Christian, I doubt. Come, I'll ask
thee another question: Wilt thou say that thou believest it, and that
thou wouldst advise me to believe it, and put our lives into their hands
upon these promises?

_D_. I am not to be your adviser.

_W_. Thou art perhaps afraid to speak thy mind, because thou art in
their power. Pray, do any of them understand what thou and I say? Can
they speak Dutch?

_D_. No, not one of them; I have no apprehensions upon that account at
all.

_W_. Why, then, answer me plainly, if thou art a Christian: Is it safe
for us to venture upon their words, to put ourselves into their hands,
and come on shore?

_D_. You put it very home to me. Pray let me ask you another question:
Are you in any likelihood of getting your ship off, if you refuse it?

_W_. Yes, yes, we shall get off the ship; now the storm is over we don't
fear it.

_D_. Then I cannot say it is best for you to trust them.

_W_. Well, it is honestly said.

_D_. But what shall I say to them?

_W_. Give them good words, as they give us.

_D_. What good words?

_W_. Why, let them tell the king that we are strangers, who were driven
on his coast by a great storm; that we thank him very kindly for his
offer of civility to us, which, if we are further distressed, we will
accept thankfully; but that at present we have no occasion to come on
shore; and besides, that we cannot safely leave the ship in the present
condition she is in; but that we are obliged to take care of her, in
order to get her off; and expect, in a tide or two more, to get her
quite clear, and at an anchor.

_D_. But he will expect you to come on shore, then, to visit him, and
make him some present for his civility.

_W_. When we have got our ship clear, and stopped the leaks, we will pay
our respects to him.

_D_. Nay, you may as well come to him now as then.

_W_. Nay, hold, friend; I did not say we would come to him then: you
talked of making him a present, that is to pay our respects to him, is
it not?

_D_. Well, but I will tell him that you will come on shore to him when
your ship is got off.

_W_. I have nothing to say to that; you may tell him what you think fit.

_D_. But he will be in a great rage if I do not.

_W_. Who will he be in a great rage at?

_D_. At you.

_W_. What occasion have we to value that?

_D_. Why, he will send all his army down against you.

_W_. And what if they were all here just now? What dost thou suppose
they could do to us?

_D_. He would expect they should burn your ships and bring you all to
him.

_W_. Tell him, if he should try, he may catch a Tartar.

_D_. He has a world of men.

_W_. Has he any ships?

_D_. No, he has no ships.

_W_. Nor boats?

_D_. No, nor boats.

_W_. Why, what then do you think we care for his men? What canst thou do
now to us, if thou hadst a hundred thousand with thee?

_D_. Oh! they might set you on fire.

_W_. Set us a-firing, thou meanest; that they might indeed; but set us
on fire they shall not; they may try, at their peril, and we shall make
mad work with your hundred thousand men, if they come within reach of
our guns, I assure thee.

_D_. But what if the king gives you hostages for your safety?

_W_. Whom can he give but mere slaves and servants like thyself, whose
lives he no more values than we an English hound?

_D_. Whom do you demand for hostages?

_W_. Himself and your worship.

_D_. What would you do with him?

_W_. Do with him as he would do with us--cut his head off.

_D_. And what would you do with me?

_W_. Do with thee? We would carry thee home into thine own country; and,
though thou deservest the gallows, we would make a man and a Christian
of thee again, and not do by thee as thou wouldst have done by
us--betray thee to a parcel of merciless, savage pagans, that know no
God, nor how to show mercy to man.

_D_. You put a thought in my head that I will speak to you about
to-morrow.

Thus they went away, and William came on board, and gave us a full
account of his parley with the old Dutchman, which was very diverting,
and to me instructing; for I had abundance of reason to acknowledge
William had made a better judgment of things than I.

It was our good fortune to get our ship off that very night, and to
bring her to an anchor at about a mile and a half farther out, and in
deep water, to our great satisfaction; so that we had no need to fear
the Dutchman's king, with his hundred thousand men; and indeed we
had some sport with them the next day, when they came down, a
vast prodigious multitude of them, very few less in number, in our
imagination, than a hundred thousand, with some elephants; though, if it
had been an army of elephants, they could have done us no harm; for we
were fairly at our anchor now, and out of their reach. And indeed we
thought ourselves more out of their reach than we really were; and it
was ten thousand to one that we had not been fast aground again, for the
wind blowing off shore, though it made the water smooth where we lay,
yet it blew the ebb farther out than usual, and we could easily perceive
the sand, which we touched upon before, lay in the shape of a half-moon,
and surrounded us with two horns of it, so that we lay in the middle
or centre of it, as in a round bay, safe just as we were, and in deep
water, but present death, as it were, on the right hand and on the left,
for the two horns or points of the sand reached out beyond where our
ship lay near two miles.

On that part of the sand which lay on our east side, this misguided
multitude extended themselves; and being, most of them, not above their
knees, or most of them not above ankle-deep in the water, they as it
were surrounded us on that side, and on the side of the mainland, and a
little way on the other side of the sand, standing in a half-circle,
or rather three-fifths of a circle, for about six miles in length. The
other horn, or point of the sand, which lay on our west side, being not
quite so shallow, they could not extend themselves upon it so far.

They little thought what service they had done us, and how unwittingly,
and by the greatest ignorance, they had made themselves pilots to us,
while we, having not sounded the place, might have been lost before we
were aware. It is true we might have sounded our new harbour before we
had ventured out, but I cannot say for certain whether we should or not;
for I, for my part, had not the least suspicion of what our real case
was; however, I say, perhaps, before we had weighed, we should have
looked about us a little. I am sure we ought to have done it; for,
besides these armies of human furies, we had a very leaky ship, and
all our pumps could hardly keep the water from growing upon us, and our
carpenters were overboard, working to find out and stop the wounds we
had received, heeling her first on the one side, and then on the other;
and it was very diverting to see how, when our men heeled the ship over
to the side next the wild army that stood on the east horn of the sand,
they were so amazed, between fright and joy, that it put them into a
kind of confusion, calling to one another, hallooing and skreeking, in a
manner that it is impossible to describe.

While we were doing this, for we were in a great hurry you may be sure,
and all hands at work, as well at the stopping our leaks as repairing
our rigging and sails, which had received a great deal of damage, and
also in rigging a new main-top-mast and the like;--I say, while we were
doing all this, we perceived a body of men, of near a thousand, move
from that part of the army of the barbarians that lay at the bottom of
the sandy bay, and came all along the water's edge, round the sand, till
they stood just on our broadside east, and were within about half-a-mile
of us. Then we saw the Dutchman come forward nearer to us, and all
alone, with his white flag and all his motions, just as before, and
there he stood.

Our men had but just brought the ship to rights again as they came up to
our broadside, and we had very happily found out and stopped the worst
and most dangerous leak that we had, to our very great satisfaction;
so I ordered the boats to be hauled up and manned as they were the day
before, and William to go as plenipotentiary. I would have gone myself
if I had understood Dutch, but as I did not, it was to no purpose, for
I should be able to know nothing of what was said but from him
at second-hand, which might be done as well afterwards. All the
instructions I pretended to give William was, if possible, to get the
old Dutchman away, and, if he could, to make him come on board.

Well, William went just as before, and when he came within about sixty
or seventy yards of the shore, he held up his white flag as the Dutchman
did, and turning the boat's broadside to the shore, and his men lying
upon their oars, the parley or dialogue began again thus:--

_William_. Well, friend, what dost thou say to us now?

_Dutchman_. I come of the same mild errand as I did yesterday.

_W_. What! dost thou pretend to come of a mild errand with all these
people at thy back, and all the foolish weapons of war they bring with
them? Prithee, what dost thou mean?

_D_. The king hastens us to invite the captain and all his men to come
on shore, and has ordered all his men to show them all the civility they
can.

_W_. Well, and are all those men come to invite us ashore?

D. They will do you no hurt, if you will come on shore peaceably.

W. Well, and what dost thou think they can do to us, if we will not?

D. I would not have them do you any hurt then, neither.

W. But prithee, friend, do not make thyself fool and knave too. Dost not
thou know that we are out of fear of all thy army, and out of danger
of all that they can do? What makes thee act so simply as well as so
knavishly?

D. Why, you may think yourselves safer than you are; you do not know
what they may do to you. I can assure you they are able to do you a
great deal of harm, and perhaps burn your ship.

W. Suppose that were true, as I am sure it is false; you see we have
more ships to carry us off (pointing to the sloop).

[N.B.--Just at this time we discovered the sloop standing towards us
from the east, along the shore, at about the distance of two leagues,
which was to our particular satisfaction, she having been missing
thirteen days.]

D. We do not value that; if you had ten ships, you dare not come on
shore, with all the men you have, in a hostile way; we are too many for
you.

W. Thou dost not, even in that, speak as thou meanest; and we may give
thee a trial of our hands when our friends come up to us, for thou
hearest they have discovered us.

[Just then the sloop fired five guns, which was to get news of us, for
they did not see us.]

D. Yes, I hear they fire; but I hope your ship will not fire again; for,
if they do, our general will take it for breaking the truce, and will
make the army let fly a shower of arrows at you in the boat.

W. Thou mayest be sure the ship will fire that the other ship may hear
them, but not with ball. If thy general knows no better, he may begin
when he will; but thou mayest be sure we will return it to his cost.

D. What must I do, then?

W. Do! Why, go to him, and tell him of it beforehand, then; and let
him know that the ship firing is not at him nor his men; and then come
again, and tell us what he says.

D. No; I will send to him, which will do as well.

W. Do as thou wilt, but I believe thou hadst better go thyself; for if
our men fire first, I suppose he will be in a great wrath, and it may be
at thee; for, as to his wrath at us, we tell thee beforehand we value it
not.

D. You slight them too much; you know not what they may do.

W. Thou makest as if these poor savage wretches could do mighty things:
prithee, let us see what you can all do, we value it not; thou mayest
set down thy flag of truce when thou pleasest, and begin.

D. I had rather make a truce, and have you all part friends.

W. Thou art a deceitful rogue thyself, for it is plain thou knowest
these people would only persuade us on shore to entrap and surprise us;
and yet thou that art a Christian, as thou callest thyself, would have
us come on shore and put our lives into their hands who know nothing
that belongs to compassion, good usage, or good manners. How canst thou
be such a villain?

D. How can you call me so? What have I done to you, and what would you
have me do?

W. Not act like a traitor, but like one that was once a Christian, and
would have been so still, if you had not been a Dutchman.

D. I know not what to do, not I. I wish I were from them; they are a
bloody people.

W. Prithee, make no difficulty of what thou shouldst do. Canst thou
swim?

D. Yes, I can swim; but if I should attempt to swim off to you, I should
have a thousand arrows and javelins sticking in me before I should get
to your boat.

W. I'll bring the boat close to thee, and take thee on board in spite
of them all. We will give them but one volley, and I'll engage they will
all run away from thee.

D. You are mistaken in them, I assure you; they would immediately come
all running down to the shore, and shoot fire-arrows at you, and set
your boat and ship and all on fire about your ears.

W. We will venture that if thou wilt come off.

D. Will you use me honourably when I am among you?

W. I'll give thee my word for it, if thou provest honest.

D. Will you not make me a prisoner?

W. I will be thy surety, body for body, that thou shalt be a free man,
and go whither thou wilt, though I own to thee thou dost not deserve it.

Just at this time our ship fired three guns to answer the sloop and let
her know we saw her, who immediately, we perceived, understood it,
and stood directly for the place. But it is impossible to express the
confusion and filthy vile noise, the hurry and universal disorder, that
was among that vast multitude of people upon our firing off three guns.
They immediately all repaired to their arms, as I may call it; for to
say they put themselves into order would be saying nothing.

Upon the word of command, then, they advanced all in a body to the
seaside, and resolving to give us one volley of their fire-arms (for
such they were), immediately they saluted us with a hundred thousand of
their fire-arrows, every one carrying a little bag of cloth dipped
in brimstone, or some such thing, which, flying through the air, had
nothing to hinder it taking fire as it flew, and it generally did so.

I cannot say but this method of attacking us, by a way we had no notion
of, might give us at first some little surprise, for the number was so
great at first, that we were not altogether without apprehensions that
they might unluckily set our ship on fire, so that William resolved
immediately to row on board, and persuade us all to weigh and stand out
to sea; but there was no time for it, for they immediately let fly a
volley at the boat, and at the ship, from all parts of the vast crowd of
people which stood near the shore. Nor did they fire, as I may call it,
all at once, and so leave off; but their arrows being soon notched upon
their bows, they kept continually shooting, so that the air was full of
flame.

I could not say whether they set their cotton rag on fire before they
shot the arrow, for I did not perceive they had fire with them, which,
however, it seems they had. The arrow, besides the fire it carried with
it, had a head, or a peg, as we call it, of bone; and some of sharp
flint stone; and some few of a metal, too soft in itself for metal, but
hard enough to cause it to enter, if it were a plank, so as to stick
where it fell.

William and his men had notice sufficient to lie close behind their
waste-boards, which, for this very purpose, they had made so high
that they could easily sink themselves behind them, so as to defend
themselves from anything that came point-blank (as we call it) or upon a
line; but for what might fall perpendicularly out of the air they had no
guard, but took the hazard of that. At first they made as if they would
row away, but before they went they gave a volley of their fire-arms,
firing at those which stood with the Dutchman; but William ordered them
to be sure to take their aim at others, so as to miss him, and they did
so.

There was no calling to them now, for the noise was so great among them
that they could hear nobody, but our men boldly rowed in nearer to them,
for they were at first driven a little off, and when they came nearer,
they fired a second volley, which put the fellows into great confusion,
and we could see from the ship that several of them were killed or
wounded.

We thought this was a very unequal fight, and therefore we made a signal
to our men to row away, that we might have a little of the sport as
well as they; but the arrows flew so thick upon them, being so near the
shore, that they could not sit to their oars, so they spread a little
of their sail, thinking they might sail along the shore, and lie behind
their waste-board; but the sail had not been spread six minutes till it
had five hundred fire-arrows shot into it and through it, and at length
set it fairly on fire; nor were our men quite out of the danger of its
setting the boat on fire, and this made them paddle and shove the boat
away as well as they could, as they lay, to get farther off.

By this time they had left us a fair mark at the whole savage army; and
as we had sheered the ship as near to them as we could, we fired among
the thickest of them six or seven times, five guns at a time, with shot,
old iron, musket-bullets, &c.

We could easily see that we made havoc among them, and killed and
wounded abundance of them, and that they were in a great surprise at it;
but yet they never offered to stir, and all this while their fire-arrows
flew as thick as before.

At last, on a sudden their arrows stopped, and the old Dutchman came
running down to the water-side all alone, with his white flag, as
before, waving it as high as he could, and making signals to our boat to
come to him again.

William did not care at first to go near him, but the man continuing to
make signals to him to come, at last William went; and the Dutchman told
him that he had been with the general, who was much mollified by the
slaughter of his men, and that now he could have anything of him.

"Anything!" says William; "what have we to do with him? Let him go about
his business, and carry his men out of gunshot, can't he?"

"Why," says the Dutchman, "but he dares not stir, nor see the king's
face; unless some of your men come on shore, he will certainly put him
to death."

"Why, then," says William, "he is a dead man; for if it were to save his
life, and the lives of all the crowd that is with him, he shall never
have one of us in his power. But I'll tell thee," said William, "how
thou shalt cheat him, and gain thy own liberty too, if thou hast any
mind to see thy own country again, and art not turned savage, and grown
fond of living all thy days among heathens and savages."

"I would be glad to do it with all my heart," says he; "but if I should
offer to swim off to you now, though they are so far from me, they shoot
so true that they would kill me before I got half-way."

"But," says William, "I'll tell thee how thou shalt come with his
consent. Go to him, and tell him I have offered to carry you on board,
to try if you could persuade the captain to come on shore, and that I
would not hinder him if he was willing to venture."

The Dutchman seemed in a rapture at the very first word. "I'll do it,"
says he; "I am persuaded he will give me leave to come."

Away he runs, as if he had a glad message to carry, and tells the
general that William had promised, if he would go on board the ship with
him, he would persuade the captain to return with him. The general was
fool enough to give him orders to go, and charged him not to come back
without the captain; which he readily promised, and very honestly might.

So they took him in, and brought him on board, and he was as good as
his word to them, for he never went back to them any more; and the sloop
being come to the mouth of the inlet where we lay, we weighed and set
sail; but, as we went out, being pretty near the shore, we fired three
guns, as it were among them, but without any shot, for it was of no
use to us to hurt any more of them. After we had fired, we gave them a
cheer, as the seamen call it; that is to say, we hallooed, at them, by
way of triumph, and so carried off their ambassador. How it fared with
their general, we know nothing of that.

This passage, when I related it to a friend of mine, after my return
from those rambles, agreed so well with his relation of what happened to
one Mr Knox, an English captain, who some time ago was decoyed on shore
by these people, that it could not but be very much to my satisfaction
to think what mischief we had all escaped; and I think it cannot but be
very profitable to record the other story (which is but short) with my
own, to show whoever reads this what it was I avoided, and prevent their
falling into the like, if they have to do with the perfidious people of
Ceylon. The relation is as follows:--

The island of Ceylon being inhabited for the greatest part by
barbarians, which will not allow any trade or commerce with any European
nation, and inaccessible by any travellers, it will be convenient to
relate the occasion how the author of this story happened to go into
this island, and what opportunities he had of being fully acquainted
with the people, their laws and customs, that so we may the better
depend upon the account, and value it as it deserves, for the rarity
as well as the truth of it; and both these the author gives us a brief
relation of in this manner. His words are as follows:

In the year 1657, the _Anne_ frigate, of London, Captain Robert Knox,
commander, on the 21st day of January, set sail out of the Downs, in the
service of the honourable East India Company of England, bound for Fort
St George, upon the coast of Coromandel, to trade for one year from port
to port in India; which having performed, as he was lading his goods
to return for England, being in the road of Masulipatam, on the 19th of
November 1659, there happened such a mighty storm, that in it several
ships were cast away, and he was forced to cut his mainmast by the
board, which so disabled the ship, that he could not proceed in his
voyage; whereupon Cottiar, in the island of Ceylon, being a very
commodious bay, fit for her present distress, Thomas Chambers, Esq.,
since Sir Thomas Chambers, the agent at Fort St George, ordered that the
ship should take in some cloth and India merchants belonging to Porto
Novo, who might trade there while she lay to set her mast, and repair
the other damages sustained by the storm. At her first coming thither,
after the Indian merchants were set ashore, the captain and his men were
very jealous of the people of that place, by reason the English never
had any commerce or dealing with them; but after they had been there
twenty days, going ashore and returning again at pleasure, without any
molestation, they began to lay aside all suspicious thoughts of the
people that dwelt thereabouts, who had kindly entertained them for their
money.

By this time the king of the country had notice of their arrival, and,
not being acquainted with their intents, he sent down a dissauva, or
general, with an army, to them, who immediately sent a messenger to
the captain on board, to desire him to come ashore to him, pretending
a letter from the king. The captain saluted the message with firing of
guns, and ordered his son, Robert Knox, and Mr John Loveland, merchant
of the ship, to go ashore, and wait on him. When they were come before
him, he demanded who they were, and how long they should stay. They told
him they were Englishmen, and not to stay above twenty or thirty days,
and desired permission to trade in his Majesty's port. His answer was,
that the king was glad to hear the English were come into his country,
and had commanded him to assist them as they should desire, and had sent
a letter to be delivered to none but the captain himself. They were then
twelve miles from the seaside, and therefore replied, that the captain
could not leave his ship to come so far; but if he pleased to go down
to the seaside, the captain would wait on him to receive the letter;
whereupon the dissauva desired them to stay that day, and on the morrow
he would go with them; which, rather than displease him in so small a
matter, they consented to. In the evening the dissauva sent a present to
the captain of cattle and fruits, &c., which, being carried all night by
the messengers, was delivered to him in the morning, who told him withal
that his men were coming down with the dissauva, and desired his company
on shore against his coming, having a letter from the king to deliver
into his own hand. The captain, mistrusting nothing, came on shore with
his boat, and, sitting under a tamarind tree, waited for the dissauva.
In the meantime the native soldiers privately surrounded him and the
seven men he had with him, and seizing them, carried them to meet the
dissauva, bearing the captain on a hammock on their shoulders.

The next day the long-boat's crew, not knowing what had happened, came
on shore to cut down a tree to make cheeks for the mainmast, and were
made prisoners after the same manner, though with more violence, because
they were more rough with them, and made resistance; yet they were not
brought to the captain and his company, but quartered in another house
in the same town.

The dissauva having thus gotten two boats and eighteen men, his next
care was to gain the ship; and to that end, telling the captain that he
and his men were only detained because the king intended to send letters
and a present to the English nation by him, desired he would send some
men on board his ship to order her to stay; and because the ship was
in danger of being fired by the Dutch if she stayed long in the bay, to
bring her up the river. The captain did not approve of the advice, but
did not dare to own his dislike; so he sent his son with the order, but
with a solemn conjuration to return again, which he accordingly did,
bringing a letter from the company in the ship, that they would not obey
the captain, nor any other, in this matter, but were resolved to stand
on their own defence. This letter satisfied the dissauva, who thereupon
gave the captain leave to write for what he would have brought from
the ship, pretending that he ha﻿
AUTHOR’S PREFACE.


                          TO DALBY THOMAS, ESQ.,

_One of the Commission’s for Managing His majesty’s Duties on Glass_,
_&c._

SIR,

THIS preface comes directed to you, not as commissioner, &c., under whom
I have the honour to serve his Majesty, nor as a friend, though I have
great obligations of that sort also, but as the most proper judge of the
subjects treated of, and more capable than the greatest part of mankind
to distinguish and understand them.

Books are useful only to such whose genius are suitable to the subject of
them; and to dedicate a book of projects to a person who had never
concerned himself to think that way would be like music to one that has
no ear.

And yet your having a capacity to judge of these things no way brings you
under the despicable title of a projector, any more than knowing the
practices and subtleties of wicked men makes a man guilty of their
crimes.

The several chapters of this book are the results of particular thoughts
occasioned by conversing with the public affairs during the present war
with France.  The losses and casualties which attend all trading nations
in the world, when involved in so cruel a war as this, have reached us
all, and I am none of the least sufferers; if this has put me, as well as
others, on inventions and projects, so much the subject of this book, it
is no more than a proof of the reason I give for the general projecting
humour of the nation.

One unhappiness I lie under in the following book, viz.: That having kept
the greatest part of it by me for near five years, several of the
thoughts seem to be hit by other hands, and some by the public, which
turns the tables upon me, as if I had borrowed from them.

As particularly that of the seamen, which you know well I had contrived
long before the Act for registering seamen was proposed.  And that of
educating women, which I think myself bound to declare, was formed long
before the book called “Advice to the Ladies” was made public; and yet I
do not write this to magnify my own invention, but to acquit myself from
grafting on other people’s thoughts.  If I have trespassed upon any
person in the world, it is upon yourself, from whom I had some of the
notions about county banks, and factories for goods, in the chapter of
banks; and yet I do not think that my proposal for the women or the
seamen clashes at all, either with that book, or the public method of
registering seamen.

I have been told since this was done that my proposal for a commission of
inquiries into bankrupt estates is borrowed from the Dutch; if there is
anything like it among the Dutch, it is more than ever I knew, or know
yet; but if so, I hope it is no objection against our having the same
here, especially if it be true that it would be so publicly beneficial as
is expressed.

What is said of friendly societies, I think no man will dispute with me,
since one has met with so much success already in the practice of it.  I
mean the Friendly Society for Widows, of which you have been pleased to
be a governor.

Friendly societies are very extensive, and, as I have hinted, might be
carried on to many particulars.  I have omitted one which was mentioned
in discourse with yourself, where a hundred tradesmen, all of several
trades, agree together to buy whatever they want of one another, and
nowhere else, prices and payments to be settled among themselves; whereby
every man is sure to have ninety-nine customers, and can never want a
trade; and I could have filled up the book with instances of like nature,
but I never designed to fire the reader with particulars.

The proposal of the pension office you will soon see offered to the
public as an attempt for the relief of the poor; which, if it meets with
encouragement, will every way answer all the great things I have said of
it.

I had wrote a great many sheets about the coin, about bringing in plate
to the Mint, and about our standard; but so many great heads being upon
it, with some of whom my opinion does not agree, I would not adventure to
appear in print upon that subject.

Ways and means also I have laid by on the same score: only adhering to
this one point, that be it by taxing the wares they sell, be it by taxing
them in stock, be it by composition—which, by the way, I believe is the
best—be it by what way soever the Parliament please, the retailers are
the men who seem to call upon us to be taxed; if not by their own
extraordinary good circumstances, though that might bear it, yet by the
contrary in all other degrees of the kingdom.

Besides, the retailers are the only men who could pay it with least
damage, because it is in their power to levy it again upon their
customers in the prices of their goods, and is no more than paying a
higher rent for their shops.

The retailers of manufactures, especially so far as relates to the inland
trade, have never been taxed yet, and their wealth or number is not
easily calculated.  Trade and land has been handled roughly enough, and
these are the men who now lie as a reserve to carry on the burden of the
war.

These are the men who, were the land tax collected as it should be, ought
to pay the king more than that whole Bill ever produced; and yet these
are the men who, I think I may venture to say, do not pay a twentieth
part in that Bill.

Should the king appoint a survey over the assessors, and indict all those
who were found faulty, allowing a reward to any discoverer of an
assessment made lower than the literal sense of the Act implies, what a
register of frauds and connivances would be found out!

In a general tax, if any should be excused, it should be the poor, who
are not able to pay, or at least are pinched in the necessary parts of
life by paying.  And yet here a poor labourer, who works for twelve pence
or eighteen pence a day, does not drink a pot of beer but pays the king a
tenth part for excise; and really pays more to the king’s taxes in a year
than a country shopkeeper, who is alderman of the town, worth perhaps two
or three thousand pounds, brews his own beer, pays no excise, and in the
land-tax is rated it may be at £100, and pays £1 4s. per annum, but
ought, if the Act were put in due execution, to pay £36 per annum to the
king.

If I were to be asked how I would remedy this, I would answer, it should
be by some method in which every man may be taxed in the due proportion
to his estate, and the Act put in execution, according to the true intent
and meaning of it, in order to which a commission of assessment should be
granted to twelve men, such as his Majesty should be well satisfied of,
who should go through the whole kingdom, three in a body, and should make
a new assessment of personal estates, not to meddle with land.

To these assessors should all the old rates, parish books, poor rates,
and highway rates, also be delivered; and upon due inquiry to be made
into the manner of living, and reputed wealth of the people, the stock or
personal estate of every man should be assessed, without connivance; and
he who is reputed to be worth a thousand pounds should be taxed at a
thousand pounds, and so on; and he who was an overgrown rich tradesman of
twenty or thirty thousand pounds estate should be taxed so, and plain
English and plain dealing be practised indifferently throughout the
kingdom; tradesmen and landed men should have neighbours’ fare, as we
call it, and a rich man should not be passed by when a poor man pays.

We read of the inhabitants of Constantinople, that they suffered their
city to be lost for want of contributing in time for its defence, and
pleaded poverty to their generous emperor when he went from house to
house to persuade them; and yet when the Turks took it, the prodigious
immense wealth they found in it, made them wonder at the sordid temper of
the citizens.

England (with due exceptions to the Parliament, and the freedom wherewith
they have given to the public charge) is much like Constantinople; we are
involved in a dangerous, a chargeable, but withal a most just and
necessary war, and the richest and moneyed men in the kingdom plead
poverty; and the French, or King James, or the devil may come for them,
if they can but conceal their estates from the public notice, and get the
assessors to tax them at an under rate.

These are the men this commission would discover; and here they should
find men taxed at £500 stock who are worth £20,000.  Here they should
find a certain rich man near Hackney rated to-day in the tax-book at
£1,000 stock, and to-morrow offering £27,000 for an estate.

Here they should find Sir J— C— perhaps taxed to the king at £5,000
stock, perhaps not so much, whose cash no man can guess at; and
multitudes of instances I could give by name without wrong to the
gentlemen.

And, not to run on in particulars, I affirm that in the land-tax ten
certain gentlemen in London put together did not pay for half so much
personal estate, called stock, as the poorest of them is reputed really
to possess.

I do not inquire at whose door this fraud must lie; it is none of my
business.

I wish they would search into it whose power can punish it.  But this,
with submission, I presume to say: The king is thereby defrauded and
horribly abused, the true intent and meaning of Acts of Parliament
evaded, the nation involved in debt by fatal deficiencies and interests,
fellow-subjects abused, and new inventions for taxes occasioned.

The last chapter in this book is a proposal about entering all the seamen
in England into the king’s pay—a subject which deserves to be enlarged
into a book itself; and I have a little volume of calculations and
particulars by me on that head, but I thought them too long to publish.
In short, I am persuaded, was that method proposed to those gentlemen to
whom such things belong, the greatest sum of money might be raised by it,
with the least injury to those who pay it, that ever was or will be
during the war.

Projectors, they say, are generally to be taken with allowance of
one-half at least; they always have their mouths full of millions, and
talk big of their own proposals.  And therefore I have not exposed the
vast sums my calculations amount to; but I venture to say I could procure
a farm on such a proposal as this at three millions per annum, and give
very good security for payment—such an opinion I have of the value of
such a method; and when that is done, the nation would get three more by
paying it, which is very strange, but might easily be made out.

In the chapter of academies I have ventured to reprove the vicious custom
of swearing.  I shall make no apology for the fact, for no man ought to
be ashamed of exposing what all men ought to be ashamed of practising.
But methinks I stand corrected by my own laws a little, in forcing the
reader to repeat some of the worst of our vulgar imprecations, in reading
my thoughts against it; to which, however, I have this to reply:

First, I did not find it easy to express what I mean without putting down
the very words—at least, not so as to be very intelligible.

Secondly, why should words repeated only to expose the vice, taint the
reader more than a sermon preached against lewdness should the
assembly?—for of necessity it leads the hearer to the thoughts of the
fact.  But the morality of every action lies in the end; and if the
reader by ill-use renders himself guilty of the fact in reading, which I
designed to expose by writing, the fault is his, not mine.

I have endeavoured everywhere in this book to be as concise as possible,
except where calculations obliged me to be particular; and having avoided
impertinence in the book, I would avoid it too, in the preface, and
therefore shall break off with subscribing myself,

Sir,

                    Your most obliged, humble servant

                                                                     D. F.




AUTHOR’S INTRODUCTION.


NECESSITY, which is allowed to be the mother of invention, has so
violently agitated the wits of men at this time that it seems not at all
improper, by way of distinction, to call it the Projecting Age.  For
though in times of war and public confusions the like humour of invention
has seemed to stir, yet, without being partial to the present, it is, I
think, no injury to say the past ages have never come up to the degree of
projecting and inventing, as it refers to matters of negotiation and
methods of civil polity, which we see this age arrived to.

Nor is it a hard matter to assign probable causes of the perfection in
this modern art.  I am not of their melancholy opinion who ascribe it to
the general poverty of the nation, since I believe it is easy to prove
the nation itself, taking it as one general stock, is not at all
diminished or impoverished by this long, this chargeable war, but, on the
contrary, was never richer since it was inhabited.

Nor am I absolutely of the opinion that we are so happy as to be wiser in
this age than our forefathers; though at the same time I must own some
parts of knowledge in science as well as art have received improvements
in this age altogether concealed from the former.

The art of war, which I take to be the highest perfection of human
knowledge, is a sufficient proof of what I say, especially in conducting
armies and in offensive engines.  Witness the now ways of rallies,
fougades, entrenchments, attacks, lodgments, and a long _et cetera_ of
new inventions which want names, practised in sieges and encampments;
witness the new forts of bombs and unheard-of mortars, of seven to ten
ton weight, with which our fleets, standing two or three miles off at
sea, can imitate God Almighty Himself and rain fire and brimstone out of
heaven, as it were, upon towns built on the firm land; witness also our
new-invented child of hell, the machine which carries thunder, lightning,
and earthquakes in its bowels, and tears up the most impregnable
fortification.

But if I would search for a cause from whence it comes to pass that this
age swarms with such a multitude of projectors more than usual,
who—besides the innumerable conceptions, which die in the bringing forth,
and (like abortions of the brain) only come into the air and dissolve—do
really every day produce new contrivances, engines, and projects to get
money, never before thought of; if, I say, I would examine whence this
comes to pass, it must be thus:

The losses and depredations which this war brought with it at first were
exceeding many, suffered chiefly by the ill-conduct of merchants
themselves, who did not apprehend the danger to be really what it was:
for before our Admiralty could possibly settle convoys, cruisers, and
stations for men-of-war all over the world, the French covered the sea
with their privateers and took an incredible number of our ships.  I have
heard the loss computed, by those who pretended they were able to guess,
at above fifteen millions of pounds sterling, in ships and goods, in the
first two or three years of the war—a sum which, if put into French,
would make such a rumbling sound of great numbers as would fright a weak
accountant out of his belief, being no less than one hundred and ninety
millions of _livres_.  The weight of this loss fell chiefly on the
trading part of the nation, and, amongst them, on the merchants; and
amongst them, again, upon the most refined capacities, as the insurers,
&c.  And an incredible number of the best merchants in the kingdom sunk
under the load, as may appear a little by a Bill which once passed the
House of Commons for the relief of merchant-insurers, who had suffered by
the war with France.  If a great many fell, much greater were the number
of those who felt a sensible ebb of their fortunes, and with difficulty
bore up under the loss of great part of their estates.  These, prompted
by necessity, rack their wits for new contrivances, new inventions, new
trades, stocks, projects, and anything to retrieve the desperate credit
of their fortunes.  That this is probable to be the cause will appear
further thus.  France (though I do not believe all the great outcries we
make of their misery and distress—if one-half of which be true, they are
certainly the best subjects in the world) yet without question has felt
its share of the losses and damages of the war; but the poverty there
falling chiefly on the poorer sort of people, they have not been so
fruitful in inventions and practices of this nature, their genius being
quite of another strain.  As for the gentry and more capable sort, the
first thing a Frenchman flies to in his distress is the army; and he
seldom comes back from thence to get an estate by painful industry, but
either has his brains knocked out or makes his fortune there.

If industry be in any business rewarded with success it is in the
merchandising part of the world, who indeed may more truly be said to
live by their wits than any people whatsoever.  All foreign negotiation,
though to some it is a plain road by the help of custom, yet is in its
beginning all project, contrivance, and invention.  Every new voyage the
merchant contrives is a project; and ships are sent from port to port, as
markets and merchandises differ, by the help of strange and universal
intelligence—wherein some are so exquisite, so swift, and so exact, that
a merchant sitting at home in his counting-house at once converses with
all parts of the known world.  This and travel make a true-bred merchant
the most intelligent man in the world, and consequently the most capable,
when urged by necessity, to contrive new ways to live.  And from hence, I
humbly conceive, may very properly be derived the projects, so much the
subject of the present discourse.  And to this sort of men it is easy to
trace the original of banks, stocks, stock-jobbing, assurances, friendly
societies, lotteries, and the like.

To this may be added the long annual inquiry in the House of Commons for
ways and means, which has been a particular movement to set all the heads
of the nation at work; and I appeal, with submission, to the gentlemen of
that honourable House, if the greatest part of all the ways and means out
of the common road of land taxes, polls, and the like, have not been
handed to them from the merchant, and in a great measure paid by them
too.

However, I offer this but as an essay at the original of this prevailing
humour of the people; and as it is probable, so it is also possible to be
otherwise, which I submit to future demonstration.

Of the several ways this faculty of projecting have exerted itself, and
of the various methods, as the genius of the authors has inclined, I have
been a diligent observer and, in most, an unconcerned spectator, and
perhaps have some advantage from thence more easily to discover the _faux
pas_ of the actors.  If I have given an essay towards anything new, or
made discovery to advantage of any contrivance now on foot, all men are
at the liberty to make use of the improvement; if any fraud is
discovered, as now practised, it is without any particular reflection
upon parties or persons.

Projects of the nature I treat about are doubtless in general of public
advantage, as they tend to improvement of trade, and employment of the
poor, and the circulation and increase of the public stock of the
kingdom; but this is supposed of such as are built on the honest basis of
ingenuity and improvement, in which, though I will allow the author to
aim primarily at his own advantage, yet with the circumstances of public
benefit added.

Wherefore it is necessary to distinguish among the projects of the
present times between the honest and the dishonest.

There are, and that too many, fair pretences of fine discoveries, new
inventions, engines, and I know not what, which—being advanced in notion,
and talked up to great things to be performed when such and such sums of
money shall be advanced, and such and such engines are made—have raised
the fancies of credulous people to such a height that, merely on the
shadow of expectation, they have formed companies, chose committees,
appointed officers, shares, and books, raised great stocks, and cried up
an empty notion to that degree that people have been betrayed to part
with their money for shares in a new nothing; and when the inventors have
carried on the jest till they have sold all their own interest, they
leave the cloud to vanish of itself, and the poor purchasers to quarrel
with one another, and go to law about settlements, transferrings, and
some bone or other thrown among them by the subtlety of the author to lay
the blame of the miscarriage upon themselves.  Thus the shares at first
begin to fall by degrees, and happy is he that sells in time; till, like
brass money, it will go at last for nothing at all.  So have I seen
shares in joint-stocks, patents, engines, and undertakings, blown up by
the air of great words, and the name of some man of credit concerned, to
£100 for a five-hundredth part or share (some more), and at last dwindle
away till it has been stock-jobbed down to £10, £12, £9, £8 a share, and
at last no buyer (that is, in short, the fine new word for
nothing-worth), and many families ruined by the purchase.  If I should
name linen manufactures, saltpetre-works, copper mines, diving engines,
dipping, and the like, for instances of this, I should, I believe, do no
wrong to truth, or to some persons too visibly guilty.

I might go on upon this subject to expose the frauds and tricks of
stock-jobbers, engineers, patentees, committees, with those Exchange
mountebanks we very properly call brokers, but I have not gaul enough for
such a work; but as a general rule of caution to those who would not be
tricked out of their estates by such pretenders to new inventions, let
them observe that all such people who may be suspected of design have
assuredly this in their proposal: your money to the author must go before
the experiment.  And here I could give a very diverting history of a
patent-monger whose cully was nobody but myself, but I refer it to
another occasion.

But this is no reason why invention upon honest foundations and to fair
purposes should not be encouraged; no, nor why the author of any such
fair contrivances should not reap the harvest of his own ingenuity.  Our
Acts of Parliament for granting patents to first inventors for fourteen
years is a sufficient acknowledgment of the due regard which ought to be
had to such as find out anything which may be of public advantage; new
discoveries in trade, in arts and mysteries, of manufacturing goods, or
improvement of land, are without question of as great benefit as any
discoveries made in the works of nature by all the academies and royal
societies in the world.

There is, it is true, a great difference between new inventions and
projects, between improvement of manufactures or lands (which tend to the
immediate benefit of the public, and employing of the poor), and projects
framed by subtle heads with a sort of a _deceptio visus_ and legerdemain,
to bring people to run needless and unusual hazards: I grant it, and give
a due preference to the first.  And yet success has so sanctified some of
those other sorts of projects that it would be a kind of blasphemy
against fortune to disallow them.  Witness Sir William Phips’s voyage to
the wreck; it was a mere project; a lottery of a hundred thousand to one
odds; a hazard which, if it had failed, everybody would have been ashamed
to have owned themselves concerned in; a voyage that would have been as
much ridiculed as Don Quixote’s adventure upon the windmill.  Bless us!
that folks should go three thousand miles to angle in the open sea for
pieces of eight!  Why, they would have made ballads of it, and the
merchants would have said of every unlikely adventure, “It, was like
Phips’s wreck-voyage.”  But it had success, and who reflects upon the
project?

   “Nothing’s so partial as the laws of fate,
   Erecting blockheads to suppress the great.
   Sir Francis Drake the Spanish plate-fleet won;
   He had been a pirate if he had got none.
   Sir Walter Raleigh strove, but missed the plate,
   And therefore died a traitor to the State.
   Endeavour bears a value more or less,
   Just as ’tis recommended by success:
   The lucky coxcomb ev’ry man will prize,
   And prosp’rous actions always pass for wise.”

However, this sort of projects comes under no reflection as to their
honesty, save that there is a kind of honesty a man owes to himself and
to his family that prohibits him throwing away his estate in
impracticable, improbable adventures; but still some hit, even of the
most unlikely, of which this was one of Sir William Phips, who brought
home a cargo of silver of near £200,000 sterling, in pieces of eight,
fished up out of the open sea, remote from any shore, from an old Spanish
ship which had been sunk above forty years.




THE HISTORY OF PROJECTS.


WHEN I speak of writing a History of Projects, I do not mean either of
the introduction of, or continuing, necessary inventions, or the
improvement of arts and sciences before known, but a short account of
projects and projecting, as the word is allowed in the general
acceptation at this present time; and I need not go far back for the
original of the practice.

Invention of arts, with engines and handicraft instruments for their
improvement, requires a chronology as far back as the eldest son of Adam,
and has to this day afforded some new discovery in every age.

The building of the Ark by Noah, so far as you will allow it a human
work, was the first project I read of; and, no question, seemed so
ridiculous to the graver heads of that wise, though wicked, age that poor
Noah was sufficiently bantered for it: and, had he not been set on work
by a very peculiar direction from heaven, the good old man would
certainly have been laughed out of it as a most senseless ridiculous
project.

The building of Babel was a right project; for indeed the true definition
of a project, according to modern acceptation, is, as is said before, a
vast undertaking, too big to be managed, and therefore likely enough to
come to nothing.  And yet, as great as they are, it is certainly true of
them all, even as the projectors propose: that, according to the old
tale, if so many eggs are hatched, there will be so many chickens, and
those chickens may lay so many eggs more, and those eggs produce so many
chickens more, and so on.  Thus it was most certainly true that if the
people of the Old World could have built a house up to heaven, they
should never be drowned again on earth, and they only had forgot to
measure the height; that is, as in other projects, it only miscarried, or
else it would have succeeded.

And yet, when all is done, that very building, and the incredible height
it was carried, is a demonstration of the vast knowledge of that infant
age of the world, who had no advantage of the experiments or invention of
any before themselves.

   “Thus when our fathers, touched with guilt,
   That huge stupendous staircase built;
   We mock, indeed, the fruitless enterprise
   (For fruitless actions seldom pass for wise),
   But were the mighty ruins left, they’d show
   To what degree that untaught age did know.”

I believe a very diverting account might be given of this, but I shall
not attempt it.  Some are apt to say with Solomon, “No new thing happens
under the sun; but what is, has been:” yet I make no question but some
considerable discovery has been made in these latter ages, and inventions
of human origin produced, which the world was ever without before, either
in whole or in part; and I refer only to two cardinal points, the use of
the loadstone at sea, and the use of gunpowder and guns: both which, as
to the inventing part, I believe the world owes as absolutely to those
particular ages as it does the working in brass and iron to Tubal Cain,
or the inventing of music to Jubal, his brother.  As to engines and
instruments for handicraftsmen, this age, I daresay, can show such as
never were so much as thought of, much less imitated before; for I do not
call that a real invention which has something before done like it—I
account that more properly an improvement.  For handicraft instruments, I
know none owes more to true genuine contrivance, without borrowing from
any former use, than a mechanic engine contrived in our time called a
knitting-frame, which, built with admirable symmetry, works really with a
very happy success, and may be observed by the curious to have a more
than ordinary composition; for which I refer to the engine itself, to be
seen in every stocking-weaver’s garret.

I shall trace the original of the projecting humour that now reigns no
farther back than the year 1680, dating its birth as a monster then,
though by times it had indeed something of life in the time of the late
civil war.  I allow, no age has been altogether without something of this
nature, and some very happy projects are left to us as a taste of their
success; as the water-houses for supplying of the city of London with
water, and, since that, the New River—both very considerable
undertakings, and perfect projects, adventured on the risk of success.
In the reign of King Charles I. infinite projects were set on foot for
raising money without a Parliament: oppressing by monopolies and privy
seals; but these are excluded our scheme as irregularities, for thus the
French are as fruitful in projects as we; and these are rather stratagems
than projects.  After the Fire of London the contrivance of an engine to
quench fires was a project the author was said to get well by, and we
have found to be very useful.  But about the year 1680 began the art and
mystery of projecting to creep into the world.  Prince Rupert, uncle to
King Charles II., gave great encouragement to that part of it that
respects engines and mechanical motions; and Bishop Wilkins added as much
of the theory to it as writing a book could do.  The prince has left us a
metal called by his name; and the first project upon that was, as I
remember, casting of guns of that metal and boring them—done both by a
peculiar method of his own, and which died with him, to the great loss of
the undertaker, who to that purpose had, with no small charge, erected a
water-mill at Hackney Marsh, known by the name of the Temple Mill, which
mill very happily performed all parts of the work; and I have seen some
of those guns on board the Royal Charles, a first-rate ship, being of a
reddish colour, different either from brass or copper.  I have heard some
reasons of state assigned why that project was not permitted to go
forward; but I omit them, because I have no good authority for them.
After this we saw a floating-machine, to be wrought with horses, for the
towing of great ships both against wind and tide; and another for the
raising of ballast, which, as unperforming engines, had the honour of
being made, exposed, tried, and laid by before the prince died.

If thus we introduce it into the world under the conduct of that prince,
when he died it was left a hopeless brat, and had hardly any hand to own
it, till the wreck-voyage before noted, performed so happily by Captain
Phips, afterwards Sir William, whose strange performance set a great many
heads on work to contrive something for themselves.  He was immediately
followed by my Lord Mordant, Sir John Narborough, and others from several
parts, whose success made them soon weary of the work.

The project of the Penny Post, so well known and still practised, I
cannot omit, nor the contriver, Mr. Dockwra, who has had the honour to
have the injury done him in that affair repaired in some measure by the
public justice of the Parliament.  And, the experiment proving it to be a
noble and useful design, the author must be remembered, wherever mention
is made of that affair, to his very great reputation.

It was, no question, a great hardship for a man to be master of so fine a
thought, that had both the essential ends of a project in it (public good
and private want), and that the public should reap the benefit and the
author be left out; the injustice of which, no doubt, discouraged many a
good design.  But since an alteration in public circumstances has
recovered the lost attribute of justice, the like is not to be feared.
And Mr. Dockwra has had the satisfaction to see the former injury
disowned, and an honourable return made, even by them who did not the
injury, in bare respect to his ingenuity.

A while before this several people, under the patronage of some great
persons, had engaged in planting of foreign colonies (as William Penn,
the Lord Shaftesbury, Dr. Cox, and others) in Pennsylvania, Carolina,
East and West Jersey, and the like places, which I do not call projects,
because it was only prosecuting what had been formerly begun.  But here
began the forming of public joint-stocks, which, together with the East
India, African, and Hudson’s Bay Companies, before established, begot a
new trade, which we call by a new name stock-jobbing, which was at first
only the simple occasional transferring of interest and shares from one
to another, as persons alienated their estates; but by the industry of
the Exchange brokers, who got the business into their hands, it became a
trade, and one perhaps managed with the greatest intrigue, artifice, and
trick that ever anything that appeared with a face of honesty could be
handled with; for while the brokers held the box, they made the whole
Exchange the gamesters, and raised and lowered the prices of stocks as
they pleased, and always had both buyers and sellers who stood ready
innocently to commit their money to the mercy of their mercenary tongues.
This upstart of a trade, having tasted the sweetness of success which
generally attends a novel proposal, introduces the illegitimate wandering
object I speak of, as a proper engine to find work for the brokers.  Thus
stock-jobbing nursed projecting, and projecting, in return, has very
diligently pimped for its foster-parent, till both are arrived to be
public grievances, and indeed are now almost grown scandalous.




OF PROJECTORS.


MAN is the worst of all God’s creatures to shift for himself; no other
animal is ever starved to death; nature without has provided them both
food and clothes, and nature within has placed an instinct that never
fails to direct them to proper means for a supply; but man must either
work or starve, slave or die.  He has indeed reason given him to direct
him, and few who follow the dictates of that reason come to such unhappy
exigences; but when by the errors of a man’s youth he has reduced himself
to such a degree of distress as to be absolutely without three
things—money, friends, and health—he dies in a ditch, or in some worse
place, a hospital.

Ten thousand ways there are to bring a man to this, and but very few to
bring him out again.

Death is the universal deliverer, and therefore some who want courage to
bear what they see before them, hang themselves for fear; for certainly
self-destruction is the effect of cowardice in the highest extreme.

Others break the bounds of laws to satisfy that general law of nature,
and turn open thieves, house-breakers, highwaymen, clippers, coiners,
&c., till they run the length of the gallows, and get a deliverance the
nearest way at St. Tyburn.

Others, being masters of more cunning than their neighbours, turn their
thoughts to private methods of trick and cheat, a modern way of thieving
every jot as criminal, and in some degree worse than the other, by which
honest men are gulled with fair pretences to part from their money, and
then left to take their course with the author, who skulks behind the
curtain of a protection, or in the Mint or Friars, and bids defiance as
well to honesty as the law.

Others, yet urged by the same necessity, turn their thoughts to honest
invention, founded upon the platform of ingenuity and integrity.

These two last sorts are those we call projectors; and as there was
always more geese than swans, the number of the latter are very
inconsiderable in comparison of the former; and as the greater number
denominates the less, the just contempt we have of the former sort
bespatters the other, who, like cuckolds, bear the reproach of other
people’s crimes.

A mere projector, then, is a contemptible thing, driven by his own
desperate fortune to such a strait that he must be delivered by a
miracle, or starve; and when he has beat his brains for some such miracle
in vain, he finds no remedy but to paint up some bauble or other, as
players make puppets talk big, to show like a strange thing, and then cry
it up for a new invention, gets a patent for it, divides it into shares,
and they must be sold.  Ways and means are not wanting to swell the new
whim to a vast magnitude; thousands and hundreds of thousands are the
least of his discourse, and sometimes millions, till the ambition of some
honest coxcomb is wheedled to part with his money for it, and then
(_nascitur ridiculus mus_) the adventurer is left to carry on the
project, and the projector laughs at him.  The diver shall walk at the
bottom of the Thames, the saltpetre maker shall build Tom T—d’s pond into
houses, the engineers build models and windmills to draw water, till
funds are raised to carry it on by men who have more money than brains,
and then good-night patent and invention; the projector has done his
business and is gone.

But the honest projector is he who, having by fair and plain principles
of sense, honesty, and ingenuity brought any contrivance to a suitable
perfection, makes out what he pretends to, picks nobody’s pocket, puts
his project in execution, and contents himself with the real produce as
the profit of his invention.




OF BANKS.


BANKS, without question, if rightly managed are, or may be, of great
advantage, especially to a trading people, as the English are; and, among
many others, this is one particular case in which that benefit appears:
that they bring down the interest of money, and take from the goldsmiths,
scriveners, and others, who have command of running cash, their most
delicious trade of making advantage of the necessities of the merchant in
extravagant discounts and premiums for advance of money, when either
large customs or foreign remittances call for disbursements beyond his
common ability; for by the easiness of terms on which the merchant may
have money, he is encouraged to venture further in trade than otherwise
he would do.  Not but that there are other great advantages a Royal Bank
might procure in this kingdom, as has been seen in part by this; as
advancing money to the Exchequer upon Parliamentary funds and securities,
by which in time of a war our preparations for any expedition need not be
in danger of miscarriage for want of money, though the taxes raised be
not speedily paid, nor the Exchequer burthened with the excessive
interests paid in former reigns upon anticipations of the revenue; landed
men might be supplied with moneys upon securities on easier terms, which
would prevent the loss of multitudes of estates, now ruined and devoured
by insolent and merciless mortgagees, and the like.  But now we unhappily
see a Royal Bank established by Act of Parliament, and another with a
large fund upon the Orphans’ stock; and yet these advantages, or others,
which we expected, not answered, though the pretensions in both have not
been wanting at such time as they found it needful to introduce
themselves into public esteem, by giving out prints of what they were
rather able to do than really intended to practise.  So that our having
two banks at this time settled, and more erecting, has not yet been able
to reduce the interest of money, not because the nature and foundation of
their constitution does not tend towards it, but because, finding their
hands full of better business, they are wiser than by being slaves to old
obsolete proposals to lose the advantage of the great improvement they
can make of their stock.

This, however, does not at all reflect on the nature of a bank, nor of
the benefit it would be to the public trading part of the kingdom,
whatever it may seem to do on the practice of the present.  We find four
or five banks now in view to be settled.  I confess I expect no more from
those to come than we have found from the past, and I think I make no
broach on either my charity or good manners in saying so; and I reflect
not upon any of the banks that are or shall be established for not doing
what I mention, but for making such publications of what they would do.
I cannot think any man had expected the Royal Bank should lend money on
mortgages at 4 per cent. (nor was it much the better for them to make
publication they would do so from the beginning of January next after
their settlement), since to this day, as I am informed, they have not
lent one farthing in that manner.

Our banks are indeed nothing but so many goldsmiths’ shops, where the
credit being high (and the directors as high) people lodge their money;
and they—the directors, I mean—make their advantage of it.  If you lay it
at demand, they allow you nothing; if at time, 3 per cent.; and so would
any goldsmith in Lombard Street have done before.  But the very banks
themselves are so awkward in lending, so strict, so tedious, so
inquisitive, and withal so public in their taking securities, that men
who are anything tender won’t go to them; and so the easiness of
borrowing money, so much designed, is defeated.  For here is a private
interest to be made, though it be a public one; and, in short, it is only
a great trade carried on for the private gain of a few concerned in the
original stock; and though we are to hope for great things, because they
have promised them, yet they are all future that we know of.

And yet all this while a bank might be very beneficial to this kingdom;
and this might be so, if either their own ingenuity or public authority
would oblige them to take the public good into equal concern with their
private interest.

To explain what I mean; banks, being established by public authority,
ought also, as all public things are, to be under limitations and
restrictions from that authority; and those limitations being regulated
with a proper regard to the ease of trade in general, and the improvement
of the stock in particular, would make a bank a useful, profitable thing
indeed.

First, a bank ought to be of a magnitude proportioned to the trade of the
country it is in, which this bank is so far from that it is no more to
the whole than the least goldsmith’s cash in Lombard Street is to the
bank, from whence it comes to pass that already more banks are
contriving.  And I question not but banks in London will ere long be as
frequent as lotteries; the consequence of which, in all probability, will
be the diminishing their reputation, or a civil war with one another.  It
is true, the Bank of England has a capital stock; but yet, was that stock
wholly clear of the public concern of the Government, it is not above a
fifth part of what would be necessary to manage the whole business of the
town—which it ought, though not to do, at least to be able to do.  And I
suppose I may venture to say above one-half of the stock of the present
bank is taken up in the affairs of the Exchequer.

I suppose nobody will take this discourse for an invective against the
Bank of England.  I believe it is a very good fund, a very useful one,
and a very profitable one.  It has been useful to the Government, and it
is profitable to the proprietors; and the establishing it at such a
juncture, when our enemies were making great boasts of our poverty and
want of money, was a particular glory to our nation, and the city in
particular.  That when the Paris Gazette informed the world that the
Parliament had indeed given the king grants for raising money in funds to
be paid in remote years, but money was so scarce that no anticipations
could be procured; that just then, besides three millions paid into the
Exchequer that spring on other taxes by way of advance, there was an
overplus-stock to be found of £1,200,000 sterling, or (to make it speak
French) of above fifteen millions, which was all paid voluntarily into
the Exchequer.  Besides this, I believe the present Bank of England has
been very useful to the Exchequer, and to supply the king with
remittances for the payment of the army in Flanders, which has also, by
the way, been very profitable to itself.  But still this bank is not of
that bulk that the business done here requires, nor is it able, with all
the stock it has, to procure the great proposed benefit, the lowering the
interest of money: whereas all foreign banks absolutely govern the
interest, both at Amsterdam, Genoa, and other places.  And this defect I
conceive the multiplicity of banks cannot supply, unless a perfect
understanding could be secured between them.

To remedy this defect, several methods might be proposed.  Some I shall
take the freedom to hint at:—

First, that the present bank increase their stock to at least five
millions sterling, to be settled as they are already, with some small
limitations to make the methods more beneficial.

Five millions sterling is an immense sum; to which add the credit of
their cash, which would supply them with all the overplus-money in the
town, and probably might amount to half as much more; and then the credit
of running bills, which by circulating would, no question, be an
equivalent to the other half: so that in stock, credit, and bank-bills
the balance of their cash would be always ten millions sterling—a sum
that everybody who can talk of does not understand.

But then to find business for all this stock, which, though it be a
strange thing to think of, is nevertheless easy when it comes to be
examined.  And first for the business; this bank should enlarge the
number of their directors, as they do of their stock, and should then
establish several sub-committees, composed of their own members, who
should have the directing of several offices relating to the distinct
sorts of business they referred to, to be overruled and governed by the
governor and directors in a body, but to have a conclusive power as to
contracts.  Of these there should be—

One office for loan of money for customs of goods, which by a plain
method might be so ordered that the merchant might with ease pay the
highest customs down, and so, by allowing the bank 4 per cent. advance,
be first sure to secure the £10 per cent. which the king allows for
prompt payment at the Custom House, and be also freed from the
troublesome work of finding bondsmen and securities for the money—which
has exposed many a man to the tyranny of extents, either for himself or
his friend, to his utter ruin, who under a more moderate prosecution had
been able to pay all his debts, and by this method has been torn to
pieces and disabled from making any tolerable proposal to his creditors.
This is a scene of large business, and would, in proportion, employ a
large cash, and it is the easiest thing in the world to make the bank the
paymaster of all the large customs, and yet the merchant have so
honourable a possession of his goods, as may be neither any diminution to
his reputation or any hindrance to their sale.

As, for example, suppose I have 100 hogsheads of tobacco to import, whose
customs by several duties come to £1,000, and want cash to clear them.  I
go with my bill of loading to the bank, who appoint their officer to
enter the goods and pay the duties, which goods, so entered by the bank,
shall give them title enough to any part, or the whole, without the
trouble of bills of sale, or conveyances, defeasances, and the like.  The
goods are carried to a warehouse at the waterside, where the merchant has
a free and public access to them, as if in his own warehouse and an
honourable liberty to sell and deliver either the whole (paying their
disburse) or a part without it, leaving but sufficient for the payment,
and out of that part delivered, either by notes under the hand of the
purchaser, or any other way, he may clear the same, without any
exactions, but of £4 per cent., and the rest are his own.

The ease this would bring to trade, the deliverance it would bring to the
merchants from the insults of goldsmiths, &c., and the honour it would
give to our management of public imposts, with the advantages to the
Custom House itself, and the utter destruction of extortion, would be
such as would give a due value to the bank, and make all mankind
acknowledge it to be a public good.  The grievance of exactions upon
merchants in this case is very great, and when I lay the blame on the
goldsmiths, because they are the principal people made use of in such
occasions, I include a great many other sorts of brokers and
money-jobbing artists, who all get a snip out of the merchant.  I myself
have known a goldsmith in Lombard Street lend a man £700 to pay the
customs of a hundred pipes of Spanish wines; the wines were made over to
him for security by bill of sale, and put into a cellar, of which the
goldsmith kept the key; the merchant was to pay £6 per cent. interest on
the bond, and to allow £10 percent. premium for advancing the money.
When he had the wines in possession the owner could not send his cooper
to look after them, but the goldsmith’s man must attend all the while,
for which he would be paid 5s. a day.  If he brought a customer to see
them, the goldsmith’s man must show them.  The money was lent for two
months.  He could not be admitted to sell or deliver a pipe of wine out
single, or two or three at a time, as he might have sold them; but on a
word or two spoken amiss to the goldsmith (or which he was pleased to
take so), he would have none sold but the wh﻿THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF ROBINSON CRUSOE


CHAPTER I--REVISITS ISLAND


That homely proverb, used on so many occasions in England, viz. "That
what is bred in the bone will not go out of the flesh," was never more
verified than in the story of my Life.  Any one would think that after
thirty-five years' affliction, and a variety of unhappy circumstances,
which few men, if any, ever went through before, and after near seven
years of peace and enjoyment in the fulness of all things; grown old, and
when, if ever, it might be allowed me to have had experience of every
state of middle life, and to know which was most adapted to make a man
completely happy; I say, after all this, any one would have thought that
the native propensity to rambling which I gave an account of in my first
setting out in the world to have been so predominant in my thoughts,
should be worn out, and I might, at sixty one years of age, have been a
little inclined to stay at home, and have done venturing life and fortune
any more.

Nay, farther, the common motive of foreign adventures was taken away in
me, for I had no fortune to make; I had nothing to seek: if I had gained
ten thousand pounds I had been no richer; for I had already sufficient
for me, and for those I had to leave it to; and what I had was visibly
increasing; for, having no great family, I could not spend the income of
what I had unless I would set up for an expensive way of living, such as
a great family, servants, equipage, gaiety, and the like, which were
things I had no notion of, or inclination to; so that I had nothing,
indeed, to do but to sit still, and fully enjoy what I had got, and see
it increase daily upon my hands.  Yet all these things had no effect upon
me, or at least not enough to resist the strong inclination I had to go
abroad again, which hung about me like a chronic distemper.  In
particular, the desire of seeing my new plantation in the island, and the
colony I left there, ran in my head continually.  I dreamed of it all
night, and my imagination ran upon it all day: it was uppermost in all my
thoughts, and my fancy worked so steadily and strongly upon it that I
talked of it in my sleep; in short, nothing could remove it out of my
mind: it even broke so violently into all my discourses that it made my
conversation tiresome, for I could talk of nothing else; all my discourse
ran into it, even to impertinence; and I saw it myself.

I have often heard persons of good judgment say that all the stir that
people make in the world about ghosts and apparitions is owing to the
strength of imagination, and the powerful operation of fancy in their
minds; that there is no such thing as a spirit appearing, or a ghost
walking; that people's poring affectionately upon the past conversation
of their deceased friends so realises it to them that they are capable of
fancying, upon some extraordinary circumstances, that they see them, talk
to them, and are answered by them, when, in truth, there is nothing but
shadow and vapour in the thing, and they really know nothing of the
matter.

For my part, I know not to this hour whether there are any such things as
real apparitions, spectres, or walking of people after they are dead; or
whether there is anything in the stories they tell us of that kind more
than the product of vapours, sick minds, and wandering fancies: but this
I know, that my imagination worked up to such a height, and brought me
into such excess of vapours, or what else I may call it, that I actually
supposed myself often upon the spot, at my old castle, behind the trees;
saw my old Spaniard, Friday's father, and the reprobate sailors I left
upon the island; nay, I fancied I talked with them, and looked at them
steadily, though I was broad awake, as at persons just before me; and
this I did till I often frightened myself with the images my fancy
represented to me.  One time, in my sleep, I had the villainy of the
three pirate sailors so lively related to me by the first Spaniard, and
Friday's father, that it was surprising: they told me how they
barbarously attempted to murder all the Spaniards, and that they set fire
to the provisions they had laid up, on purpose to distress and starve
them; things that I had never heard of, and that, indeed, were never all
of them true in fact: but it was so warm in my imagination, and so
realised to me, that, to the hour I saw them, I could not be persuaded
but that it was or would be true; also how I resented it, when the
Spaniard complained to me; and how I brought them to justice, tried them,
and ordered them all three to be hanged.  What there was really in this
shall be seen in its place; for however I came to form such things in my
dream, and what secret converse of spirits injected it, yet there was, I
say, much of it true.  I own that this dream had nothing in it literally
and specifically true; but the general part was so true--the base;
villainous behaviour of these three hardened rogues was such, and had
been so much worse than all I can describe, that the dream had too much
similitude of the fact; and as I would afterwards have punished them
severely, so, if I had hanged them all, I had been much in the right, and
even should have been justified both by the laws of God and man.

But to return to my story.  In this kind of temper I lived some years; I
had no enjoyment of my life, no pleasant hours, no agreeable diversion
but what had something or other of this in it; so that my wife, who saw
my mind wholly bent upon it, told me very seriously one night that she
believed there was some secret, powerful impulse of Providence upon me,
which had determined me to go thither again; and that she found nothing
hindered me going but my being engaged to a wife and children.  She told
me that it was true she could not think of parting with me: but as she
was assured that if she was dead it would be the first thing I would do,
so, as it seemed to her that the thing was determined above, she would
not be the only obstruction; for, if I thought fit and resolved to
go--[Here she found me very intent upon her words, and that I looked very
earnestly at her, so that it a little disordered her, and she stopped.  I
asked her why she did not go on, and say out what she was going to say?
But I perceived that her heart was too full, and some tears stood in her
eyes.]  "Speak out, my dear," said I; "are you willing I should
go?"--"No," says she, very affectionately, "I am far from willing; but if
you are resolved to go," says she, "rather than I would be the only
hindrance, I will go with you: for though I think it a most preposterous
thing for one of your years, and in your condition, yet, if it must be,"
said she, again weeping, "I would not leave you; for if it be of Heaven
you must do it, there is no resisting it; and if Heaven make it your duty
to go, He will also make it mine to go with you, or otherwise dispose of
me, that I may not obstruct it."

This affectionate behaviour of my wife's brought me a little out of the
vapours, and I began to consider what I was doing; I corrected my
wandering fancy, and began to argue with myself sedately what business I
had after threescore years, and after such a life of tedious sufferings
and disasters, and closed in so happy and easy a manner; I, say, what
business had I to rush into new hazards, and put myself upon adventures
fit only for youth and poverty to run into?

With those thoughts I considered my new engagement; that I had a wife,
one child born, and my wife then great with child of another; that I had
all the world could give me, and had no need to seek hazard for gain;
that I was declining in years, and ought to think rather of leaving what
I had gained than of seeking to increase it; that as to what my wife had
said of its being an impulse from Heaven, and that it should be my duty
to go, I had no notion of that; so, after many of these cogitations, I
struggled with the power of my imagination, reasoned myself out of it, as
I believe people may always do in like cases if they will: in a word, I
conquered it, composed myself with such arguments as occurred to my
thoughts, and which my present condition furnished me plentifully with;
and particularly, as the most effectual method, I resolved to divert
myself with other things, and to engage in some business that might
effectually tie me up from any more excursions of this kind; for I found
that thing return upon me chiefly when I was idle, and had nothing to do,
nor anything of moment immediately before me.  To this purpose, I bought
a little farm in the county of Bedford, and resolved to remove myself
thither.  I had a little convenient house upon it, and the land about it,
I found, was capable of great improvement; and it was many ways suited to
my inclination, which delighted in cultivating, managing, planting, and
improving of land; and particularly, being an inland country, I was
removed from conversing among sailors and things relating to the remote
parts of the world.  I went down to my farm, settled my family, bought
ploughs, harrows, a cart, waggon-horses, cows, and sheep, and, setting
seriously to work, became in one half-year a mere country gentleman.  My
thoughts were entirely taken up in managing my servants, cultivating the
ground, enclosing, planting, &c.; and I lived, as I thought, the most
agreeable life that nature was capable of directing, or that a man always
bred to misfortunes was capable of retreating to.

I farmed upon my own land; I had no rent to pay, was limited by no
articles; I could pull up or cut down as I pleased; what I planted was
for myself, and what I improved was for my family; and having thus left
off the thoughts of wandering, I had not the least discomfort in any part
of life as to this world.  Now I thought, indeed, that I enjoyed the
middle state of life which my father so earnestly recommended to me, and
lived a kind of heavenly life, something like what is described by the
poet, upon the subject of a country life:--

   "Free from vices, free from care,
   Age has no pain, and youth no snare."

But in the middle of all this felicity, one blow from unseen Providence
unhinged me at once; and not only made a breach upon me inevitable and
incurable, but drove me, by its consequences, into a deep relapse of the
wandering disposition, which, as I may say, being born in my very blood,
soon recovered its hold of me; and, like the returns of a violent
distemper, came on with an irresistible force upon me.  This blow was the
loss of my wife.  It is not my business here to write an elegy upon my
wife, give a character of her particular virtues, and make my court to
the sex by the flattery of a funeral sermon.  She was, in a few words,
the stay of all my affairs; the centre of all my enterprises; the engine
that, by her prudence, reduced me to that happy compass I was in, from
the most extravagant and ruinous project that filled my head, and did
more to guide my rambling genius than a mother's tears, a father's
instructions, a friend's counsel, or all my own reasoning powers could
do.  I was happy in listening to her, and in being moved by her
entreaties; and to the last degree desolate and dislocated in the world
by the loss of her.

When she was gone, the world looked awkwardly round me.  I was as much a
stranger in it, in my thoughts, as I was in the Brazils, when I first
went on shore there; and as much alone, except for the assistance of
servants, as I was in my island.  I knew neither what to think nor what
to do.  I saw the world busy around me: one part labouring for bread,
another part squandering in vile excesses or empty pleasures, but equally
miserable because the end they proposed still fled from them; for the men
of pleasure every day surfeited of their vice, and heaped up work for
sorrow and repentance; and the men of labour spent their strength in
daily struggling for bread to maintain the vital strength they laboured
with: so living in a daily circulation of sorrow, living but to work, and
working but to live, as if daily bread were the only end of wearisome
life, and a wearisome life the only occasion of daily bread.

This put me in mind of the life I lived in my kingdom, the island; where
I suffered no more corn to grow, because I did not want it; and bred no
more goats, because I had no more use for them; where the money lay in
the drawer till it grew mouldy, and had scarce the favour to be looked
upon in twenty years.  All these things, had I improved them as I ought
to have done, and as reason and religion had dictated to me, would have
taught me to search farther than human enjoyments for a full felicity;
and that there was something which certainly was the reason and end of
life superior to all these things, and which was either to be possessed,
or at least hoped for, on this side of the grave.

But my sage counsellor was gone; I was like a ship without a pilot, that
could only run afore the wind.  My thoughts ran all away again into the
old affair; my head was quite turned with the whimsies of foreign
adventures; and all the pleasant, innocent amusements of my farm, my
garden, my cattle, and my family, which before entirely possessed me,
were nothing to me, had no relish, and were like music to one that has no
ear, or food to one that has no taste.  In a word, I resolved to leave
off housekeeping, let my farm, and return to London; and in a few months
after I did so.

When I came to London, I was still as uneasy as I was before; I had no
relish for the place, no employment in it, nothing to do but to saunter
about like an idle person, of whom it may be said he is perfectly useless
in God's creation, and it is not one farthing's matter to the rest of his
kind whether he be dead or alive.  This also was the thing which, of all
circumstances of life, was the most my aversion, who had been all my days
used to an active life; and I would often say to myself, "A state of
idleness is the very dregs of life;" and, indeed, I thought I was much
more suitably employed when I was twenty-six days making a deal board.

It was now the beginning of the year 1693, when my nephew, whom, as I
have observed before, I had brought up to the sea, and had made him
commander of a ship, was come home from a short voyage to Bilbao, being
the first he had made.  He came to me, and told me that some merchants of
his acquaintance had been proposing to him to go a voyage for them to the
East Indies, and to China, as private traders.  "And now, uncle," says
he, "if you will go to sea with me, I will engage to land you upon your
old habitation in the island; for we are to touch at the Brazils."

Nothing can be a greater demonstration of a future state, and of the
existence of an invisible world, than the concurrence of second causes
with the idea of things which we form in our minds, perfectly reserved,
and not communicated to any in the world.

My nephew knew nothing how far my distemper of wandering was returned
upon me, and I knew nothing of what he had in his thought to say, when
that very morning, before he came to me, I had, in a great deal of
confusion of thought, and revolving every part of my circumstances in my
mind, come to this resolution, that I would go to Lisbon, and consult
with my old sea-captain; and if it was rational and practicable, I would
go and see the island again, and what was become of my people there.  I
had pleased myself with the thoughts of peopling the place, and carrying
inhabitants from hence, getting a patent for the possession and I know
not what; when, in the middle of all this, in comes my nephew, as I have
said, with his project of carrying me thither in his way to the East
Indies.

I paused a while at his words, and looking steadily at him, "What devil,"
said I, "sent you on this unlucky errand?"  My nephew stared as if he had
been frightened at first; but perceiving that I was not much displeased
at the proposal, he recovered himself.  "I hope it may not be an unlucky
proposal, sir," says he.  "I daresay you would be pleased to see your new
colony there, where you once reigned with more felicity than most of your
brother monarchs in the world."  In a word, the scheme hit so exactly
with my temper, that is to say, the prepossession I was under, and of
which I have said so much, that I told him, in a few words, if he agreed
with the merchants, I would go with him; but I told him I would not
promise to go any further than my own island.  "Why, sir," says he, "you
don't want to be left there again, I hope?"  "But," said I, "can you not
take me up again on your return?"  He told me it would not be possible to
do so; that the merchants would never allow him to come that way with a
laden ship of such value, it being a month's sail out of his way, and
might be three or four.  "Besides, sir, if I should miscarry," said he,
"and not return at all, then you would be just reduced to the condition
you were in before."

This was very rational; but we both found out a remedy for it, which was
to carry a framed sloop on board the ship, which, being taken in pieces,
might, by the help of some carpenters, whom we agreed to carry with us,
be set up again in the island, and finished fit to go to sea in a few
days.  I was not long resolving, for indeed the importunities of my
nephew joined so effectually with my inclination that nothing could
oppose me; on the other hand, my wife being dead, none concerned
themselves so much for me as to persuade me one way or the other, except
my ancient good friend the widow, who earnestly struggled with me to
consider my years, my easy circumstances, and the needless hazards of a
long voyage; and above all, my young children.  But it was all to no
purpose, I had an irresistible desire for the voyage; and I told her I
thought there was something so uncommon in the impressions I had upon my
mind, that it would be a kind of resisting Providence if I should attempt
to stay at home; after which she ceased her expostulations, and joined
with me, not only in making provision for my voyage, but also in settling
my family affairs for my absence, and providing for the education of my
children.  In order to do this, I made my will, and settled the estate I
had in such a manner for my children, and placed in such hands, that I
was perfectly easy and satisfied they would have justice done them,
whatever might befall me; and for their education, I left it wholly to
the widow, with a sufficient maintenance to herself for her care: all
which she richly deserved; for no mother could have taken more care in
their education, or understood it better; and as she lived till I came
home, I also lived to thank her for it.

My nephew was ready to sail about the beginning of January 1694-5; and I,
with my man Friday, went on board, in the Downs, the 8th; having, besides
that sloop which I mentioned above, a very considerable cargo of all
kinds of necessary things for my colony, which, if I did not find in good
condition, I resolved to leave so.

First, I carried with me some servants whom I purposed to place there as
inhabitants, or at least to set on work there upon my account while I
stayed, and either to leave them there or carry them forward, as they
should appear willing; particularly, I carried two carpenters, a smith,
and a very handy, ingenious fellow, who was a cooper by trade, and was
also a general mechanic; for he was dexterous at making wheels and hand-
mills to grind corn, was a good turner and a good pot-maker; he also made
anything that was proper to make of earth or of wood: in a word, we
called him our Jack-of-all-trades.  With these I carried a tailor, who
had offered himself to go a passenger to the East Indies with my nephew,
but afterwards consented to stay on our new plantation, and who proved a
most necessary handy fellow as could be desired in many other businesses
besides that of his trade; for, as I observed formerly, necessity arms us
for all employments.

My cargo, as near as I can recollect, for I have not kept account of the
particulars, consisted of a sufficient quantity of linen, and some
English thin stuffs, for clothing the Spaniards that I expected to find
there; and enough of them, as by my calculation might comfortably supply
them for seven years; if I remember right, the materials I carried for
clothing them, with gloves, hats, shoes, stockings, and all such things
as they could want for wearing, amounted to about two hundred pounds,
including some beds, bedding, and household stuff, particularly kitchen
utensils, with pots, kettles, pewter, brass, &c.; and near a hundred
pounds more in ironwork, nails, tools of every kind, staples, hooks,
hinges, and every necessary thing I could think of.

I carried also a hundred spare arms, muskets, and fusees; besides some
pistols, a considerable quantity of shot of all sizes, three or four tons
of lead, and two pieces of brass cannon; and, because I knew not what
time and what extremities I was providing for, I carried a hundred
barrels of powder, besides swords, cutlasses, and the iron part of some
pikes and halberds.  In short, we had a large magazine of all sorts of
store; and I made my nephew carry two small quarter-deck guns more than
he wanted for his ship, to leave behind if there was occasion; so that
when we came there we might build a fort and man it against all sorts of
enemies.  Indeed, I at first thought there would be need enough for all,
and much more, if we hoped to maintain our possession of the island, as
shall be seen in the course of that story.

I had not such bad luck in this voyage as I had been used to meet with,
and therefore shall have the less occasion to interrupt the reader, who
perhaps may be impatient to hear how matters went with my colony; yet
some odd accidents, cross winds and bad weather happened on this first
setting out, which made the voyage longer than I expected it at first;
and I, who had never made but one voyage, my first voyage to Guinea, in
which I might be said to come back again, as the voyage was at first
designed, began to think the same ill fate attended me, and that I was
born to be never contented with being on shore, and yet to be always
unfortunate at sea.  Contrary winds first put us to the northward, and we
were obliged to put in at Galway, in Ireland, where we lay wind-bound two-
and-twenty days; but we had this satisfaction with the disaster, that
provisions were here exceeding cheap, and in the utmost plenty; so that
while we lay here we never touched the ship's stores, but rather added to
them.  Here, also, I took in several live hogs, and two cows with their
calves, which I resolved, if I had a good passage, to put on shore in my
island; but we found occasion to dispose otherwise of them.

We set out on the 5th of February from Ireland, and had a very fair gale
of wind for some days.  As I remember, it might be about the 20th of
February in the evening late, when the mate, having the watch, came into
the round-house and told us he saw a flash of fire, and heard a gun
fired; and while he was telling us of it, a boy came in and told us the
boatswain heard another.  This made us all run out upon the quarter-deck,
where for a while we heard nothing; but in a few minutes we saw a very
great light, and found that there was some very terrible fire at a
distance; immediately we had recourse to our reckonings, in which we all
agreed that there could be no land that way in which the fire showed
itself, no, not for five hundred leagues, for it appeared at WNW.  Upon
this, we concluded it must be some ship on fire at sea; and as, by our
hearing the noise of guns just before, we concluded that it could not be
far off, we stood directly towards it, and were presently satisfied we
should discover it, because the further we sailed, the greater the light
appeared; though, the weather being hazy, we could not perceive anything
but the light for a while.  In about half-an-hour's sailing, the wind
being fair for us, though not much of it, and the weather clearing up a
little, we could plainly discern that it was a great ship on fire in the
middle of the sea.

I was most sensibly touched with this disaster, though not at all
acquainted with the persons engaged in it; I presently recollected my
former circumstances, and what condition I was in when taken up by the
Portuguese captain; and how much more deplorable the circumstances of the
poor creatures belonging to that ship must be, if they had no other ship
in company with them.  Upon this I immediately ordered that five guns
should be fired, one soon after another, that, if possible, we might give
notice to them that there was help for them at hand and that they might
endeavour to save themselves in their boat; for though we could see the
flames of the ship, yet they, it being night, could see nothing of us.

We lay by some time upon this, only driving as the burning ship drove,
waiting for daylight; when, on a sudden, to our great terror, though we
had reason to expect it, the ship blew up in the air; and in a few
minutes all the fire was out, that is to say, the rest of the ship sunk.
This was a terrible, and indeed an afflicting sight, for the sake of the
poor men, who, I concluded, must be either all destroyed in the ship, or
be in the utmost distress in their boat, in the middle of the ocean;
which, at present, as it was dark, I could not see.  However, to direct
them as well as I could, I caused lights to be hung out in all parts of
the ship where we could, and which we had lanterns for, and kept firing
guns all the night long, letting them know by this that there was a ship
not far off.

About eight o'clock in the morning we discovered the ship's boats by the
help of our perspective glasses, and found there were two of them, both
thronged with people, and deep in the water.  We perceived they rowed,
the wind being against them; that they saw our ship, and did their utmost
to make us see them.  We immediately spread our ancient, to let them know
we saw them, and hung a waft out, as a signal for them to come on board,
and then made more sail, standing directly to them.  In little more than
half-an-hour we came up with them; and took them all in, being no less
than sixty-four men, women, and children; for there were a great many
passengers.

Upon inquiry we found it was a French merchant ship of three-hundred
tons, home-bound from Quebec.  The master gave us a long account of the
distress of his ship; how the fire began in the steerage by the
negligence of the steersman, which, on his crying out for help, was, as
everybody thought, entirely put out; but they soon found that some sparks
of the first fire had got into some part of the ship so difficult to come
at that they could not effectually quench it; and afterwards getting in
between the timbers, and within the ceiling of the ship, it proceeded
into the hold, and mastered all the skill and all the application they
were able to exert.

They had no more to do then but to get into their boats, which, to their
great comfort, were pretty large; being their long-boat, and a great
shallop, besides a small skiff, which was of no great service to them,
other than to get some fresh water and provisions into her, after they
had secured their lives from the fire.  They had, indeed, small hopes of
their lives by getting into these boats at that distance from any land;
only, as they said, that they thus escaped from the fire, and there was a
possibility that some ship might happen to be at sea, and might take them
in.  They had sails, oars, and a compass; and had as much provision and
water as, with sparing it so as to be next door to starving, might
support them about twelve days, in which, if they had no bad weather and
no contrary winds, the captain said he hoped he might get to the banks of
Newfoundland, and might perhaps take some fish, to sustain them till they
might go on shore.  But there were so many chances against them in all
these cases, such as storms, to overset and founder them; rains and cold,
to benumb and perish their limbs; contrary winds, to keep them out and
starve them; that it must have been next to miraculous if they had
escaped.

In the midst of their consternation, every one being hopeless and ready
to despair, the captain, with tears in his eyes, told me they were on a
sudden surprised with the joy of hearing a gun fire, and after that four
more: these were the five guns which I caused to be fired at first seeing
the light.  This revived their hearts, and gave them the notice, which,
as above, I desired it should, that there was a ship at hand for their
help.  It was upon the hearing of these guns that they took down their
masts and sails: the sound coming from the windward, they resolved to lie
by till morning.  Some time after this, hearing no more guns, they fired
three muskets, one a considerable while after another; but these, the
wind being contrary, we never heard.  Some time after that again they
were still more agreeably surprised with seeing our lights, and hearing
the guns, which, as I have said, I caused to be fired all the rest of the
night.  This set them to work with their oars, to keep their boats ahead,
at least that we might the sooner come up with them; and at last, to
their inexpressible joy, they found we saw them.

It is impossible for me to express the several gestures, the strange
ecstasies, the variety of postures which these poor delivered people ran
into, to express the joy of their souls at so unexpected a deliverance.
Grief and fear are easily described: sighs, tears, groans, and a very few
motions of the head and hands, make up the sum of its variety; but an
excess of joy, a surprise of joy, has a thousand extravagances in it.
There were some in tears; some raging and tearing themselves, as if they
had been in the greatest agonies of sorrow; some stark raving and
downright lunatic; some ran about the ship stamping with their feet,
others wringing their hands; some were dancing, some singing, some
laughing, more crying, many quite dumb, not able to speak a word; others
sick and vomiting; several swooning and ready to faint; and a few were
crossing themselves and giving God thanks.

I would not wrong them either; there might be many that were thankful
afterwards; but the passion was too strong for them at first, and they
were not able to master it: then were thrown into ecstasies, and a kind
of frenzy, and it was but a very few that were composed and serious in
their joy.  Perhaps also, the case may have some addition to it from the
particular circumstance of that nation they belonged to: I mean the
French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, more passionate, and
more sprightly, and their spirits more fluid than in other nations.  I am
not philosopher enough to determine the cause; but nothing I had ever
seen before came up to it.  The ecstasies poor Friday, my trusty savage,
was in when he found his father in the boat came the nearest to it; and
the surprise of the master and his two companions, whom I delivered from
the villains that set them on shore in the island, came a little way
towards it; but nothing was to compare to this, either that I saw in
Friday, or anywhere else in my life.

It is further observable, that these extravagances did not show
themselves in that different manner I have mentioned, in different
persons only; but all the variety would appear, in a short succession of
moments, in one and the same person.  A man that we saw this minute dumb,
and, as it were, stupid and confounded, would the next minute be dancing
and hallooing like an antic; and the next moment be tearing his hair, or
pulling his clothes to pieces, and stamping them under his feet like a
madman; in a few moments after that we would have him all in tears, then
sick, swooning, and, had not immediate help been had, he would in a few
moments have been dead.  Thus it was, not with one or two, or ten or
twenty, but with the greatest part of them; and, if I remember right, our
surgeon was obliged to let blood of about thirty persons.

There were two priests among them: one an old man, and the other a young
man; and that which was strangest was, the oldest man was the worst.  As
soon as he set his foot on board our ship, and saw himself safe, he
dropped down stone dead to all appearance.  Not the least sign of life
could be perceived in him; our surgeon immediately applied proper
remedies to recover him, and was the only man in the ship that believed
he was not dead.  At length he opened a vein in his arm, having first
chafed and rubbed the part, so as to warm it as much as possible.  Upon
this the blood, which only dropped at first, flowing freely, in three
minutes after the man opened his eyes; a quarter of an hour after that he
spoke, grew better, and after the blood was stopped, he walked about,
told us he was perfectly well, and took a dram of cordial which the
surgeon gave him.  About a quarter of an hour after this they came
running into the cabin to the surgeon, who was bleeding a Frenchwoman
that had fainted, and told him the priest was gone stark mad.  It seems
he had begun to revolve the change of his circumstances in his mind, and
again this put him into an ecstasy of joy.  His spirits whirled about
faster than the vessels could convey them, the blood grew hot and
feverish, and the man was as fit for Bedlam as any creature that ever was
in it.  The surgeon would not bleed him again in that condition, but gave
him something to doze and put him to sleep; which, after some time,
operated upon him, and he awoke next morning perfectly composed and well.
The younger priest behaved with great command of his passions, and was
really an example of a serious, well-governed mind.  At his first coming
on board the ship he threw himself flat on his face, prostrating himself
in thankfulness for his deliverance, in which I unhappily and
unseasonably disturbed him, really thinking he had been in a swoon; but
he spoke calmly, thanked me, told me he was giving God thanks for his
deliverance, begged me to leave him a few moments, and that, next to his
Maker, he would give me thanks also.  I was heartily sorry that I
disturbed him, and not only left him, but kept others from interrupting
him also.  He continued in that posture about three minutes, or little
more, after I left him, then came to me, as he had said he would, and
with a great deal of seriousness and affection, but with tears in his
eyes, thanked me, that had, under God, given him and so many miserable
creatures their lives.  I told him I had no need to tell him to thank God
for it, rather than me, for I had seen that he had done that already; but
I added that it was nothing but what reason and humanity dictated to all
men, and that we had as much reason as he to give thanks to God, who had
blessed us so far as to make us the instruments of His mercy to so many
of His creatures.  After this the young priest applied himself to his
countrymen, and laboured to compose them: he persuaded, entreated,
argued, reasoned with them, and did his utmost to keep them within the
exercise of their reason; and with some he had success, though others
were for a time out of all government of themselves.

I cannot help committing this to writing, as perhaps it may be useful to
those into whose hands it may fall, for guiding themselves in the
extravagances of their passions; for if an excess of joy can carry men
out to such a length beyond the reach of their reason, what will not the
extravagances of anger, rage, and a provoked mind carry us to?  And,
indeed, here I saw reason for keeping an exceeding watch over our
passions of every kind, as well those of joy and satisfaction as those of
sorrow and anger.

We were somewhat disordered by these extravagances among our new guests
for the first day; but after they had retired to lodgings provided for
them as well as our ship would allow, and had slept heartily--as most of
them did, being fatigued and frightened--they were quite another sort of
people the next day.  Nothing of good manners, or civil acknowledgments
for the kindness shown them, was wanting; the French, it is known, are
naturally apt enough to exceed that way.  The captain and one of the
priests came to me the next day, and desired to speak with me and my
nephew; the commander began to consult with us what should be done with
them; and first, they told us we had saved their lives, so all they had
was little enough for a return to us for that kindness received.  The
captain said they had saved some money and some things of value in their
boats, caught hastily out of the flames, and if we would accept it they
were ordered to make an offer of it all to us; they only desired to be
set on shore somewhere in our way, where, if possible, they might get a
passage to France.  My nephew wished to accept their money at first word,
and to consider what to do with them afterwards; but I overruled him in
that part, for I knew what it was to be set on shore in a strange
country; and if the Portuguese captain that took me up at sea had served
me so, and taken all I had for my deliverance, I must have been starved,
or have been as much a slave at the Brazils as I had been at Barbary, the
mere being sold to a Mahometan excepted; and perhaps a Portuguese is not
a much better master than a Turk, if not in some cases much worse.

I therefore told the French captain that we had taken them up in their
distress, it was true, but that it was our duty to do so, as we were
fellow-creatures; and we would desire to be so delivered if we were in
the like or any other extremity; that we had done nothing for them but
what we believed they would have done for us if we had been in their case
and they in ours; but that we took them up to save them, not to plunder
them; and it would be a most barbarous thing to take that little from
them which they had saved out of the fire, and then set them on shore and
leave them; that this would be first to save them from death, and then
kill them ourselves: save them from drowning, and abandon them to
starving; and therefore I would not let the least thing be taken from
them.  As to setting them on shore, I told them indeed that was an
exceeding difficulty to us, for that the ship was bound to the East
Indies; and though we were driven out of our course to the westward a
very great way, and perhaps were directed by Heaven on purpose for their
deliverance, yet it was impossible for us wilfully to change our voyage
on their particular account; nor could my nephew, the captain, answer it
to the freighters, with whom he was under charter to pursue his voyage by
way of Brazil; and all I knew we could do for them was to put ourselves
in the way of meeting with other ships homeward bound from the West
Indies, and get them a passage, if possible, to England or France.

The first part of the proposal was so generous and kind they could not
but be very thankful for it; but they were in very great consternation,
especially the passengers, at the notion of being carried away to the
East Indies; they then entreated me that as I was driven so far to the
westward before I met with them, I would at least keep on the same course
to the banks of Newfoundland, where it was probable I might meet with
some ship or sloop that they might hire to carry them back to Canada.

I thought this was but a reasonable request on their part, and therefore
I inclined to agree to it; for indeed I considered that to carry this
whole company to the East Indies would not only be an intolerable
severity upon the poor people, but would be ruining our whole voyage by
devouring all our provisions; so I thought it no breach of charter-party,
but what an unforeseen accident made absolutely necessary to us, and in
which no one could say we were to blame; for the laws of God and nature
would have forbid that we should refuse to take up two boats full of
people in such a distressed condition; and the nature of the thing, as
well respecting ourselves as the poor people, obliged us to set them on
shore somewhere or other for their deliverance.  So I consented that we
would carry them to Newfoundland, if wind and weather would permit: and
if not, I would carry them to Martinico, in the West Indies.

The wind continued fresh easterly, but the weather pretty good; and as
the winds had continued in the points between NE. and SE. a long time, we
missed several opportunities of sending them to France; for we met
several ships bound to Europe, whereof two were French, from St.
Christopher's, but they had been so long beating up against the wind that
they durst take in no passengers, for fear of wanting provisions for the
voyage, as well for themselves as for those they should take in; so we
were obliged to go on.  It was about a week after this that we made the
banks of Newfoundland; where, to shorten my story, we put all our French
people on board a bark, which they hired at sea there, to put them on
shore, and afterwards to carry them to France, if they could get
provisions to victual themselves with.  When I say all the French went on
shore, I should remember that the young priest I spoke of, hearing we
were bound to the East Indies, desired to go the voyage with us, and to
be set on shore on the coast of Coromandel; which I readily agreed to,
for I wonderfully liked the man, and had very good reason, as will appear
afterwards; also four of the seamen entered themselves on our ship, and
proved very useful fellows.

From hence we directed our course for the West Indies, steering away S.
and S. by E. for about twenty days together, sometimes little or no wind
at all; when we met with another subject for our humanity to work upon,
almost as deplorable as that before.




CHAPTER II--INTERVENING HISTORY OF COLONY


It was in the latitude of 27 degrees 5 minutes N., on the 19th day of
March 1694-95, when we spied a sail, our course SE. and by S.  We soon
perceived it was a large vessel, and that she bore up to us, but could
not at first know what to make of her, till, after coming a little
nearer, we found she had lost her main-topmast, fore-mast, and bowsprit;
and presently she fired a gun as a signal of distress.  The weather was
pretty good, wind at NNW. a fresh gale, and we soon came to speak with
her.  We found her a ship of Bristol, bound home from Barbadoes, but had
been blown out of the road at Barbadoes a few days before she was ready
to sail, by a terrible hurricane, while the captain and chief mate were
both gone on shore; so that, besides the terror of the storm, they were
in an indifferent case for good mariners to bring the ship home.  They
had been already nine weeks at sea, and had met with another terrible
storm, after the hurricane was over, which had blown them quite out of
their knowledge to the westward, and in which they lost their masts.  They
told us they expected to have seen the Bahama Islands, but were then
driven away again to the south-east, by a strong gale of wind at NNW.,
the same that blew now: and having no sails to work the ship with but a
main course, and a kind of square sail upon a jury fore-mast, which they
had set up, they could not lie near the wind, but were endeavouring to
stand away for the Canaries.

But that which was worst of all was, that they were almost starved for
want of provisions, besides the fatigues they had undergone; their bread
and flesh were quite gone--they had not one ounce left in the ship, and
had had none for eleven days.  The only relief they had was, their water
was not all spent, and they had about half a barrel of flour left; they
had sugar enough; some succades, or sweetmeats, they had at first, but
these were all devoured; and they had seven casks of rum.  There was a
youth and his mother and a maid-servant on board, who were passengers,
and thinking the ship was ready to sail, unhappily came on board the
evening before the hurricane began; and having no provisions of their own
left, they were in a more deplorable condition than the rest: for the
seamen being reduced to such an extreme necessity themselves, had no
compassion, we may be sure, for the poor passengers; and they were,
indeed, in such a condition that their misery is very hard to describe.

I had perhaps not known this part, if my curiosity had not led me, the
weather being fair and the wind abated, to go on board the ship.  The
second mate, who upon this occasion commanded the ship, had been on board
our ship, and he told me they had three passengers in the great cabin
that were in a deplorable condition.  "Nay," says he, "I believe they are
dead, for I have heard nothing of them for above two days; and I was
afraid to inquire after them," said he, "for I had nothing to relieve
them with."  We immediately applied ourselves to give them what relief we
could spare; and indeed I had so far overruled things with my nephew,
that I would have victualled them though we had gone away to Virginia, or
any other part of the coast of America, to have supplied ourselves; but
there was no necessity for that.

But now they were in a new danger; for they were afraid of eating too
much, even of that little we gave them.  The mate, or commander, brought
six men with him in his boat; but these poor wretches looked like
skeletons, and were so weak that they could hardly sit to their oars.  The
mate himself was very ill, and half starved; for he declared he had
reserved nothing from the men, and went share and share alike with them
in every bit they ate.  I cautioned him to eat sparingly, and set meat
before him immediately, but he had not eaten three mouthfuls before he
began to be sick and out of order; so he stopped a while, and our surgeon
mixed him up something with some broth, which he said would be to him
both food and physic; and after he had taken it he grew better.  In the
meantime I forgot not the men.  I ordered victuals to be given them, and
the poor creatures rather devoured than ate it: they were so exceedingly
hungry that they were in a manner ravenous, and had no command of
themselves; and two of them ate with so much greediness that they were in
danger of their lives the next morning.  The sight of these people's
distress was very moving to me, and brought to mind what I had a terrible
prospect of at my first coming on shore in my island, where I had not the
least mouthful of food, or any prospect of procuring any; besides the
hourly apprehensions I had of being made the food of other creatures.  But
all the while the mate was thus relating to me the miserable condition of
the ship's company, I could not put out of my thought the story he had
told me of the three poor creatures in the great cabin, viz. the mother,
her son, and the maid-servant, whom he had heard nothing of for two or
three days, and whom, he seemed to confess, they had wholly neglected,
their own extremities being so great; by which I understood that they had
really given them no food at all, and that therefore they must be
perished, and be all lying dead, perhaps, on the floor or deck of the
cabin.

As I therefore kept the mate, whom we then called captain, on board with
his men, to refresh them, so I also forgot not the starving crew that
were left on board, but ordered my own boat to go on board the ship, and,
with my mate and twelve men, to carry them a sack of bread, and four or
five pieces of beef to boil.  Our surgeon charged the men to cause the
meat to be boiled while they stayed, and to keep guard in the cook-room,
to prevent the men taking it to eat raw, or taking it out of the pot
before it was well boiled, and then to give every man but a very little
at a time: and by this caution he preserved the men, who would otherwise
have killed themselves with that very food that was given them on purpose
to save their lives.

At the same time I ordered the mate to go into the great cabin, and see
what condition the poor passengers were in; and if they were alive, to
comfort them, and give them what refreshment was proper: and the surgeon
gave him a large pitcher, with some of the prepared broth which he had
given the mate that was on board, and which he did not question would
restore them gradually.  I was not satisfied with this; but, as I said
above, having a great mind to see the scene of misery which I knew the
ship itself would present me with, in a more lively manner than I could
have it by report, I took the captain of the ship, as we now called him,
with me, and went myself, a little after, in their boat.

I found the poor men on board almost in a tumult to get the victuals out
of the boiler before it was ready; but my mate observed his orders, and
kept a good guard at the cook-room door, and the man he placed there,
after using all possible persuasion to have patience, kept them off by
force; however, he caused some biscuit-cakes to be dipped in the pot, and
softened with the liquor of the meat, which they called brewis, and gave
them every one some to stay their stomachs, and told them it was for
their own safety that he was obliged to give them but little at a time.
But it was all in vain; and had I not come on board, and their own
commander and officers with me, and with good words, and some threats
also of giving them no more, I believe they would have broken into the
cook-room by force, and torn the meat out of the furnace--for words are
indeed of very small force to a hungry belly; however, we pacified them,
and fed them gradually and cautiously at first, and the next time gave
them more, and at last filled their bellies, and the men did well enough.

But the misery of the poor passengers in the cabin was of another nature,
and far beyond the rest; for as, first, the ship's company had so little
for themselves, it was but too true that they had at first kept them very
low, and at last totally neglected them: so that for six or seven t to the worst of
deaths.  But this was not all: we saw the fire increase forward, and the
cry went on just as the fire went on; so that we were in the utmost
confusion.  We advanced a little way farther, and behold, to our
astonishment, three naked women, and crying in a most dreadful manner,
came flying as if they had wings, and after them sixteen or seventeen
men, natives, in the same terror and consternation, with three of our
English butchers in the rear, who, when they could not overtake them,
fired in among them, and one that was killed by their shot fell down in
our sight.  When the rest saw us, believing us to be their enemies, and
that we would murder them as well as those that pursued them, they set up
a most dreadful shriek, especially the women; and two of them fell down,
as if already dead, with the fright.

My very soul shrunk within me, and my blood ran chill in my veins, when I
saw this; and, I believe, had the three English sailors that pursued them
come on, I had made our men kill them all; however, we took some means to
let the poor flying creatures know that we would not hurt them; and
immediately they came up to us, and kneeling down, with their hands
lifted up, made piteous lamentation to us to save them, which we let them
know we would: whereupon they crept all together in a huddle close behind
us, as for protection.  I left my men drawn up together, and, charging
them to hurt nobody, but, if possible, to get at some of our people, and
see what devil it was possessed them, and what they intended to do, and
to command them off; assuring them that if they stayed till daylight they
would have a hundred thousand men about their ears: I say I left them,
and went among those flying people, taking only two of our men with me;
and there was, indeed, a piteous spectacle among them.  Some of them had
their feet terribly burned with trampling and running through the fire;
others their hands burned; one of the women had fallen down in the fire,
and was very much burned before she could get out again; and two or three
of the men had cuts in their backs and thighs, from our men pursuing; and
another was shot through the body and died while I was there.

I would fain have learned what the occasion of all this was; but I could
not understand one word they said; though, by signs, I perceived some of
them knew not what was the occasion themselves.  I was so terrified in my
thoughts at this outrageous attempt that I could not stay there, but went
back to my own men, and resolved to go into the middle of the town,
through the fire, or whatever might be in the way, and put an end to it,
cost what it would; accordingly, as I came back to my men, I told them my
resolution, and commanded them to follow me, when, at the very moment,
came four of our men, with the boatswain at their head, roving over heaps
of bodies they had killed, all covered with blood and dust, as if they
wanted more people to massacre, when our men hallooed to them as loud as
they could halloo; and with much ado one of them made them hear, so that
they knew who we were, and came up to us.

As soon as the boatswain saw us, he set up a halloo like a shout of
triumph, for having, as he thought, more help come; and without waiting
to hear me, "Captain," says he, "noble captain!  I am glad you are come;
we have not half done yet.  Villainous hell-hound dogs!  I'll kill as
many of them as poor Tom has hairs upon his head: we have sworn to spare
none of them; we'll root out the very nation of them from the earth;" and
thus he ran on, out of breath, too, with action, and would not give us
leave to speak a word.  At last, raising my voice that I might silence
him a little, "Barbarous dog!" said I, "what are you doing!  I won't have
one creature touched more, upon pain of death; I charge you, upon your
life, to stop your hands, and stand still here, or you are a dead man
this minute."--"Why, sir," says he, "do you know what you do, or what
they have done?  If you want a reason for what we have done, come
hither;" and with that he showed me the poor fellow hanging, with his
throat cut.

I confess I was urged then myself, and at another time would have been
forward enough; but I thought they had carried their rage too far, and
remembered Jacob's words to his sons Simeon and Levi: "Cursed be their
anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel."  But I had
now a new task upon my hands; for when the men I had carried with me saw
the sight, as I had done, I had as much to do to restrain them as I
should have had with the others; nay, my nephew himself fell in with
them, and told me, in their hearing, that he was only concerned for fear
of the men being overpowered; and as to the people, he thought not one of
them ought to live; for they had all glutted themselves with the murder
of the poor man, and that they ought to be used like murderers.  Upon
these words, away ran eight of my men, with the boatswain and his crew,
to complete their bloody work; and I, seeing it quite out of my power to
restrain them, came away pensive and sad; for I could not bear the sight,
much less the horrible noise and cries of the poor wretches that fell
into their hands.

I got nobody to come back with me but the supercargo and two men, and
with these walked back to the boat.  It was a very great piece of folly
in me, I confess, to venture back, as it were, alone; for as it began now
to be almost day, and the alarm had run over the country, there stood
about forty men armed with lances and boughs at the little place where
the twelve or thirteen houses stood, mentioned before: but by accident I
missed the place, and came directly to the seaside, and by the time I got
to the seaside it was broad day: immediately I took the pinnace and went
on board, and sent her back to assist the men in what might happen.  I
observed, about the time that I came to the boat-side, that the fire was
pretty well out, and the noise abated; but in about half-an-hour after I
got on board, I heard a volley of our men's firearms, and saw a great
smoke.  This, as I understood afterwards, was our men falling upon the
men, who, as I said, stood at the few houses on the way, of whom they
killed sixteen or seventeen, and set all the houses on fire, but did not
meddle with the women or children.

By the time the men got to the shore again with the pinnace our men began
to appear; they came dropping in, not in two bodies as they went, but
straggling here and there in such a manner, that a small force of
resolute men might have cut them all off.  But the dread of them was upon
the whole country; and the men were surprised, and so frightened, that I
believe a hundred of them would have fled at the sight of but five of our
men.  Nor in all this terrible action was there a man that made any
considerable defence: they were so surprised between the terror of the
fire and the sudden attack of our men in the dark, that they knew not
which way to turn themselves; for if they fled one way they were met by
one party, if back again by another, so that they were everywhere knocked
down; nor did any of our men receive the least hurt, except one that
sprained his foot, and another that had one of his hands burned.




CHAPTER X--HE IS LEFT ON SHORE


I was very angry with my nephew, the captain, and indeed with all the
men, but with him in particular, as well for his acting so out of his
duty as a commander of the ship, and having the charge of the voyage upon
him, as in his prompting, rather than cooling, the rage of his blind men
in so bloody and cruel an enterprise.  My nephew answered me very
respectfully, but told me that when he saw the body of the poor seaman
whom they had murdered in so cruel and barbarous a manner, he was not
master of himself, neither could he govern his passion; he owned he
should not have done so, as he was commander of the ship; but as he was a
man, and nature moved him, he could not bear it.  As for the rest of the
men, they were not subject to me at all, and they knew it well enough; so
they took no notice of my dislike.  The next day we set sail, so we never
heard any more of it.  Our men differed in the account of the number they
had killed; but according to the best of their accounts, put all
together, they killed or destroyed about one hundred and fifty people,
men, women, and children, and left not a house standing in the town.  As
for the poor fellow Tom Jeffry, as he was quite dead (for his throat was
so cut that his head was half off), it would do him no service to bring
him away; so they only took him down from the tree, where he was hanging
by one hand.

However just our men thought this action, I was against them in it, and I
always, after that time, told them God would blast the voyage; for I
looked upon all the blood they shed that night to be murder in them.  For
though it is true that they had killed Tom Jeffry, yet Jeffry was the
aggressor, had broken the truce, and had ill-used a young woman of
theirs, who came down to them innocently, and on the faith of the public
capitulation.

The boatswain defended this quarrel when we were afterwards on board.  He
said it was true that we seemed to break the truce, but really had not;
and that the war was begun the night before by the natives themselves,
who had shot at us, and killed one of our men without any just
provocation; so that as we were in a capacity to fight them now, we might
also be in a capacity to do ourselves justice upon them in an
extraordinary manner; that though the poor man had taken a little liberty
with the girl, he ought not to have been murdered, and that in such a
villainous manner: and that they did nothing but what was just and what
the laws of God allowed to be done to murderers.  One would think this
should have been enough to have warned us against going on shore amongst
the heathens and barbarians; but it is impossible to make mankind wise
but at their own expense, and their experience seems to be always of most
use to them when it is dearest bought.

We were now bound to the Gulf of Persia, and from thence to the coast of
Coromandel, only to touch at Surat; but the chief of the supercargo's
design lay at the Bay of Bengal, where, if he missed his business outward-
bound, he was to go out to China, and return to the coast as he came
home.  The first disaster that befell us was in the Gulf of Persia, where
five of our men, venturing on shore on the Arabian side of the gulf, were
surrounded by the Arabians, and either all killed or carried away into
slavery; the rest of the boat's crew were not able to rescue them, and
had but just time to get off their boat.  I began to upbraid them with
the just retribution of Heaven in this case; but the boatswain very
warmly told me, he thought I went further in my censures than I could
show any warrant for in Scripture; and referred to Luke xiii. 4, where
our Saviour intimates that those men on whom the Tower of Siloam fell
were not sinners above all the Galileans; but that which put me to
silence in the case was, that not one of these five men who were now lost
were of those who went on shore to the massacre of Madagascar, so I
always called it, though our men could not bear to hear the word
_massacre_ with any patience.

But my frequent preaching to them on this subject had worse consequences
than I expected; and the boatswain, who had been the head of the attempt,
came up boldly to me one time, and told me he found that I brought that
affair continually upon the stage; that I made unjust reflections upon
it, and had used the men very ill on that account, and himself in
particular; that as I was but a passenger, and had no command in the
ship, or concern in the voyage, they were not obliged to bear it; that
they did not know but I might have some ill-design in my head, and
perhaps to call them to an account for it when they came to England; and
that, therefore, unless I would resolve to have done with it, and also
not to concern myself any further with him, or any of his affairs, he
would leave the ship; for he did not think it safe to sail with me among
them.

I heard him patiently enough till he had done, and then told him that I
confessed I had all along opposed the massacre of Madagascar, and that I
had, on all occasions, spoken my mind freely about it, though not more
upon him than any of the rest; that as to having no command in the ship,
that was true; nor did I exercise any authority, only took the liberty of
speaking my mind in things which publicly concerned us all; and what
concern I had in the voyage was none of his business; that I was a
considerable owner in the ship.  In that claim I conceived I had a right
to speak even further than I had done, and would not be accountable to
him or any one else, and began to be a little warm with him.  He made but
little reply to me at that time, and I thought the affair had been over.
We were at this time in the road at Bengal; and being willing to see the
place, I went on shore with the supercargo in the ship's boat to divert
myself; and towards evening was preparing to go on board, when one of the
men came to me, and told me he would not have me trouble myself to come
down to the boat, for they had orders not to carry me on board any more.
Any one may guess what a surprise I was in at so insolent a message; and
I asked the man who bade him deliver that message to me?  He told me the
coxswain.

I immediately found out the supercargo, and told him the story, adding
that I foresaw there would be a mutiny in the ship; and entreated him to
go immediately on board and acquaint the captain of it.  But I might have
spared this intelligence, for before I had spoken to him on shore the
matter was effected on board.  The boatswain, the gunner, the carpenter,
and all the inferior officers, as soon as I was gone off in the boat,
came up, and desired to speak with the captain; and then the boatswain,
making a long harangue, and repeating all he had said to me, told the
captain that as I was now gone peaceably on shore, they were loath to use
any violence with me, which, if I had not gone on shore, they would
otherwise have done, to oblige me to have gone.  They therefore thought
fit to tell him that as they shipped themselves to serve in the ship
under his command, they would perform it well and faithfully; but if I
would not quit the ship, or the captain oblige me to quit it, they would
all leave the ship, and sail no further with him; and at that word _all_
he turned his face towards the main-mast, which was, it seems, a signal
agreed on, when the seamen, being got together there, cried out, "_One
and all_! _one and all_!"

My nephew, the captain, was a man of spirit, and of great presence of
mind; and though he was surprised, yet he told them calmly that he would
consider of the matter, but that he could do nothing in it till he had
spoken to me about it.  He used some arguments with them, to show them
the unreasonableness and injustice of the thing, but it was all in vain;
they swore, and shook hands round before his face, that they would all go
on shore unless he would engage to them not to suffer me to come any more
on board the ship.

This was a hard article upon him, who knew his obligation to me, and did
not know how I might take it.  So he began to talk smartly to them; told
them that I was a very considerable owner of the ship, and that if ever
they came to England again it would cost them very dear; that the ship
was mine, and that he could not put me out of it; and that he would
rather lose the ship, and the voyage too, than disoblige me so much: so
they might do as they pleased.  However, he would go on shore and talk
with me, and invited the boatswain to go with him, and perhaps they might
accommodate the matter with me.  But they all rejected the proposal, and
said they would have nothing to do with me any more; and if I came on
board they would all go on shore.  "Well," said the captain, "if you are
all of this mind, let me go on shore and talk with him."  So away he came
to me with this account, a little after the message had been brought to
me from the coxswain.

I was very glad to see my nephew, I must confess; for I was not without
apprehensions that they would confine him by violence, set sail, and run
away with the ship; and then I had been stripped naked in a remote
country, having nothing to help myself; in short, I had been in a worse
case than when I was alone in the island.  But they had not come to that
length, it seems, to my satisfaction; and when my nephew told me what
they had said to him, and how they had sworn and shook hands that they
would, one and all, leave the ship if I was suffered to come on board, I
told him he should not be concerned at it at all, for I would stay on
shore.  I only desired he would take care and send me all my necessary
things on shore, and leave me a sufficient sum of money, and I would find
my way to England as well as I could.  This was a heavy piece of news to
my nephew, but there was no way to help it but to comply; so, in short,
he went on board the ship again, and satisfied the men that his uncle had
yielded to their importunity, and had sent for his goods from on board
the ship; so that the matter was over in a few hours, the men returned to
their duty, and I began to consider what course I should steer.

I was now alone in a most remote part of the world, for I was near three
thousand leagues by sea farther off from England than I was at my island;
only, it is true, I might travel here by land over the Great Mogul's
country to Surat, might go from thence to Bassora by sea, up the Gulf of
Persia, and take the way of the caravans, over the desert of Arabia, to
Aleppo and Scanderoon; from thence by sea again to Italy, and so overland
into France.  I had another way before me, which was to wait for some
English ships, which were coming to Bengal from Achin, on the island of
Sumatra, and get passage on board them from England.  But as I came
hither without any concern with the East Indian Company, so it would be
difficult to go from hence without their licence, unless with great
favour of the captains of the ships, or the company's factors: and to
both I was an utter stranger.

Here I had the mortification to see the ship set sail without me;
however, my nephew left me two servants, or rather one companion and one
servant; the first was clerk to the purser, whom he engaged to go with
me, and the other was his own servant.  I then took a good lodging in the
house of an Englishwoman, where several merchants lodged, some French,
two Italians, or rather Jews, and one Englishman.  Here I stayed above
nine months, considering what course to take.  I had some English goods
with me of value, and a considerable sum of money; my nephew furnishing
me with a thousand pieces of eight, and a letter of credit for more if I
had occasion, that I might not be straitened, whatever might happen.  I
quickly disposed of my goods to advantage; and, as I originally intended,
I bought here some very good diamonds, which, of all other things, were
the most proper for me in my present circumstances, because I could
always carry my whole estate about me.

During my stay here many proposals were made for my return to England,
but none falling out to my mind, the English merchant who lodged with me,
and whom I had contracted an intimate acquaintance with, came to me one
morning, saying: "Countryman, I have a project to communicate, which, as
it suits with my thoughts, may, for aught I know, suit with yours also,
when you shall have thoroughly considered it.  Here we are posted, you by
accident and I by my own choice, in a part of the world very remote from
our own country; but it is in a country where, by us who understand trade
and business, a great deal of money is to be got.  If you will put one
thousand pounds to my one thousand pounds, we will hire a ship here, the
first we can get to our minds.  You shall be captain, I'll be merchant,
and we'll go a trading voyage to China; for what should we stand still
for?  The whole world is in motion; why should we be idle?"

I liked this proposal very well; and the more so because it seemed to be
expressed with so much goodwill.  In my loose, unhinged circumstances, I
was the fitter to embrace a proposal for trade, or indeed anything else.
I might perhaps say with some truth, that if trade was not my element,
rambling was; and no proposal for seeing any part of the world which I
had never seen before could possibly come amiss to me.  It was, however,
some time before we could get a ship to our minds, and when we had got a
vessel, it was not easy to get English sailors--that is to say, so many
as were necessary to govern the voyage and manage the sailors which we
should pick up there.  After some time we got a mate, a boatswain, and a
gunner, English; a Dutch carpenter, and three foremast men.  With these
we found we could do well enough, having Indian seamen, such as they
were, to make up.

When all was ready we set sail for Achin, in the island of Sumatra, and
from thence to Siam, where we exchanged some of our wares for opium and
some arrack; the first a commodity which bears a great price among the
Chinese, and which at that time was much wanted there.  Then we went up
to Saskan, were eight months out, and on our return to Bengal I was very
well satisfied with my adventure.  Our people in England often admire how
officers, which the company send into India, and the merchants which
generally stay there, get such very great estates as they do, and
sometimes come home worth sixty or seventy thousand pounds at a time; but
it is little matter for wonder, when we consider the innumerable ports
and places where they have a free commerce; indeed, at the ports where
the English ships come there is such great and constant demands for the
growth of all other countries, that there is a certain vent for the
returns, as well as a market abroad for the goods carried out.

I got so much money by my first adventure, and such an insight into the
method of getting more, that had I been twenty years younger, I should
have been tempted to have stayed here, and sought no farther for making
my fortune; but what was all this to a man upwards of threescore, that
was rich enough, and came abroad more in obedience to a restless desire
of seeing the world than a covetous desire of gaining by it?  A restless
desire it really was, for when I was at home I was restless to go abroad;
and when I was abroad I was restless to be at home.  I say, what was this
gain to me?  I was rich enough already, nor had I any uneasy desires
about getting more money; therefore the profit of the voyage to me was of
no great force for the prompting me forward to further undertakings.
Hence, I thought that by this voyage I had made no progress at all,
because I was come back, as I might call it, to the place from whence I
came, as to a home: whereas, my eye, like that which Solomon speaks of,
was never satisfied with seeing.  I was come into a part of the world
which I was never in before, and that part, in particular, which I heard
much of, and was resolved to see as much of it as I could: and then I
thought I might say I had seen all the world that was worth seeing.

But my fellow-traveller and I had different notions: I acknowledge his
were the more suited to the end of a merchant's life: who, when he is
abroad upon adventures, is wise to stick to that, as the best thing for
him, which he is likely to get the most money by.  On the other hand,
mine was the notion of a mad, rambling boy, that never cares to see a
thing twice over.  But this was not all: I had a kind of impatience upon
me to be nearer home, and yet an unsettled resolution which way to go.  In
the interval of these consultations, my friend, who was always upon the
search for business, proposed another voyage among the Spice Islands, to
bring home a loading of cloves from the Manillas, or thereabouts.

We were not long in preparing for this voyage; the chief difficulty was
in bringing me to come into it.  However, at last, nothing else offering,
and as sitting still, to me especially, was the unhappiest part of life,
I resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully, touching
at Borneo and several other islands, and came home in about five months,
when we sold our spices, with very great profit, to the Persian
merchants, who carried them away to the Gulf.  My friend, when we made up
this account, smiled at me: "Well, now," said he, with a sort of friendly
rebuke on my indolent temper, "is not this better than walking about
here, like a man with nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at
the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?"--"Why, truly," said I, "my
friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of
merchandising; but I must tell you, by the way, you do not know what I am
doing; for if I once conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, old as
I am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I tire you; for I
shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still."




CHAPTER XI--WARNED OF DANGER BY A COUNTRYMAN


A little while after this there came in a Dutch ship from Batavia; she
was a coaster, not an European trader, of about two hundred tons burden;
the men, as they pretended, having been so sickly that the captain had
not hands enough to go to sea with, so he lay by at Bengal; and having,
it seems, got money enough, or being willing, for other reasons, to go
for Europe, he gave public notice he would sell his ship.  This came to
my ears before my new partner heard of it, and I had a great mind to buy
it; so I went to him and told him of it.  He considered a while, for he
was no rash man neither; and at last replied, "She is a little too
big--however, we will have her."  Accordingly, we bought the ship, and
agreeing with the master, we paid for her, and took possession.  When we
had done so we resolved to engage the men, if we could, to join with
those we had, for the pursuing our business; but, on a sudden, they
having received not their wages, but their share of the money, as we
afterwards learned, not one of them was to be found; we inquired much
about them, and at length were told that they were all gone together by
land to Agra, the great city of the Mogul's residence, to proceed from
thence to Surat, and then go by sea to the Gulf of Persia.

Nothing had so much troubled me a good while as that I should miss the
opportunity of going with them; for such a ramble, I thought, and in such
company as would both have guarded and diverted me, would have suited
mightily with my great design; and I should have both seen the world and
gone homeward too.  But I was much better satisfied a few days after,
when I came to know what sort of fellows they were; for, in short, their
history was, that this man they called captain was the gunner only, not
the commander; that they had been a trading voyage, in which they had
been attacked on shore by some of the Malays, who had killed the captain
and three of his men; and that after the captain was killed, these men,
eleven in number, having resolved to run away with the ship, brought her
to Bengal, leaving the mate and five men more on shore.

Well, let them get the ship how they would, we came honestly by her, as
we thought, though we did not, I confess, examine into things so exactly
as we ought; for we never inquired anything of the seamen, who would
certainly have faltered in their account, and contradicted one another.
Somehow or other we should have had reason to have suspected, them; but
the man showed us a bill of sale for the ship, to one Emanuel
Clostershoven, or some such name, for I suppose it was all a forgery, and
called himself by that name, and we could not contradict him: and withal,
having no suspicion of the thing, we went through with our bargain.  We
picked up some more English sailors here after this, and some Dutch, and
now we resolved on a second voyage to the south-east for cloves, &c.--that
is to say, among the Philippine and Malacca isles.  In short, not to fill
up this part of my story with trifles when what is to come is so
remarkable, I spent, from first to last, six years in this country,
trading from port to port, backward and forward, and with very good
success, and was now the last year with my new partner, going in the ship
above mentioned, on a voyage to China, but designing first to go to Siam
to buy rice.

In this voyage, being by contrary winds obliged to beat up and down a
great while in the Straits of Malacca and among the islands, we were no
sooner got clear of those difficult seas than we found our ship had
sprung a leak, but could not discover where it was.  This forced us to
make some port; and my partner, who knew the country better than I did,
directed the captain to put into the river of Cambodia; for I had made
the English mate, one Mr. Thompson, captain, not being willing to take
the charge of the ship upon myself.  This river lies on the north side of
the great bay or gulf which goes up to Siam.  While we were here, and
going often on shore for refreshment, there comes to me one day an
Englishman, a gunner's mate on board an English East India ship, then
riding in the same river.  "Sir," says he, addressing me, "you are a
stranger to me, and I to you; but I have something to tell you that very
nearly concerns you.  I am moved by the imminent danger you are in, and,
for aught I see, you have no knowledge of it."--"I know no danger I am
in," said I, "but that my ship is leaky, and I cannot find it out; but I
intend to lay her aground to-morrow, to see if I can find it."--"But,
sir," says he, "leaky or not leaky, you will be wiser than to lay your
ship on shore to-morrow when you hear what I have to say to you.  Do you
know, sir," said he, "the town of Cambodia lies about fifteen leagues up
the river; and there are two large English ships about five leagues on
this side, and three Dutch?"--"Well," said I, "and what is that to
me?"--"Why, sir," said be, "is it for a man that is upon such adventures
as you are to come into a port, and not examine first what ships there
are there, and whether he is able to deal with them?  I suppose you do
not think you are a match for them?"  I could not conceive what he meant;
and I turned short upon him, and said: "I wish you would explain
yourself; I cannot imagine what reason I have to be afraid of any of the
company's ships, or Dutch ships.  I am no interloper.  What can they have
to say to me?"--"Well, sir," says he, with a smile, "if you think
yourself secure you must take your chance; but take my advice, if you do
not put to sea immediately, you will the very next tide be attacked by
five longboats full of men, and perhaps if you are taken you will be
hanged for a pirate, and the particulars be examined afterwards.  I
thought, sir," added he, "I should have met with a better reception than
this for doing you a piece of service of such importance."--"I can never
be ungrateful," said I, "for any service, or to any man that offers me
any kindness; but it is past my comprehension what they should have such
a design upon me for: however, since you say there is no time to be lost,
and that there is some villainous design on hand against me, I will go on
board this minute, and put to sea immediately, if my men can stop the
leak; but, sir," said I, "shall I go away ignorant of the cause of all
this?  Can you give me no further light into it?"

"I can tell you but part of the story, sir," says he; "but I have a Dutch
seaman here with me, and I believe I could persuade him to tell you the
rest; but there is scarce time for it.  But the short of the story is
this--the first part of which I suppose you know well enough--that you
were with this ship at Sumatra; that there your captain was murdered by
the Malays, with three of his men; and that you, or some of those that
were on board with you, ran away with the ship, and are since turned
pirates.  This is the sum of the story, and you will all be seized as
pirates, I can assure you, and executed with very little ceremony; for
you know merchant ships show but little law to pirates if they get them
into their power."--"Now you speak plain English," said I, "and I thank
you; and though I know nothing that we have done like what you talk of,
for I am sure we came honestly and fairly by the ship; yet seeing such a
work is doing, as you say, and that you seem to mean honestly, I will be
upon my guard."--"Nay, sir," says he, "do not talk of being upon your
guard; the best defence is to be out of danger.  If you have any regard
for your life and the lives of all your men, put to sea without fail at
high-water; and as you have a whole tide before you, you will be gone too
far out before they can come down; for they will come away at high-water,
and as they have twenty miles to come, you will get near two hours of
them by the difference of the tide, not reckoning the length of the way:
besides, as they are only boats, and not ships, they will not venture to
follow you far out to sea, especially if it blows."--"Well," said I, "you
have been very kind in this: what shall I do to make you amends?"--"Sir,"
says he, "you may not be willing to make me any amends, because you may
not be convinced of the truth of it.  I will make an offer to you: I have
nineteen months' pay due to me on board the ship ---, which I came out of
England in; and the Dutchman that is with me has seven months' pay due to
him.  If you will make good our pay to us we will go along with you; if
you find nothing more in it we will desire no more; but if we do convince
you that we have saved your lives, and the ship, and the lives of all the
men in her, we will leave the rest to you."

I consented to this readily, and went immediately on board, and the two
men with me.  As soon as I came to the ship's side, my partner, who was
on board, came out on the quarter-deck, and called to me, with a great
deal of joy, "We have stopped the leak--we have stopped the leak!"--"Say
you so?" said I; "thank God; but weigh anchor, then,
immediately."--"Weigh!" says he; "what do you mean by that?  What is the
matter?"--"Ask no questions," said I; "but set all hands to work, and
weigh without losing a minute."  He was surprised; however, he called the
captain, and he immediately ordered the anchor to be got up; and though
the tide was not quite down, yet a little land-breeze blowing, we stood
out to sea.  Then I called him into the cabin, and told him the story;
and we called in the men, and they told us the rest of it; but as it took
up a great deal of time, before we had done a seaman comes to the cabin
door, and called out to us that the captain bade him tell us we were
chased by five sloops, or boats, full of men.  "Very well," said I, "then
it is apparent there is something in it."  I then ordered all our men to
be called up, and told them there was a design to seize the ship, and
take us for pirates, and asked them if they would stand by us, and by one
another; the men answered cheerfully, one and all, that they would live
and die with us.  Then I asked the captain what way he thought best for
us to manage a fight with them; for resist them I was resolved we would,
and that to the last drop.  He said readily, that the way was to keep
them off with our great shot as long as we could, and then to use our
small arms, to keep them from boarding us; but when neither of these
would do any longer, we would retire to our close quarters, for perhaps
they had not materials to break open our bulkheads, or get in upon us.

The gunner had in the meantime orders to bring two guns, to bear fore and
aft, out of the steerage, to clear the deck, and load them with musket-
bullets, and small pieces of old iron, and what came next to hand.  Thus
we made ready for fight; but all this while we kept out to sea, with wind
enough, and could see the boats at a distance, being five large
longboats, following us with all the sail they could make.

Two of those boats (which by our glasses we could see were English)
outsailed the rest, were near two leagues ahead of them, and gained upon
us considerably, so that we found they would come up with us; upon which
we fired a gun without ball, to intimate that they should bring to: and
we put out a flag of truce, as a signal for parley: but they came
crowding after us till within shot, when we took in our white flag, they
having made no answer to it, and hung out a red flag, and fired at them
with a shot.  Notwithstanding this, they came on till they were near
enough to call to them with a speaking-trumpet, bidding them keep off at
their peril.

It was all one; they crowded after us, and endeavoured to come under our
stern, so as to board us on our quarter; upon which, seeing they were
resolute for mischief, and depended upon the strength that followed them,
I ordered to bring the ship to, so that they lay upon our broadside; when
immediately we fired five guns at them, one of which had been levelled so
true as to carry away the stern of the hindermost boat, and we then
forced them to take down their sail, and to run all to the head of the
boat, to keep her from sinking; so she lay by, and had enough of it; but
seeing the foremost boat crowd on after us, we made ready to fire at her
in particular.  While this was doing one of the three boats that followed
made up to the boat which we had disabled, to relieve her, and we could
see her take out the men.  We then called again to the foremost boat, and
offered a truce, to parley again, and to know what her business was with
us; but had no answer, only she crowded close under our stern.  Upon
this, our gunner who was a very dexterous fellow ran out his two case-
guns, and fired again at her, but the shot missing, the men in the boat
shouted, waved their caps, and came on.  The gunner, getting quickly
ready again, fired among them a second time, one shot of which, though it
missed the boat itself, yet fell in among the men, and we could easily
see did a great deal of mischief among them.  We now wore the ship again,
and brought our quarter to bear upon them, and firing three guns more, we
found the boat was almost split to pieces; in particular, her rudder and
a piece of her stern were shot quite away; so they handed her sail
immediately, and were in great disorder.  To complete their misfortune,
our gunner let fly two guns at them again; where he hit them we could not
tell, but we found the boat was sinking, and some of the men already in
the water: upon this, I immediately manned out our pinnace, with orders
to pick up some of the men if they could, and save them from drowning,
and immediately come on board ship with them, because we saw the rest of
the boats began to come up.  Our men in the pinnace followed their
orders, and took up three men, one of whom was just drowning, and it was
a good while before we could recover him.  As soon as they were on board
we crowded all the sail we could make, and stood farther out to the sea;
and we found that when the other boats came up to the first, they gave
over their chase.

Being thus delivered from a danger which, though I knew not the reason of
it, yet seemed to be much greater than I apprehended, I resolved that we
should change our course, and not let any one know whither we were going;
so we stood out to sea eastward, quite out of the course of all European
ships, whether they were bound to China or anywhere else, within the
commerce of the European nations.  When we were at sea we began to
consult with the two seamen, and inquire what the meaning of all this
should be; and the Dutchman confirmed the gunner's story about the false
sale of the ship and of the murder of the captain, and also how that he,
this Dutchman, and four more got into the woods, where they wandered
about a great while, till at length he made his escape, and swam off to a
Dutch ship, which was sailing near the shore in its way from China.

He then told us that he went to Batavia, where two of the seamen
belonging to the ship arrived, having deserted the rest in their travels,
and gave an account that the fellow who had run away with the ship, sold
her at Bengal to a set of pirates, who were gone a-cruising in her, and
that they had already taken an English ship and two Dutch ships very
richly laden.  This latter part we found to concern us directly, though
we knew it to be false; yet, as my partner said, very justly, if we had
fallen into their hands, and they had had such a prepossession against us
beforehand, it had been in vain for us to have defended ourselves, or to
hope for any good quarter at their hands; especially considering that our
accusers had been our judges, and that we could have expected nothing
from them but what rage would have dictated, and an ungoverned passion
have executed.  Therefore it was his opinion we should go directly back
to Bengal, from whence we came, without putting in at any port
whatever--because where we could give a good account of ourselves, could
prove where we were when the ship put in, of whom we bought her, and the
like; and what was more than all the rest, if we were put upon the
necessity of bringing it before the proper judges, we should be sure to
have some justice, and not to be hanged first and judged afterwards.

I was some time of my partner's opinion; but after a little more serious
thinking, I told him I thought it was a very great hazard for us to
attempt returning to Bengal, for that we were on the wrong side of the
Straits of Malacca, and that if the alarm was given, we should be sure to
be waylaid on every side--that if we should be taken, as it were, running
away, we should even condemn ourselves, and there would want no more
evidence to destroy us.  I also asked the English sailor's opinion, who
said he was of my mind, and that we certainly should be taken.  This
danger a little startled my partner and all the ship's company, and we
immediately resolved to go away to the coast of Tonquin, and so on to the
coast of China--and pursuing the first design as to trade, find some way
or other to dispose of the ship, and come back in some of the vessels of
the country such as we could get.  This was approved of as the best
method for our security, and accordingly we steered away NNE., keeping
above fifty leagues off from the usual course to the eastward.  This,
however, put us to some inconvenience: for, first, the winds, when we
came that distance from the shore, seemed to be more steadily against us,
blowing almost trade, as we call it, from the E. and ENE., so that we
were a long while upon our voyage, and we were but ill provided with
victuals for so long a run; and what was still worse, there was some
danger that those English and Dutch ships whose boats pursued us, whereof
some were bound that way, might have got in before us, and if not, some
other ship bound to China might have information of us from them, and
pursue us with the same vigour.

I must confess I was now very uneasy, and thought myself, including the
late escape from the longboats, to have been in the most dangerous
condition that ever I was in through my past life; for whatever ill
circumstances I had been in, I was never pursued for a thief before; nor
had I ever done anything that merited the name of dishonest or
fraudulent, much less thievish.  I had chiefly been my own enemy, or, as
I may rightly say, I had been nobody's enemy but my own; but now I was
woefully embarrassed: for though I was perfectly innocent, I was in no
condition to make that innocence appear; and if I had been taken, it had
been under a supposed guilt of the worst kind.  This made me very anxious
to make an escape, though which way to do it I knew not, or what port or
place we could go to.  My partner endeavoured to encourage me by
describing the several ports of that coast, and told me he would put in
on the coast of Cochin China, or the bay of Tonquin, intending afterwards
to go to Macao, where a great many European families resided, and
particularly the missionary priests, who usually went thither in order to
their going forward to China.

Hither then we resolved to go; and, accordingly, though after a tedious
course, and very much straitened for provisions, we came within sight of
the coast very early in the morning; and upon reflection on the past
circumstances of danger we were in, we resolved to put into a small
river, which, however, had depth enough of water for us, and to see if we
could, either overland or by the ship's pinnace, come to know what ships
were in any port thereabouts.  This happy step was, indeed, our
deliverance: for though we did not immediately see any European ships in
the bay of Tonquin, yet the next morning there came into the bay two
Dutch ships; and a third without any colours spread out, but which we
believed to be a Dutchman, passed by at about two leagues' distance,
steering for the coast of China; and in the afternoon went by two English
ships steering the same course; and thus we thought we saw ourselves
beset with enemies both one way and the other.  The place we were in was
wild and barbarous, the people thieves by occupation; and though it is
true we had not much to seek of them, and, except getting a few
provisions, cared not how little we had to do with them, yet it was with
much difficulty that we kept ourselves from being insulted by them
several ways.  We were in a small river of this country, within a few
leagues of its utmost limits northward; and by our boat we coasted north-
east to the point of land which opens the great bay of Tonquin; and it
was in this beating up along the shore that we discovered we were
surrounded with enemies.  The people we were among were the most
barbarous of all the inhabitants of the coast; and among other customs
they have this one: that if any vessel has the misfortune to be
shipwrecked upon their coast, they make the men all prisoners or slaves;
and it was not long before we found a spice of their kindness this way,
on the occasion following.

I have observed above that our ship sprung a leak at sea, and that we
could not find it out; and it happened that, as I have said, it was
stopped unexpectedly, on the eve of our being pursued by the Dutch and
English ships in the bay of Siam; yet, as we did not find the ship so
perfectly tight and sound as we desired, we resolved while we were at
this place to lay her on shore, and clean her bottom, and, if possible,
to find out where the leaks were.  Accordingly, having lightened the
ship, and brought all our guns and other movables to one side, we tried
to bring her down, that we might come at her bottom; but, on second
thoughts, we did not care to lay her on dry ground, neither could we find
out a proper place for it.




CHAPTER XII--THE CARPENTER'S WHIMSICAL CONTRIVANCE


The inhabitants came wondering down the shore to look at us; and seeing
the ship lie down on one side in such a manner, and heeling in towards
the shore, and not seeing our men, who were at work on her bottom with
stages, and with their boats on the off-side, they presently concluded
that the ship was cast away, and lay fast on the ground.  On this
supposition they came about us in two or three hours' time with ten or
twelve large boats, having some of them eight, some ten men in a boat,
intending, no doubt, to have come on board and plundered the ship, and if
they found us there, to have carried us away for slaves.

When they came up to the ship, and began to row round her, they
discovered us all hard at work on the outside of the ship's bottom and
side, washing, and graving, and stopping, as every seafaring man knows
how.  They stood for a while gazing at us, and we, who were a little
surprised, could not imagine what their design was; but being willing to
be sure, we took this opportunity to get some of us into the ship, and
others to hand down arms and ammunition to those that were at work, to
defend themselves with if there should be occasion.  And it was no more
than need: for in less than a quarter of an hour's consultation, they
agreed, it seems, that the ship was really a wreck, and that we were all
at work endeavouring to save her, or to save our lives by the help of our
boats; and when we handed our arms into the boat, they concluded, by that
act, that we were endeavouring to save some of our goods.  Upon this,
they took it for granted we all belonged to them, and away they came
directly upon our men, as if it had been in a line-of-battle.

Our men, seeing so many of them, began to be frightened, for we lay but
in an ill posture to fight, and cried out to us to know what they should
do.  I immediately called to the men that worked upon the stages to slip
them down, and get up the side into the ship, and bade those in the boat
to row round and come on board.  The few who were on board worked with
all the strength and hands we had to bring the ship to rights; however,
neither the men upon the stages nor those in the boats could do as they
were ordered before the Cochin Chinese were upon them, when two of their
boats boarded our longboat, and began to lay hold of the men as their
prisoners.

The first man they laid hold of was an English seaman, a stout, strong
fellow, who having a musket in his hand, never offered to fire it, but
laid it down in the boat, like a fool, as I thought; but he understood
his business better than I could teach him, for he grappled the Pagan,
and dragged him by main force out of their boat into ours, where, taking
him by the ears, he beat his head so against the boat's gunnel that the
fellow died in his hands.  In the meantime, a Dutchman, who stood next,
took up the musket, and with the butt-end of it so laid about him, that
he knocked down five of them who attempted_ told him, _That he expected no Quarters from
him, nor should he give him any._

By this time _Black-beard_'s Sloop fleeted, as Mr. _Maynard_'s Sloops were
rowing towards him, which being not above a Foot high in the Waste, and
consequently the Men all exposed, as they came near together, (there being
hitherto little or no Execution done, on either Side,) the Pyrate fired a
Broadside, charged with all Manner of small Shot. ----A fatal Stroke to
them! The Sloop the Lieutenant was in, having twenty Men killed and
wounded, and the other Sloop nine. This could not be help'd, for there
being no Wind, they were oblig'd to keep to their Oars, otherwise the
Pyrate would have got away from him, which, it seems, the Lieutenant was
resolute to prevent.

After this unlucky Blow, _Black-beard_'s Sloop fell Broadside to the Shore;
Mr. _Maynard_'s other Sloop, which was called the _Ranger_, fell a-stern,
being, for the present, disabled; so the Lieutenant finding his own Sloop
had Way, and would soon be on Board of _Teach_, he ordered all his Men
down, for fear of another Broadside, which must have been their
Destruction, and the loss of their Expedition. Mr. _Maynard_ was the only
Person that kept the Deck, except the Man at the Helm, whom he directed to
lye down snug, and the Men in the Hold were ordered to get their Pistols
and their Swords ready for close fighting, and to come up at his Command;
in order to which, two Ladders were placed in the Hatch-Way for the more
Expedition. When the Lieutenant's Sloop boarded the other, Captain
_Teach_'s Men threw in several new fashioned sort of Grenadoes, _viz._ Case
Bottles fill'd with Powder, and small Shot, Slugs, and Pieces of Lead or
Iron, with a quick Match in the Mouth of it, which being lighted without
Side, presently runs into the Bottle to the Powder, and as it is instantly
thrown on Board, generally does great Execution, besides putting all the
Crew into a Confusion; but by good Providence, they had not that Effect
here; the Men being in the Hold, and _Black-beard_ seeing few or no Hands
aboard, told his Men, _That they were all knock'd on the Head, except three
or four; and therefore, says he, let's jump on Board, and cut them to
Pieces._

Whereupon, under the Smoak of one of the Bottles just mentioned,
_Black-beard_ enters with fourteen Men, over the Bows of _Maynard_'s Sloop,
and were not seen by him till the Air cleared; however, he just then gave a
Signal to his Men, who all rose in an Instant, and attack'd the Pyrates
with as much Bravery as ever was done upon such an Occasion: _Black-beard_
and the Lieutenant fired the first Pistol at each other, by which the
Pyrate received a Wound, and then engaged with Swords, till the
Lieutenant's unluckily broke, and stepping back to cock a Pistol,
_Black-beard_, with his Cutlash, was striking at that Instant, that one of
_Maynard_'s Men gave him a terrible Wound in the Neck and Throat, by which
the Lieutenant came off with a small Cut over his Fingers.

They were now closely and warmly engaged, the Lieutenant and twelve Men,
against _Black-beard_ and fourteen, till the Sea was tinctur'd with Blood
round the Vessel; _Black-beard_ received a Shot into his Body from the
Pistol that Lieutenant _Maynard_ discharg'd, yet he stood his Ground, and
fought with great Fury, till he received five and twenty Wounds, and five
of them by Shot. At length, as he was cocking another Pistol, having fired
several before, he fell down dead; by which Time eight more out of the
fourteen dropp'd, and all the rest, much wounded, jump'd over-board, and
call'd out for Quarters, which was granted, tho' it was only prolonging
their Lives for a few Days. The Sloop _Ranger_ came up, and attack'd the
Men that remain'd in _Black-beard_'s Sloop, with equal Bravery, till they
likewise cry'd for Quarters.

Here was an End of that couragious Brute, who might have pass'd in the
World for a Heroe, had he been employ'd in a good Cause; his Destruction,
which was of such Consequence to the Plantations, was entirely owing to the
Conduct and Bravery of Lieutenant _Maynard_ and his Men, who might have
destroy'd him with much less Loss, had they had a Vessel with great Guns;
but they were obliged to use small Vessels, because the Holes and Places he
lurk'd in, would not admit of others of greater Draught; and it was no
small Difficulty for this Gentleman to get to him, having grounded his
Vessel, at least, a hundred times, in getting up the River, besides other
Discouragements, enough to have turn'd back any Gentleman without
Dishonour, who was less resolute and bold than this Lieutenant. The
Broadside that did so much Mischief before they boarded, in all Probability
saved the rest from Destruction; for before that _Teach_ had little or no
Hopes of escaping, and therefore had posted a resolute Fellow, a Negroe
whom he had bred up, with a lighted Match, in the Powder-Room, with
Commands to blow up when he should give him Orders, which was as soon as
the Lieutenant and his Men could have entered, that so he might have
destroy'd his Conquerors: and when the Negro found how it went with
_Black-beard_, he could hardly be perswaded from the rash Action, by two
Prisoners that were then in the Hold of the Sloop.

What seems a little odd, is, that some of these Men, who behaved so bravely
against _Black-beard_, went afterwards a pyrating themselves, and one of
them was taken along with _Roberts_; but I do not find that any of them
were provided for, except one that was hanged; but this is a Digression.

The Lieutenant caused _Black-beard_'s Head to be severed from his Body, and
hung up at the Bolt-sprit End, then he sailed to _Bath-Town_, to get Relief
for his wounded Men.

It must be observed, that in rummaging the Pyrate's Sloop, they found
several Letters and written Papers, which discovered the Correspondence
betwixt Governor _Eden_, the Secretary and Collector, and also some Traders
at _New-York_, and _Black-beard_. It is likely he had Regard enough for his
Friends, to have destroyed these Papers before the Action, in order to
hinder them from falling into such Hands, where the Discovery would be of
no Use, either to the Interest or Reputation of these fine Gentlemen, if it
had not been his fixed Resolution to have blown up together, when he found
no possibility of escaping.

When the Lieutenant came to _Bath-Town_, he made bold to seize in the
Governor's Store-House, the sixty Hogsheads of Sugar, and from honest Mr.
_Knight_, twenty; which it seems was their Dividend of the Plunder taken in
the _French_ Ship; the latter did not long survive this shameful Discovery,
for being apprehensive that he might be called to an Account for these
Trifles, fell sick with the Fright, and died in a few Days.

After the wounded Men were pretty well recover'd, the Lieutenant sailed
back to the Men of War in _James River_, in _Virginia_, with
_Black-beard_'s Head still hanging at the Bolt-sprit End, and fiveteen
Prisoners, thirteen of whom were hanged. It appearing upon Tryal, that one
of them, _viz._ _Samuel Odell_, was taken out of the trading Sloop, but the
Night before the Engagement. This poor Fellow was a little unlucky at his
first entering upon his new Trade, there appearing no less than 70 Wounds
upon him after the Action, notwithstanding which, he lived, and was cured
of them all. The other Person that escaped the Gallows, was one _Israel
Hands_, the Master of _Black-beard_'s Sloop, and formerly Captain of the
same, before the _Queen Ann's Revenge_ was lost in _Topsail_ Inlet.

The aforesaid _Hands_ happened not to be in the Fight, but was taken
afterwards ashore at _Bath-Town_, having been sometime before disabled by
_Black-beard_, in one of his savage Humours, after the following
Manner.--One Night drinking in his Cabin with _Hands_, the Pilot, and
another Man; _Black-beard_ without any Provocation privately draws out a
small Pair of Pistols, and cocks them under the Table, which being
perceived by the Man, he withdrew and went upon Deck, leaving _Hands_, the
Pilot, and the Captain together. When the Pistols were ready, he blew out
the Candle, and crossing his Hands, discharged them at his Company;
_Hands_, the Master, was shot thro' the Knee, and lam'd for Life; the other
Pistol did no Execution. --Being asked the meaning of this, he only
answered, by damning them, that _if he did not now and then kill one of
them, they would forget who he was._

_Hands_ being taken, was try'd and condemned, but just as he was about to
be executed, a Ship arrives at _Virginia_ with a Proclamation for
prolonging the Time of his Majesty's Pardon, to such of the Pyrates as
should surrender by a limited Time therein expressed: Notwithstanding the
Sentence, _Hands_ pleaded the Pardon, and was allowed the Benefit of it,
and is alive at this Time in London, begging his Bread.

Now that we have given some Account of _Teach_'s Life and Actions, it will
not be amiss, that we speak of his Beard, since it did not a little
contribute towards making his Name so terrible in those Parts.

_Plutarch_, and other grave Historians have taken Notice, that several
great Men amongst the _Romans_, took their Sir-Names from certain odd Marks
in their Countenances; as _Cicero_, from a Mark or Vetch on his Nose; so
our Heroe, Captain _Teach_, assumed the Cognomen of _Black-beard_, from
that large Quantity of Hair, which, like a frightful Meteor, covered his
whole Face, and frightened _America_ more than any Comet that has appeared
there a long Time.

This Beard was black, which he suffered to grow of an extravagant Length;
as to Breadth, it came up to his Eyes; he was accustomed to twist it with
Ribbons, in small Tails, after the Manner of our Ramilies Wiggs, and turn
them about his Ears: In Time of Action, he wore a Sling over his Shoulders,
with three brace of Pistols, hanging in Holsters like Bandaliers; and stuck
lighted Matches under his Hat, which appearing on each Side of his Face,
his Eyes naturally looking fierce and wild, made him altogether such a
Figure, that Imagination cannot form an Idea of a Fury, from Hell, to look
more frightful.

If he had the look of a Fury, his Humours and Passions were suitable to it;
we shall relate two or three more of his Extravagancies, which we omitted
in the Body of his History, by which it will appear, to what a Pitch of
Wickedness, human Nature may arrive, if it's Passions are not checked.

In the Commonwealth of Pyrates, he who goes the greatest Length of
Wickedness, is looked upon with a kind of Envy amongst them, as a Person of
a more extraordinary Gallantry, and is thereby entitled to be distinguished
by some Post, and if such a one has but Courage, he must certainly be a
great Man. The Hero of whom we are writing, was thoroughly accomplished
this Way, and some of his Frolicks of Wickedness, were so extravagant, as
if he aimed at making his Men believe he was a Devil incarnate; for being
one Day at Sea, and a little flushed with drink:--_Come_, says he, _let us
make a Hell of our own, and try how long we can bear it_; accordingly he,
with two or three others, went down into the Hold, and closing up all the
Hatches, filled several Pots full of Brimstone, and other combustible
Matter, and set it on Fire, and so continued till they were almost
suffocated, when some of the Men cried out for Air; at length he opened the
Hatches, not a little pleased that he held out the longest.

The Night before he was killed, he set up and drank till the Morning, with
some of his own Men, and the Master of a Merchant-Man, and having had
Intelligence of the two Sloops coming to attack him, as has been before
observed; one of his Men asked him, in Case any thing should happen to him
in the Engagement with the Sloops, whether his Wife knew where he had
buried his Money? He answered, _That no Body but himself and the Devil,
knew where it was, and the longest Liver should take all._

Those of his Crew who were taken alive, told a Story which may appear a
little incredible; however, we think it will not be fair to omit it, since
we had it from their own Mouths. That once upon a Cruize, they found out
that they had a Man on Board more than their Crew; such a one was seen
several Days amongst them, sometimes below, and sometimes upon Deck, yet no
Man in the Ship could give an Account who he was, or from whence he came;
but that he disappeared little before they were cast away in their great
Ship, but, it seems, they verily believed it was the Devil.

One would think these Things should induce them to reform their Lives, but
so many Reprobates together, encouraged and spirited one another up in
their Wickedness, to which a continual Course of drinking did not a little
contribute; for in _Black-beard_'s Journal, which was taken, there were
several Memorandums of the following Nature, sound writ with his own
Hand.-- _Such a Day, Rum all out:--Our Company somewhat sober:--A damn'd
Confusion amongst us!--Rogues a plotting;--great Talk of Separation.--So I
look'd sharp for a Prize;--such a Day took one, with a great deal of Liquor
on Board, so kept the Company hot, damned hot, then all Things went well
again._

Thus it was these Wretches passed their Lives, with very little Pleasure or
Satisfaction, in the Possession of what they violently take away from
others, and sure to pay for it at last, by an ignominious Death.

The Names of the Pyrates killed in the Engagement, are as follow.

There were in the Pyrate Sloops, and ashore in a Tent, near where the
Sloops lay, 25 Hogsheads of Sugar, 11 Teirces, and 145 Bags of Cocoa, a
Barrel of Indigo, and a Bale of Cotton; which, with what was taken from the
Governor and Secretary, and the Sale of the Sloop, came to 2500 _l._
besides the Rewards paid by the Governor of _Virginia_, pursuant to his
Proclamation; all which was divided among the Companies of the two Ships,
_Lime_ and _Pearl_, that lay in _James_ River; the brave Fellows that took
them coming in for no more than their Dividend amongst the rest, and was
paid it within these three Months.

CHAP. IV. OF Major _Stede Bonnet_, And his CREW.

THE Major was a Gentleman of good Reputation in the Island of
_Barbadoes_, was Master of a plentiful Fortune, and had the Advantage of a
liberal Education. He had the least Temptation of any Man to follow such a
Course of Life, from the Condition of his Circumstances. It was very
surprizing to every one, to hear of the Major's Enterprize, in the Island
were he liv'd; and as he was generally esteem'd and honoured, before he
broke out into open Acts of Pyracy, so he was afterwards rather pitty'd
than condemned, by those that were acquainted with him, believing that this
Humour of going a pyrating, proceeded from a Disorder in his Mind, which
had been but too visible in him, some Time before this wicked Undertaking;
and which is said to have been occasioned by some Discomforts he found in a
married State; be that as it will, the Major was but ill qualify'd for the
Business, as not understanding maritime Affairs.

However, he fitted out a Sloop with ten Guns and 70 Men, entirely at his
own Expence, and in the Night-Time sailed from _Barbadoes_. He called his
Sloop the _Revenge_; his first Cruize was off the Capes of _Virginia_,
where he took several Ships, and plundered them of their Provisions,
Cloaths, Money, Ammunition, _&c._ in particular the _Anne_, Captain
_Montgomery_, from _Glascow_; the _Turbet_ from _Barbadoes_, which for
Country sake, after they had taken out the principal Part of the Lading,
the Pyrate Crew set her on Fire; the _Endeavour_, Captain _Scot_, from
_Bristol_, and the _Young_ from _Leith_. From hence they went to
_New-York_, and off the East End of _Long-Island_, took a Sloop bound for
the _West-Indies_, after which they stood in and landed some Men at
_Gardner_'s _Island_, but in a peaceable Manner, and bought Provisions for
the Company's Use, which they paid for, and so went off again without
Molestation.

Some Time after, which was in _August_ 1717, _Bonnet_ came off the Bar of
_South-Carolina_, and took a Sloop and a Brigantine bound in; the Sloop
belonged to _Barbadoes, Joseph Palmer_ Master, laden with Rum, Sugar and
Negroes; and the Brigantine came from _New-England, Thomas Porter_ Master,
whom they plundered, and then dismiss'd; but they sailed away with the
Sloop, and at an Inlet in _North-Carolina_ careened by her, and then set
her on Fire.

After the Sloop had cleaned, they put to Sea, but came to no Resolution
what Course to take; the Crew were divided in their Opinions, some being
for one Thing, and some another, so that nothing but Confusion seem'd to
attend all their Schemes.

The Major was no Sailor as was said before, and therefore had been obliged
to yield to many Things that were imposed on him, during their Undertaking,
for want of a competent Knowledge in maritime Affairs; at length happening
to fall in Company with another Pyrate, one _Edward Teach_, (who for his
remarkable black ugly Beard, was more commonly called _Black-Beard_:) This
Fellow was a good Sailor, but a most cruel hardened Villain, bold and
daring to the last Degree, and would not stick at the perpetrating the most
abominable Wickedness imaginable; for which he was made Chief of that
execrable Gang, that it might be said that his Post was not unduly filled,
_Black-beard_ being truly the Superior in Roguery, of all the Company, as
has been already related.

To him _Bonnet_'s Crew joined in Consortship, and _Bonnet_ himself was laid
aside, notwithstanding the Sloop was his own; he went aboard
_Black-beard_'s Ship, not concerning himself with any of their Affairs,
where he continued till she was lost in _Topsail_ Inlet, and one _Richards_
was appointed Captain in his Room. The Major now saw his Folly, but could
not help himself, which made him Melancholy; he reflected upon his past
Course of Life, and was confounded with Shame, when he thought upon what he
had done: His Behaviour was taken Notice of by the other Pyrates, who liked
him never the better for it; and he often declared to some of them, that he
would gladly leave off that Way of Living, being fully tired of it; but he
should be ashamed to see the Face of any _English_ Man again; therefore if
he could get to _Spain_ or _Portugal_, where he might be undiscovered, he
would spend the Remainder of his Days in either of those Countries,
otherwise he must continue with them as long as he lived.

When _Black-beard_ lost his Ship at _Topsail_ Inlet, and surrendered to the
King's Proclamation, _Bonnet_ reassumed the Command of his own Sloop,
_Revenge_, goes directly away to _Bath-Town_ in _North-Carolina_,
surrenders likewise to the King's Pardon, and receives a Certificate. The
War was now broke out between the _Tripple_ Allies and _Spain_; so Major
_Bonnet_ gets a Clearence for his Sloop at _North-Carlina_, to go to the
Island of St. _Thomas_, with a Design (at least it was pretended so) to get
the Emperor's Commission, to go a Privateering upon the _Spaniards_. When
_Bonnet_ came back to _Topsail_ Inlet, he found that _Teach_ and his Gang
were gone, and that they had taken all the Money, small Arms and Effects of
Value out of the great Ship, and set ashore on a small sandy Island above a
League from the Main, seventeen Men, no doubt with a Design they should
perish, there being no Inhabitant, or Provisions to subsist withal, nor any
Boat or Materials to build or make any kind of Launch or Vessel, to escape
from that desolate Place: They remained there two Nights and one Day,
without Subsistance, or the least Prospect of any, expecting nothing else
but a lingering Death; when to their inexpressable Comfort, they saw
Redemption at Hand; for Major _Bonnet_ happening to get Intelligence of
their being there, by two of the Pyrates who had escaped _Teach_'s Cruelty,
and had got to a poor little Village at the upper End of the Harbour, sent
his Boat to make Discovery of the Truth of the Matter, which the poor
Wretches seeing, made a signal to them, and they were all brought on Board
_Bonnet_'s Sloop.

Major _Bonnet_ told all his Company, that he would take a Commission to go
against the _Spaniards_, and to that End, was going to St. _Thomas_'s
therefore if they would go with him, they should be welcome; whereupon they
all consented, but as the Sloop was preparing to sail, a Bom-Boat, that
brought Apples and Sider to sell to the Sloop's Men, informed them, that
Captain _Teach_ lay at _Ocricock_ Inlet, with only 18 or 20 Hands.
_Bonnet_, who bore him a mortal Hatred for some Insults offered him, went
immediately in pursuit of _Black-beard_, but it happened too late, for he
missed of him there, and after four Days Cruize, hearing no farther News of
him, they steered their Course towards _Virginia_.

In the Month of _July_, these Adventurers came off the Capes, and meeting
with a Pink with a Stock of Provisions on Board, which they happened to be
in Want of, they took out of her ten or twelve Barrels of Pork, and about
400 Weight of Bread; but because they would not have this set down to the
Account of Pyracy, they gave them eight or ten Casks of Rice, and an old
Cable, in lieu thereof.

Two Days afterwards they chased a Sloop of sixty Ton, and took her two
Leagues off of Cape _Henry_; they were so happy here as to get a Supply of
Liquor to their Victuals, for they brought from her two Hogsheads of Rum,
and as many of Molosses, which, it seems, they had need of, tho' they had
not ready Money to purchase them: What Security they intended to give, I
can't tell, but _Bonnet_ sent eight Men to take Care of the Prize Sloop,
who, perhaps, not caring to make Use of those accustom'd Freedoms, took the
first Opportunity to go off with her, and _Bonnet_ (who was pleased to have
himself called Captain _Thomas_,) saw them no more.

After this, the Major threw off all Restraint, and though he had just
before received his Majesty's Mercy, in the Name of _Stede Bonnet_, he
relaps'd in good Earnest into his old Vocation, by the Name of Captain
_Thomas_, and recommenced a down-right Pyrate, by taking and plundering all
the Vessels he met with: He took off Cape _Henry_, two Ships from
_Virginia_, bound to _Glascow_, out of which they had very little besides
an hundred Weight of Tobacco. The next Day they took a small Sloop bound
from _Virginia_ to _Bermudas_, which supply'd them with twenty Barrels of
Pork, some Bacon, and they gave her in return, two Barrels of Rice, and a
Hogshead of Molossus; out of this Sloop two Men enter'd voluntarily. The
next they took was another _Virginia_ Man, bound to _Glascow_, out of which
they had nothing of Value, save only a few Combs, Pins and Needles, and
gave her instead thereof, a Barrel of Pork, and two Barrels of Bread.

From _Virginia_ they sailed to _Philadelphia_, and in the Latitude of 38
North, they took a Scooner, coming from _North-Carolina_, bound to
_Boston_, they had out of her only two Dozen of Calf-Skins, to make Covers
for Guns, and two of their Hands, and detained her some Days. All this was
but small Game, and seem'd as if they design'd only to make Provision for
their Sloop against they arrived at St. _Thomas_'s; for they hitherto had
dealt favourably with all that were so unhappy as so fall into their Hands;
but those that came after, fared not so well, for in the Latitude of 32,
off of _Delaware_ River, near _Philadelphia_, they took two Snows bound to
_Bristol_, out of whom they got some Money, besides Goods, perhaps to the
Value of 150 Pounds; at the same Time they took a Sloop of sixty Tons bound
from _Philadelphia_ to _Barbadoes_, which after taking some Goods out, they
dismissed along with the Snows.

The 29th Day of _July_, Captain _Thomas_ took a Sloop of 50 Tons, six or
seven Leagues off _Delaware_ Bay, bound from _Philadelphia_ to _Barbadoes,
Thomas Read_ Master, loaden with Provisions, which they kept, and put four
or five of their Hands on Board her. The last Day of _July_, they took
another Sloop of 60 Tons, commanded by _Peter Manwaring_, bound from
_Antegoa_ to _Philadelphia_, which they likewise kept with all the Cargo,
consisting chiefly of Rum, Molosses, Sugar, Cotton, Indigo, and about 25
Pound in Money, valued in all to 500 Pound.

The last Day of _July_, our Rovers with the Vessels last taken, left
_Delaware_ Bay, and sailed to Cape _Fear_ River, where they staid too long
for their Safety, for the Pyrate Sloop which they now new named the _Royal
James_, proved very leaky, so that they were obliged to remain here almost
two Months, to refit and repair their Vessel: They took in this River a
small Shallop, which they ripped up to mend the Sloop, and retarded the
further Prosecution of their Voyage, as before mentioned, till the News
came to _Carolina_, of a Pyrate Sloop's being there to carreen with her
Prizes.

Upon this Information, the Council of _South-Carolina_ was alarmed, and
apprehended they should receive another Visit from them speedily; to
prevent which, Colonel _William Rhet_, of the same Province, waited on the
Governor, and generously offered himself to go with two Sloops to attack
this Pyrate; which the Governor readily accepted, and accordingly gave the
Colonel a Commission and full Power, to fit such Vessels as he thought
proper for the Design.

In a few Days two Sloops were equipped and manned: The _Henry_ with 8 Guns
and 70 Men, commanded by Captain _John Masters_, and the _Sea Nymph_, with
8 Guns and 60 Men, commanded by Captain _Fayrer Hall_, both under the
entire Direction and Command of the aforesaid Colonel _Rhet_, who, on the
14th of _September_, went on Board the _Henry_, and, with the other Sloop,
sailed from _Charles-Town_ to _Swillivants_ Island, to put themselves in
order for the Cruize. Just then arrived a small Ship from _Antigoa_, one
_Cock_ Master, with an Account, that in Sight of the Bar he was taken and
plundered by one _Charles Vane_, a Pyrate, in a Brigantine of 12 Guns and
90 Men; and who had also taken two other Vessels bound in there, one a
small Sloop, Captain _Dill_ Master, from _Barbadoes_; the other a
Brigantine, Captain _Thompson_ Master, from _Guiney_, with ninety odd
Negroes, which they took out of the Vessel, and put on Board another Sloop
then under the Command of one _Yeats_, his Consort, with 25 Men. This
prov'd fortunate to the Owners of the _Guiney_ Man, for _Yeats_ having
often attempted to quit this Course of Life, took an Opportunity in the
Night, to leave _Vane_ and to run into _North-Edisto_ River, to the
Southward of _Charles-Town_, and surrendered to his Majesty's Pardon. The
Owners got their Negroes, and _Yeats_ and his Men had Certificates given
them from the Government.

_Vane_ cruised some Time off the Bar, in hopes to catch _Yeats_, and
unfortunately for them, took two Ships coming out, bound to _London_, and
while the Prisoners were aboard, some of the Pyrates gave out, that they
designed to go into one of the Rivers to the Southward. Colonel _Rhet_,
upon hearing this, sailed over the Bar the 15th of _September_, with the
two Sloops before mentioned; and having the Wind Northerly, went after the
Pyrate _Vane_, and scoured the Rivers and Inlets to the Southward; but not
meeting with him, tacked and stood for Cape _Fear_ River, in Prosecution of
his first Design. On the 26th following, in the Evening, the Colonel with
his small Squadron, entered the River, and saw, over a Point of Land, three
Sloops at an Anchor, which were Major _Bonnet_ and his Prizes; but it
happened that in going up the River, the Pilot run the Colonel's Sloops
aground, and it was dark before they were on Float, which hindered their
getting up that Night. The Pyrates soon discovered the Sloops, but not
knowing who they were, or upon what Design they came into that River, they
manned three Canoes, and sent them down to take them, but they quickly
found their Mistake, and returned to the Sloop, with the unwelcome News.
Major _Bonnet_ made Preparations that Night for engaging, and took all the
Men out of the Prizes. He shewed Captain _Manwaring_, one of his Prisoners,
a Letter, he had just wrote, which he declared he would send to the
Governor of _Carolina_; the Letter was to this Effect, _viz. That if the
Sloops, which then appeared, were sent out against him, by the said
Governor, and he should get clear off, that he would burn and destroy all
Ships or Vessels going in or coming out of_ South-Carolina. The next
Morning they got under Sail, and came down the River, designing only a
running Fight. Colonel _Rhet_'s Sloops got likewise under Sail, and stood
for him, getting upon each Quarter of the Pyrate, with Intent to board him;
which he perceiving, edged in towards the Shore, and being warmly engaged,
their Sloop ran a-ground: The _Carolina_ Sloops being in the same shoal
Water, were in the same Circumstances; the _Henry_, in which Colonel _Rhet_
was, grounded within Pistol shot of the Pyrate, and on his Bow; the other
Sloop grounded right a-head of him, and almost out of Gun-Shot, which made
her of little Service to the Colonel, while they lay a-ground.

At this Time the Pyrate had a considerable Advantage; for their Sloop,
after she was a-ground, listed from Colonel _Rhet_'s, by which Means they
were all covered, and the Colonel's Sloop listing the same Way, his Men
were much exposed; notwithstanding which, they kept a brisk Fire the whole
Time they lay thus a-ground, which was near five Hours. The Pyrates made a
Wiff in their bloody Flag, and beckoned several Times with their Hats in
Derision to the Colonel's Men, to come on Board, which they answered with
chearful Huzza's, and said, _that they would speak with them by and by_;
which accordingly happened, for the Colonel's Sloop being first a float, he
got into deeper Water, and after mending the Sloop's Rigging, which was
much shattered in the Engagement, they stood for the Pyrate, to give the
finishing Stroke, and designed to go directly on Board him; which he
prevented, by sending a Flag of Truce, and after some Time capitulating,
they surrendered themselves Prisoners. The Colonel took Possession of the
Sloop, and was extreamly pleased to find that Captain _Thomas_, who
commanded her, was the individual Person of Major _Stede Bonnet_, who had
done them the Honour several Times to visit their own Coast of _Carolina_.

There were killed in this Action, on Board the _Henry_, ten Men, and
fourteen wounded; on Board the _Sea Nymph_, two killed and four wounded.
The Officers and Sailors in both Sloops behaved themselves with the
greatest Bravery; and had not the Sloops so unluckily run a-ground, they
had taken the Pyrate with much less loss of Men; but as he designed to get
by them, and so make a running Fight, the _Carolina_ Sloops were obliged to
keep near him, to prevent his getting away. Of the Pyrates there were seven
killed and five wounded, two of which died soon after of their Wounds.
Colonel _Rhet_ weigh'd the 30th of _September_, from Cape _Fear_ River, and
arrived at _Charles-Town_ the 3d of _October_, to the great Joy of the
whole Province of _Carolina_.

_Bonnet_ and his Crew, two Days after, were put ashore, and there not being
a publick Prison, the Pyrates were kept at the Watch-House, under a Guard
of Militia; but Major _Bonnet_ was committed into the Custody of the
Marshal, at his House; and in a few Days after, _David Hariot_ the Master,
and _Ignatius Pell_ the Boatswain, who were designed for Evidences against
the other Pyrates, were removed from the rest of the Crew, to the said
Marshal's House, and every Night two Centinals set about the said House;
but whether thro' any Corruption, or want of Care in guarding the
Prisoners, I can't say; but on the 24th of _October_, the Major and
_Hariot_ made their Escape, the Boatswain refusing to go along with them.
This made a great Noise in the Province, and People were open in their
Resentments, often reflecting on the Governor, and others in the
Magistracy, as tho' they had been brib'd, for conniving at their Escape.
These Invectives arose from their Fears, that _Bonnet_ would be capable of
raising another Company, and prosecute his Revenge against this Country,
for what he had lately, tho' justly, suffered: But they were in a short
Time made easy in those Respects; for as soon as the Governor had the
Account of _Bonnet_'s Escape, he immediately issued out a Proclamation, and
promised a Reward of 700 Pounds to any that would take him, and sent
several Boats with armed Men, both to the Northward and Southward, in
pursuit of him.

_Bonnet_ stood to the Northward, in a small Vessel, but wanting
Necessaries, and the Weather being bad, he was forced back, and so return'd
with his Canoe, to _Swillivants_ Island, near _Charles-Town_, to fetch
Supplies; but there being some Information sent to the Governor, he sent
for Colonel _Rhet_, and desired him to go in pursuit of _Bonnet_; and
accordingly gave him a Commission for that Purpose: Wherefore the Colonel,
with proper Craft, and some Men, went away that Night for _Swillivant_'s
Island, and, after a very diligent Search, discovered _Bonnet_ and _Hariot_
together; the Colonel's Men fired upon them, and killed _Hariot_ upon the
Spot, and wounded one Negro and an _Indian. Bonnet_ submitted, and
surrender'd himself; and the next Morning, being _November_ the 6th, was
brought by Colonel _Rhet_ to _Charles-Town_, and, by the Governor's
Warrant, was committed into safe Custody, in order for his being brought to
his Tryal.

On the 28th of _October_, 1718, a Court of Vice-Admiralty was held at
_Charles-Town_, in _South-Carolina_, and, by several Adjournments,
continued to _Wednesday_, the 12th of _November_ following, for the Tryal
of the Pyrates taken in a Sloop formerly called _the Revenge_, but
afterwards _the Royal James_, before _Nicholas Trot_, Esq; Judge of the
Vice-Admiralty, and Chief Justice of the said Province of _South-Carolina_,
and other Assistant Judges.

The King's Commission to Judge _Trot_ was read, and a Grand Jury sworn, for
the finding of the several Bills, and a learned Charge given them by the
said Judge, wherein he 1st shewed, _That the Sea was given by God, for the
Use of Men, and is Subject to Dominion and Property, as well as the Land_.

2dly, He particularly remark'd to them, _the Sovereignty of the King of_
England _over the_ British _Seas_.

3dly, He observed, _that as Commerce and Navigation could not be carried on
without Laws; so there have been always particular Laws, for the better
ordering and regulating marine Affairs_; with an historical Account or
those Laws, and Origine.

4thly, He proceeded to shew, _that there have been particular Courts and
Judges appointed; to whose Jurisdiction maritime Causes do belong, and that
in Matters both Civil and Criminal_.

And then 5thly, He particularly shewed them, _the Constitution and
Jurisdiction of that Court of Admiralty Sessions_.

And lastly, _the Crimes cognizable therein_; and particularly enlarged
_upon the Crime of Pyracy_, which was then brought before them.

The Indictments being found, a petit Jury was sworn, and the following
Persons arraigned and tried.

                                * * *

and received Sentence of Death.

They were most of them try'd upon two Indictments, as follows.

                                * * *

T_HE Jurors for our Sovereign Lord the King, do upon their Oath
present, that_ Stede Bonnet, _late of_ Barbadoes, _Mariner_, Robert Tucker,
&c. &c. _The_ 2_d Day of_ August, _in the fifth Year of the Reign of our
Sovereign Lord_ George, &c. _By Force of Arms upon the High-Sea, in a
certain Place called Cape_ James, &c. _did pyratically, and felloniously
set upon, break,_ _board, and enter, a certain Merchant Sloop, called the_
Frances, Peter Manwaring _Commander, by Force_, &c. _upon the High-Sea, in
a certain Place, called Cape_ James, alias _Cape_ Inlopen, _about two Miles
distant from the Shore, in the Lattitude of_ 39, _or thereabouts; and
within the Jurisdiction of the Court of Vice-Admiralty, of_ South-Carolina,
_being a Sloop of certain Persons_, (_to the Jurors, unknown_) _and then,
and there, pyratically, and felloniously did make an Assault, in, and upon
the said_ Peter Manwaring, _and others his Mariners_, (_whose Names to the
Jurors aforesaid, are unknown,) in the same Sloop, against the Peace of
God, and of our said now Sovereign Lord the King, then, and there being,
pyratically and felloniously, did put the aforesaid_ Peter Manwaring, _and
others, his Mariners, of the same Sloop, in the Sloop aforesaid, then
being, in corporal Fear of their Lives, then and there, in the Sloop
aforesaid, upon the_ High-Sea, _in the Place aforesaid, called Cape_ James,
alias _Cape_ Inlopen, _about two Miles from the Shore, in the Lattitude of_
39, _or thereabouts, as aforesaid, and within the Jurisdiction aforesaid;
pyratically, and felloniously, did steal, take, and carry away the said
Merchant Sloop, called the_ Frances, _and also twenty six Hogsheads_, &c.
&c. &c. _being found in the aforesaid Sloop, in the Custody and Possession
of the said_ Peter Manwaring, _and others, his Mariners of the said Sloop,
and from their Custody and Possession, then and there, upon the High-Sea
aforesaid, called Cape_ James, alias _Cape_ Inlopen, _as aforesaid, and
within the Jurisdiction aforesaid, against the Peace of our now Sovereign
Lord the King, his Crown and Dignity_.

This was the Form of the Indictments they were arraigned upon, and tho'
they might have proved several more Facts upon the major Part of the Crew,
the Court thought fit to prosecute but two; the other was for seizing in a
pyratical and felonious Manner, the Sloop _Fortune, Thomas Read_ Commander;
which Indictment running in the same Form with the above-mentioned, it will
be unnecessary to say more of it.

All the Prisoners arraigned, pleaded Not Guilty, and put themselves upon
their Tryals, except _James Wilson_, and _John Levit_, who pleaded Guilty
to both Indictments, and _Daniel Perry_, to one only. The Major would have
gone through both the Indictments at once, which the Court not admitting,
he pleaded Not Guilty to both Indictments, but being convicted of one, he
retracted his former Plea to the second Indictment, and pleaded Guilty to
it.

The Prisoners made little or no Defence, every one pretending only that
they were taken off a Maroon Shore, and were shipped with Major _Bonnet_ to
go to St. _Thomas_'s; but being out at Sea, and wanting Provisions, they
were obliged to do what they did by others; and so did Major _Bonnet_
himself, pretend that 'twas Force, not Inclination, that occasioned what
had happened. However, the Facts being plainly proved, and that they had
all shared ten or eleven Pounds a Man, excepting the three last, and
_Thomas Nichols_, they were all but they, found Guilty. The Judge made a
very grave Speech to them, setting forth _the Enormity of their Crimes, the
Condition they were now in, and the Nature and Necessity of an unfeigned
Repentance_; and then recommended them to the Ministers of the Province,
for more ample Directions, to fit them for Eternity, _for_ (concluded he)
_the Priest's Lips shall keep Knowledge, and you shall seek the Law at
their Mouths; for they are the Messengers of the Lord_. Mat. II. 57. _And
the Ambassadors of Christ, and unto them is committed the Word_ [or
Doctrine] _of Reconciliation_, 2 Cor. V. 19. 20. And then pronounced
Sentence of Death upon them.

On _Saturday November_ the 8th, 1711. _Robert Tucker, Edward Robinson, Neal
Paterson, William Scot, Job Bayley, John-William Smith, John Thomas,
William Morrison, Samuel Booth, William Hewit, William Eddy_, alias _Neddy,
Alexander Annand, George Ross, George Dunkin, Matthew King, Daniel Perry,
Henry Virgin, James Robbins, James Mullet_, alias _Millet, Thomas Price,
John Lopez_, and _Zachariah Long_, were executed at the _White-Point_ near
_Charles-Town_, pursuant to their Sentence.

As for the Captain, his Escape protracted his Fate, and spun out his Life a
few Days longer, for he was try'd the 10th, and being found Guilty,
received Sentence in like Manner as the former; before which Judge _Trot_,
made a most excellent Speech to him, rather somewhat too long to be taken
into our History, yet I could not tell how to pass by so good and useful a
Piece of Instruction, not knowing whose Hands this Book may happen to fall
into.

_The Lord Chief Justices's_ SPEECH, _upon his pronouncing Sentence on
Major_ STEDE BONNET.

MAjor _Stede Bonnet_, you stand here convicted upon two Indictments
of Pyracy; one by the Verdict of the Jury, and the other by your own
Confession.

Altho' you were indicted but for _two_ Facts, yet you know that at your
Tryal it was fully proved even by an unwilling Witness, that you
_pyratically_ took and rifled no less than _thirteen_ Vessels, since you
sail'd from _North-Carolina_.

So that you might have been indicted, and convicted of _eleven_ more Acts
of _Pyracy_, since you took the Benefit of the King's _Act of Grace_, and
pretended to leave that wicked Course of Life.

Not to mention the many _Acts_ of _Pyracy_ you committed before; for which
if your Pardon from _Man_ was never so authentick, yet you must expect to
answer for them before God.

You know that the Crimes you have committed are _evil_ in themselves, and
contrary to the _Light_ and _Law_ of _Nature_, as well as the _Law_ of God,
by which you are commanded that _you shall not steal_, Exod. 20. 15. And
the Apostle St. _Paul_ expresly affirms, That _Thieves shall not inherit
the Kingdom of God_, 1 Cor. 6. 10.

But to _Theft_ you have added a greater Sin, which is _Murder_. How many
you may have _killed_ of those that resisted you in the committing your
former _Pyracies_, I know not: But this we all know, That besides the
Wounded, you kill'd no less than _eighteen_ Persons out of those that were
sent by lawful Authority to suppress you, and put a Stop to those Rapines
that you daily acted.

And however you may fancy that that was killing Men fairly in open _Fight_,
yet this know, that the Power of the _Sword_ not being committed into your
Hands by any lawful Authority, you were not impowered to use any _Force_,
or _fight_ any one; and therefore those Persons that fell in that Action,
in doing their Duty to their King and Country, were _murdered_, and their
_Blood_ now cries out for _Vengeance_ and _Justice_ against you: For it is
the _Voice of Nature_, confirmed by the _Law_ of God, That _whosoever
sheddeth Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed_. Gen. 9. 6.

And consider that Death is not the only Punishment due to _Murderers_; for
they are threatened to have _their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire
and Brimstone, which is the second Death_, Rev. 21. 8. See _Chap._ 22. 15.
Words which carry that Terror with them, that considering your
Circumstances and your Guilt, surely the Sound of them must make you
tremble; _For who can dwell with everlasting Burnings?_ Chap. 33. 14.

As the _Testimony_ of your _Conscience_ must convince you of the great and
many Evils you have committed, by which you have highly offended God, and
provoked most justly his Wrath and Indignation against you, so I suppose I
need not tell you that the only Way of obtaining Pardon and Remission of
your Sins from God, is by a true and unfeigned _Repentance_ and _Faith_ in
Christ, by whose meritorious Death and Passion, you can only hope for
Salvation.

You being a Gentleman that have had the Advantage of a _liberal Education_,
and being generally esteemed a Man of _Letters_, I believe it will be
needless for me to explain to you the Nature of _Repentance_ and _Faith_ in
Christ, they being so fully and so often mentioned in the Scriptures, that
you cannot but know them. And therefore, perhaps, for that Reason it might
be thought by some improper for me to have said so much to you, as I have
already upon this Occasion; neither should I have done it, but that
considering the Course of your Life and Actions, I have just Reason to
fear, that the Principles of Religion that had been instilled into you by
your _Education_, have been at least corrupted, if not entirely defaced, by
the _Scepticism_ and _Infidelity_ of this wicked Age; and that what Time
you allowed for Study, was rather applied to the _Polite Literature_, and
the vain _Philosophy_ of the Times, than a serious Search after the _Law_
and _Will_ of God, as revealed unto us in the Holy _Scriptures_: For _had
your Delight been in the Law of the Lord, and that you had meditated
therein Day and Night_, Psal. 1. 2. you would then have found that God's
_Word was a Lamp unto your Feet, and a Light to your Path_, Psal. 119. 105.
and that you would account all other Knowledge but _Loss_, in Comparison of
_the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus_, Phil. 3. 8. _who to them
that are called is the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God_, 1 Cor. 1. 24.
_even the hidden Wisdom which God ordained before the World_, Chap. 2. 7.

You would then have esteemed the _Scriptures_ as the _Great Charter_ of
Heaven, and which delivered to us not only the most perfect _Laws_ and
_Rules_ of Life, but also discovered to us the Acts of _Pardon_ from God,
wherein they have offended those righteous Laws: For in them only is to be
found the great _Mystery_ of fallen Man's _Redemption, which the Angels
desire to look into_, 1 Pet. 1. 12.

And they would have taught you that _Sin_ is the debasing of _Human
Nature_, as being a _Derivation_ from that _Purity, Rectitude_, and
_Holiness_, in which God created us, and that _Virtue_ and _Religion_, and
walking by the Laws of God, were altogether preferable to the Ways of _Sin_
and _Satan_; for that the _Ways_ of Virtue are _Ways of Pleasantness, and
all their Paths are Peace_, Prov. 3. 17.

But what you could not learn from God's Word, by reason of your
_carelesly_, or but _superficially_ considering the same, I hope the Course
of his _Providence_, and the present _Afflictions_ that he hath laid upon
you, hath now convinced you of the same: For however in your seeming
Prosperity you might make a _Mock at your Sins_ Prov. 3. 17. yet now that
you see that God's Hand hath reached you, and brought you to publick
Justice, I hope your present unhappy Circumstances hath made you seriously
reflect upon your past Actions and Course of Life; and that you are now
sensible of the Greatness of your Sins, and that you find the Burden of
them is intolerable.

And that therefore being thus _labouring, and heavy laden with Sin_, Mat.
11. 28. you will esteem that as the most valuable _Knowledge_, that can
shew you how you can be reconciled to that Supreme God that you have so
highly offended; and that can reveal to you Him who is not only the
powerful _Advocate with the Father for you_, 1 John 2. 1. but also who hath
paid that Debt that is due for your Sins by his own Death upon the Cross
for you; and thereby made full Satisfaction for the Justice of God. And
this is to be found no where but in God's Word, which discovers to us that
_Lamb of God which takes away the Sins of the World_, John 1. 29. which is
_Christ_ the Son of God: For this know, and be assured, _that there is none
other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby we must be saved_, Acts 4.
12. but only by the Name of the Lord _Jesus_.

But then consider how he invites all Sinners to come unto him, and, _that
he will give them rest_, Matt. 11. 28. for he assures us, _that he came to
seek and to t of Holland       }

You, _James Skyrm, Michael Lemmon, Robert Hartley_, &c.

Y_E, and every one of you, are in the Name, and by the Authority, of
our dread Sovereign Lord_, George, _King of_ Great Britain, _indicted as
follows_;

_Forasmuch as in open Contempt of the Laws of your Country, ye have all of
you been wickedly united, and articled together, for the Annoyance and
Disturbance of his Majesty's trading Subjects by Sea. And have in
Conformity to the most evil and mischievous Intentions, been twice down the
Coast of_ Africa, _with two Ships; once in the Beginning of_ August, _and a
second Time, in_ January _last, sinking, burning, or robbing such Ships,
and Vessels, as then happened in your Way._

_Particularly, ye stand charged at the Instance, and Information of
Captain_ Chaloner Ogle, _as Traytors and Pyrates, for the unlawful
Opposition ye made to his Majesty's Ship, the_ Swallow, _under his
Command._

_For that on the_ 5_th of_ February _last past, upon Sight of the aforesaid
King's Ship, ye did immediately weigh Anchor from under Cape_ Lopez, _on
the Southern Coast of_ Africa, _in a_ French _built Ship of_ 32 _Guns,
called the_ Ranger, _and did pursue and chase the aforesaid King's Ship,
with such Dispatch and Precipitancy, as declared ye common Robbers and
Pyrates._

_That about Ten of the Clock the same Morning, drawing within Gun-shot of
his Majesty's aforesaid Ship the_ Swallow, _ye hoisted a pyratical black
Flag, and fired several chace Guns, to deter, as much as ye were able, his
Majesty's Servants from their Duty._

_That an Hour after this, being very nigh to the aforesaid King's Ship, ye
did audaciously continue in a hostile Defence and Assault, for about two
Hours more, in open Violation of the Laws, and in Defiance to the King's
Colours and Commission._

_And lastly, that in the acting, and compassing of all this, ye were all,
and every one of you, in a wicked Combination, voluntarily to exert, and
actually did, in your several Stations, use your utmost Endeavours to
distress the said King's Ship, and murder his Majesty's good Subjects._

To which they severally pleaded, _Not Guilty._

                                * * *

Then the Court called for the Officers of the _Swallow_, Mr. _Isaac Sun_,
Lieutenant, _Ralph Baldrick_, Boatswain, _Daniel Maclauglin_, Mate,
desiring them to view the Prisoners, whether they knew them? And to give an
Account in what Manner they had attack'd and fought the King's Ship; and
they agreed as follows.

That they had viewed all the Prisoners, as they stood now before the Court,
and were assured they were the same taken out of one, or other, of the
Pyrate Ships, _Royal Fortune_, or _Ranger_; but verily believe them to be
taken out of the _Ranger._

That they did in the King's Ship, at break of Day, on _Monday_, the 5th of
_February_, 1721-2, discover three Ships at Anchor, under Cape _Lopez_, on
the Southern Coast of _Africa_; the Cape bearing then W. S. W. about three
Leagues, and perceiving one of them to have a Pendant flying, and having
heard their Morning-Gun before, they immediately suspected them to be
_Roberts_ the Pyrate, his consort, and a _French_ Ship, they knew had been
lately carried out of _Whydah_ Road.

The King's Ship was obliged to hawl off N. W. and W. N. W. to avoid a Sand,
called, the _French Man's Bank_, the Wind then at S. S. E. and found in
half an Hour's time, one of the three had got under Sail from the Careen,
and was bending her Sails, in a Chace towards them. To encourage this
Rashness and Precipitancy, they kept away before the Wind, (as though
afraid,) but with their Tacks on Board, their Main-Yard braced, and making,
at the same Time, very bad Steerage.

About half an Hour after Ten, in the Morning, the Pyrate Ship came within
Gun-shot, and fired four Chace Guns, hoisted a black Flag at the
Mizen-Peek, and got their Sprit-sail Yard under their Bowsprit, for
boarding. In half an Hour more, approaching still nigher, they Starboarded
their Helm, and gave her a Broadside, the Pyrate bringing to, and returning
the same.

After this, the Deponents say, their Fire grew slack for some Time, because
the Pyrate was shot so far a Head on the Weather-Bow, that few of their
Guns could Point to her; yet in this Interval their black Flag was either
Shot away, or hawled down a little Space, and hoisted again.

At length, by their ill Steerage, and Favour of the Wind, they came near, a
second Time; and about Two in the Afternoon shot away their Main-topmast.

The Colours they fought under, besides a black Flag, were a red _English_
Ensign, a King's Jack, and a _Dutch_ Pendant, which they struck at, or
about, Three in the Afternoon, and called for Quarters; it proving to be a
_French_ built Ship of 32 Guns, called the _Ranger._

_Isaac Sun_, _Ralph Baldrick_, _Daniel Maclauglin._

When the Evidence had been heard, the Prisoners were called upon to answer,
how they came on Board this Pyrate Ship; and their Reason for so audacious
a Resistance, as had been made against the King's Ship.

To this, each, in his Reply, owned himself to be one of those taken out of
the _Ranger_; that he had signed their pyratical Articles, and shared in
their Plunder, some few only accepted, who had been there too short a Time.
But that neither in this signing, or sharing, nor in the Resistance had
been made against his Majesty's Ship, had they been Voluntiers, but had
acted in these several Parts, from a Terror of Death; which a Law amongst
them, was to be the Portion of those who refused. The Court then ask'd, who
made those Laws? How those Guns came to be fired? Or why they had not
deserted their Stations, and mutinied, when so fair a Prospect of
Redemption offered? They replied still, with the same Answers, and could
extenuate their Crimes, with no other Plea, than being forced Men.
Wherefore the Court were of Opinion, that the Indictment, as it charged
them with an unlawful Attack and Resistance of the King's Ship, was
sufficiently proved; but then it being undeniably evident, that many of
these Prisoners had been forced, and some of them of very short standing,
they did, on mature Deliberation, come to this merciful Resolution;

That they would hear further Evidence for, or against, each Person singly,
in Relation to those Parts of the Indictment, which declared them
Voluntiers, or charged them with aiding and assisting, at the burning,
sinking, or robbing of other Ships; for if they acted, or assisted, in any
Robberies or Devastations, it would be a Conviction they were Voluntiers;
here such Evidence, though it might want the Form, still carried the Reason
of the Law with it.

out of the _Royal Fortune._

You, _Harry Glasby, William Davison, William Champnies, Samuel
Morwell_, &c.

Y_E, and every one of you, are, in the Name, and by the Authority of
our most dread Sovereign Lord_ George, _King of_ Great Britain, _indicted
as follows._

_Forasmuch as in open Contempt and Violation of the Laws of your Country,
to which ye ought to have been subject_, _ye have all of you been wickedly
united and articled together, for the Annoyance and Destruction of his
Majesty's trading Subjects by Sea; and in Conformity to so wicked an
Agreement and Association, ye have been twice lately down this Coast of_
Africa, _once in_ August, _and a second Time in_ January _last, spoiling
and destroying many Goods and Vessels of his Majesty's Subjects, and other
trading Nations._

_Particularly ye stand indicted at the Information and Instance of Captain_
Chaloner Ogle, _as Traytors, Robbers, Pyrates, and common Enemies to
Mankind._

_For that on the_ 10_th of_ February _last, in a Ship ye were possess'd of
called the_ Royal Fortune, _of_ 40 _Guns, ye did maintain a hostile Defence
and Resistance for some Hours, against his Majesty's Ship the_ Swallow,
_nigh Cape_ Lopez _Bay, on the Southern Coast of_ Africa.

_That this Fight and insolent Resistance against the King's Ship, was made,
not only without any Pretence of Authority, more than that of your own
private depraved Wills, but was done also under a black Flag, flagrantly by
that, denoting your selves common Robbers and Traitors, Opposers and
Violators of the Laws._

_And lastly, that in this Resistance, ye were all of you Voluntiers, and
did, as such, contribute your utmost Efforts, for disabling and distressing
the aforesaid King's Ship, and deterring his Majesty's Servants therein,
from their Duty._

To which they severally pleaded, _Not Guilty._

                                * * *

Whereupon the Officers of his Majesty's Ship, the _Swallow_, were called
again, and testified as follows.

That they had seen all the Prisoners now before the Court, and knew them to
be the same which were taken out of one or other of the Pyrate Ships,
_Royal Fortune_ or _Ranger_, and verily believe them to be those taken out
of the _Royal Fortune._

That the Prisoners were possess'd of a Ship of 40 Guns, called the _Royal
Fortune_, and were at an Anchor under Cape _Lopez_, on the Coast of
_Africa_, with two others: When his Majesty's Ship the _Swallow_, (to which
the Deponents belong'd, and were Officers,) stood in for the Place, on
_Saturday_ the 10th of _February_ 1721-2: The largest had a Jack, Ensign
and Pendant flying, (being this _Royal Fortune_,) who on Sight of them, had
their Boats passing and repassing, from the other two, which they supposed
to be with Men: The Wind not favouring the aforesaid King's Ship, she was
obliged to make two Trips to gain nigh enough the Wind, to fetch in with
the Pyrates; and being at length little more than random Shot from them,
they found she slipped her Cable, and got under Sail.

At Eleven, the Pyrate was within Pistol-Shot, a Breast of them, with a
black Flag, and Pendant hoisted at their Main-topmast Head. The Deponents
say, they then struck the _French_ Ensign that had continued hoisted at
their Staff all the Morning till then; and display'd the King's Colours,
giving her, at the same Time, their Broadside, which was immediately
returned.

The Pyrate's Mizen-topmast fell, and some of her Rigging was torn, yet she
still out sailed the Man of War, and slid half Gun-Shot from them, while
they continued to fire without Intermission, and the other to return such
Guns as could be brought to bear, till by favour of the Winds, they were
advanced very nigh again; and after exchanging a few more Shot, about half
an Hour past one, his Main-Mast came down, having received a Shot a little
below the Parrel.

At Two she struck her Colours, and called for Quarters, proving to be a
Ship, formerly call'd the _Onslow_, but by them, the _Royal Fortune_; and
the Prisoners from her, assured them, that the smallest Ship of the two,
then remaining in the Road, belong'd to them, by the Name of the _Little
Ranger_, which they had deserted on this Occasion.

_Isaac Sun_, _Ralph Baldrick_, _Daniel Maclaughlin._

The Prisoners were asked by the Court, to the same Purpose the others had
been in the Morning; what Exception they had to make against what had been
sworn? And what they had to say in their Defence? And their Reply were much
the same with the other Prisoners; that they were forc'd Men, had not fired
a Gun in this Resistance against the _Swallow_, and that what little
Assistance they did give on this Occasion, was to the Sails and Rigging, to
comply with the arbitrary Commands of _Roberts_, who had threaten'd, and
they were perswaded would, have Shot them on Refusal.

The Court, to dispense equal Justice, mercifully resolved for these, as
they had done for the other Pyrate Crew; that further Evidence should be
heard against each Man singly, to the two Points, of being a Voluntier at
first, and to their particular Acts of Pyracy and Robbery since: That so
Men, who had been lately received amongst them, and as yet, had not been at
the taking, or plundering, of any Ship, might have the Opportunity, and
Benefit, of clearing their Innocence, and not fall promiscuously with the
Guilty.

_By Order of the Court_, John Atkins, _Register._

_Wm. Magnes, Tho. Oughterlauney, Wm. Main, Wm. Mackintosh, Val. Ashplant,
John Walden, Israel Hind, Marcus Johnson, Wm. Petty, Wm. Fernon, Abraham
Harper, Wm. Wood, Tho. How, John Stephenson, Ch. Bunce_, and _John Griffin_

Against these it was deposed by Captain _Joseph Trahern_, and _George
Fenn_, his Mate, that they were all of them, either at the attacking and
taking of the Ship King _Solomon_, or afterwards at the robbing and
plundering of her, and in this Manner; That on the 6th of _January_ last
their Ship riding at Anchor near Cape _Appollonia_ in _Africa_, discovered
a Boat rowing towards them, against Wind and Stream, from a Ship that lay
about three Miles to Leeward. They judged from the Number of Men in her, as
she nearer advanced, to be a Pyrate, and made some Preparation for
receiving her, believing, on a nigher View, they would think fit to
withdraw from an Attack that must be on their Side with great Disadvantage
in an open Boat, and against double the Number of Men; yet by the Rashness,
and the Pusillanimity of his own People (who laid down their Arms, and
immediately called for Quarter) the Ship was taken, and afterwards robbed
by them.

_President._ Can you charge your Memory with any Particulars in the Seizure
and Robbery?

_Evidence._ We know that _Magnes_, Quarter-Master of the Pyrate Ship,
commanded the Men in this Boat that took us, and assumed the Authority of
ordering her Provisions and Stores out, which being of different Kinds, we
soon found, were seized and sent away under more particular Directions; for
_Main_, as Boatswain of the Pyrate Ship, carried away two Cables, and
several Coils of Rope, as what belonged to his Province, beating some of
our own Men for not being brisk enough at working in the Robbery. _Petty_,
as Sail-maker, saw to the Sails and Canvas; _Harper_, as Cooper to the Cask
and Tools; _Griffin_, to the Carpenter's Stores, and _Oughterlauney_, as
Pilot, having shifted himself with a Suit of my Clothes, a new tye Wig, and
called for a Bottle of Wine, ordered the Ship, very arrogantly, to be
steered under Commadore _Robert_'s Stern, (I suppose to know what Orders
there were concerning her.) So far particularly. In the general, Sir, they
were very outragious and emulous in Mischief.

_President._ Mr. _Castel_, acquaint the Court of what you know in Relation
to this Robbery of the King _Solomon_; after what Manner the Pyrate-Boat
was dispatch'd for this Attempt.

_Tho. Castel._ I was a Prisoner, Sir, with the Pyrates when their Boat was
ordered upon that Service, and found, upon a Resolution of going, Word was
passed through the Company, Who would go? And I saw all that did, did it
voluntarily; no Compulsion, but rather pressing who should be foremost.

The Prisoners yielded to what had been sworn about the Attack and Robbery,
but denied the latter Evidence, saying, _Roberts_ hector'd, and upbraided
them of Cowardice on this very Occasion; and told some, they were very
ready to step on Board of a Prize when within Command of the Ship, but now
there seem'd to be a Tryal of their Valour, backward and fearful.

_President._ So that _Roberts_ forc'd ye upon this Attack.

_Prisoners. Roberts_ commanded us into the Boat, and the Quarter-Master to
rob the Ship; neither of whose Commands we dared to have refused.

_President._ And granting it so, those are still your own Acts, since done
by Orders from Officers of your own Election. Why would Men, honestly
disposed, give their Votes for such a Captain and such a Quarter-Master as
were every Day commanding them on distastful Services?

Here succeeded a Silence among the Prisoners, but at length _Fernon_ very
honestly own'd, that he did not give his Vote to _Magnes_, but to _David
Sympson_ (the old Quarter-Master,) _for in Truth_, says he, _I took_ Magnes
_for too honest a Man, and unfit for the Business._

The Evidence was plain and home, and the Court, without any Hesitation,
brought them in _Guilty._

W_ILLIAM Church, Phil. Haak, James White, Nich. Brattle, Hugh Riddle,
William Thomas, Tho. Roberts, Jo. Richards, Jo. Cane, R. Wood, R. Scot, Wm.
Davison, Sam. Morwell, Edward Evans, Wm. Guineys_, and 18 _French_ Men.

The four first of these Prisoners, it was evident to the Court, served as
Musick on Board the Pyrate, were forced lately from the several Merchant
Ships they belonged to; and that they had, during this Confinement, an
uneasy Life of it, having sometimes their Fiddles, and often their Heads
broke, only for excusing themselves, or saying they were tired, when any
Fellow took it in his Head to demand a Tune.

The other _English_ had been a very few Days on Board the Pyrate, only from
_Whydah_ to Cape _Lopez_, and no Capture or Robbery done by them in that
Time. And the _French_ Men were brought with a Design to reconduct their
own Ship (or the _Little Ranger_ in Exchange) to _Whydah_ Road again, and
were used like Prisoners; neither quarter'd nor suffered to carry Arms. So
that the Court immediately acquiesced in, _Acquitting them._

T_HO. Sutton, David Sympson, Christopher Moody, Phil. Bill, R. Hardy,
Hen. Dennis, David Rice, Wm. Williams, R. Harris, Geo. Smith, Ed. Watts,
Jo. Mitchell_ and _James Barrow._

The Evidence against these Prisoners, were _Geret de Haen_, Master of the
_Flushingham_, taken nigh _Axim_, the Beginning of _January_ last.

_Benj. Kreft_ Master, and _James Groet_ Mate of the _Gertruycht_, taken
nigh _Gabone_ in _December_ last, and Mr. _Castel, Wingfield_ and others,
that had been Prisoners with the Pyrates.

The former deposed, that all these Prisoners (excepting _Hardy_) were on
Board at the Robbery and Plunder of their Ships, behaving in a vile
outragious Manner, putting them in bodily Fears, sometimes for the Ship,
and sometimes for themselves; and in particular, _Kreft_ charged it on
_Sutton_, that he had ordered all their Gunner's Stores out; on which that
Prisoner presently interrupted, and said, he was perjured, _That he had not
taken half._ A Reply, I believe, not designed as any sawcy Way of jesting,
but to give their Behaviour an Appearance of more Humanity than the _Dutch_
would allow.

From Mr. _Castel, Wingfield_ and others, they were proved to be
distinguished Men, Men who were consulted as Chiefs in all Enterprizes;
belonged most of them to the House of Lords, (as they call'd it,) and could
carry an Authority over others. The former said, particularly of _Hardy_,
(Quarter-Master of the _Ranger_,) that when the _Diligence_ Sloop was
taken, (whereto he belonged,) none was busier in the Plunder, and was the
very Man who scuttled and sunk that Vessel.

From some of the Prisoners acquitted, it was farther demanded, whether the
Acceptance or Refusal of any Office was not in their own Option? And it was
declared, that every Officer was chose by a Majority of Votes, and might
refuse, if he pleased, since others gladly embraced what brought with it an
additional Share of Prize. _Guilty_

                                * * *

The Court on the 31st of _March_, remanded the following six before them,
for Sentence, _viz. Dav. Sympson, Wm. Magnes, R. Hardy, Thomas Sutton,
Christopher Moody_, and _Valen. Ashplant._

To whom the President spoke to the following Purpose; _The Crime of Pyracy,
of which all of ye have been justly convicted, is of all other Robberies
the most aggravating and inhumane, in that being removed from the Fears of
Surprize, in remote and distant Parts, ye do in Wantonness of Power often
add Cruelty to Theft._

_Pyrates unmoved at Distress or Poverty, not only spoil and rob, but do it
from Men needy, and who are purchasing their Livlihoods thro' Hazards and
Difficulties, which ought rather to move Compassion; and what is still
worse, do often, by Perswasion or Force, engage the inconsiderate Part of
them, to their own and Families Ruin, removing them from their Wives and
Children, and by that, from the Means that should support them from Misery
and Want._

_To a trading Nation, nothing can be so Destructive as Pyracy, or call for
more exemplary Punishment; besides, the national Reflection it infers: It
cuts off the Returns of Industry, and those plentiful Importations that
alone can make an Island flourishing; and it is your Aggravation, that ye
have been the Chiefs and Rulers in these licentious and lawless Practices._

_However, contrary to the Measures ye have dealt, ye have been heard with
Patience, and tho' little has, or possibly could, have been said in Excuse
or Extenuation of your Crimes, yet Charity makes us hope that a true and
sincere Repentance_ (_which we heartily recommend_) _may entitle ye to
Mercy and Forgiveness, after the Sentence of the Law has taken Place, which
now remains upon me to pronounce._

Y_OU_ Dav. Simpson, William Magnes, R. Hardy, Tho. Sutton,
Christopher Moody, _and_ Val. Ashplant.

_Ye, and each of you, are adjudged and sentenced, to be carried back to the
Place from whence ye came, from thence to the Place of Execution, without
the Gates of this Castle, and there within the Flood-Marks, to be hanged by
the Neck till ye are dead._

_After this, ye, and each of you shall be taken down, and your Bodies
hanged in Chains._

Warrant for Execution.

P_URSUANT to the Sentence given on_ Saturday, _by the Court of
Admiralty, at_ Cape-Corso-Castle, _against_ Dav. Simpson, Wm. Magnes, R.
Hardy, Tho. Sutton, Christopher Moody, _and_ Valentine Ashplant.

_You are hereby directed to carry the aforesaid Malefactors to the Place of
Execution, without the Gates of this Castle, to Morrow Morning at Nine of
the Clock, and there within the Flood-Marks, cause them to be hanged by the
Neck till they are dead, for which, this shall be your Warrant. Given under
my Hand, this_ 2_d Day of_ April 1722.

_To_ Joseph Gordyn, _Provost-Marshal._

Mungo Heardman.

_The Bodies remove in Chains, to the Gibbets already erected on the
adjacent Hillocks._

_William Phillips._

IT appeared by the Evidence of Captain _Jo. Trahern_, and _George
Fenn_, Mate of the King _Solomon_, that this Prisoner was Boatswain of the
same Ship, when she was attacked and taken off Cape _Appollonia_, the 6th
of _January_ last, by the Pyrate's Boat.

When the Boat drew nigh, (they say,) it was judged from the Number of Men
in her, that they were Pyrates, and being hailed, answered, _Defiance_; at
which the Commander snatched a Musquet from one of his Men, and fired,
asking them at the same Time, whether they would stand by him, to defend
the Ship? But the Pyrates returning a Volley, and crying out, they would
give no Quarters if any Resistance was made; this Prisoner took upon him to
call out for Quarters, without the Master's Consent, and mislead the rest
to the laying down their Arms, and giving up the Ship, to half the Number
of Men, and in an open Boat. It was further evident he became, after this,
a Voluntier amongst them. First, because he was presently very forward and
brisk, in robbing the Ship _King Solomon_, of her Provisions and Stores.
Secondly, because he endeavoured to have his Captain ill used; and lastly,
because he had confessed to _Fenn_, that he had been obliged to sign their
Articles that Night, (a Pistol being laid on the Table, to signify he must
do it, or be shot,) when the whole appeared to be an Untruth from other
Evidence, who also asserted his being armed in the Action against the
_Swallow._

In answer to this, he first observed upon the Unhappiness of being
friendless in this Part of the World, which, elsewhere, by witnessing to
the Honesty of his former Life, would, he believed, in a great Measure,
have invalidated the wrong Evidence had been given of his being a Voluntier
with the Pyrates. He owns indeed, he made no Application to his Captain, to
intercede for a Discharge, but excuses it with saying, he had a dislike to
him, and therefore was sure that such Application would have avail'd him
nothing.

The Court observed the Pretences of this, and other of the Pyrates, of a
Pistol and their Articles being served up in a Dish together, or of their
being misused and forced from an honest Service, was often a Complotment of
the Parties, to render them less suspected of those they came from, and was
to answer the End of being put in a News-Paper or Affidavit: and the
Pyrates were so generous as not to refuse a Compliment to a Brother that
cost them nothing, and, at the same Time, secured them the best Hands; the
best I call them, because such a Dependance made them act more boldly.
_Guilty._

_Harry Glasby_, Master.

THere appearing several Persons in Court, who had been taken by
_Roberts_'s Ship, whereof the Prisoner was Master, their Evidence was
accepted as follows.

_Jo. Trahern_, Commander of the _King Solomon_, deposed, the Prisoner,
indeed, to act as Master of the Pyrate Ship (while he was under Restraint
there) but was observed like no Master, every one obeying at Discretion, of
which he had taken Notice, and complained to him, how hard a Condition it
was, to be a Chief among Brutes; and that he was weary of his Life, and
such other Expressions, (now out of his Memory,) as shew'd in him a great
Disinclination to that Course of Living.

_Jo. Wingfield_, a Prisoner with them at _Calabar_, says the same, as to
the Quality he acted in, but that he was Civil beyond any of them, and
verily believes, that when the Brigantine he served on Board of, as a
Factor for the _African_ Company, was voted to be burnt, this Man was the
Instrument of preventing it, expressing himself with a great deal of
Sorrow, for this and the like malicious Rogueries of the Company he was in;
that to him shewed, he had acted with Reluctancy, as one who could not
avoid what he did. He adds further, that when one _Hamilton_, a Surgeon,
was taken by them, and the Articles about to be imposed on him, he opposed,
and prevented it. And that _Hunter_, another Surgeon, among them, was
cleared at the Prisoner's Instance and Perswasion; from which last, this
Deponent had it assured to him, that _Glasby_ had once been under Sentence
of Death, on Board of them, with two more, for endeavouring an Escape in
the _West-Indies_, and that the other two were really shot for it.

_Elizabeth Trengrove_, who was taken a Passenger in the _African_ Company's
Ship _Onslow_, strengthen'd the Evidence of the last Witness; for having
heard a good Character of this _Glasby_, she enquired of the
Quarter-Master, who was then on Board a robbing, whether or no she could
see him? And he told her, _No_; they never ventured him from the Ship, for
he had once endeavoured his Escape, and they had ever since continued
jealous of him.

_Edward Crisp_, Captain _Trengrove_, and Captain _Sharp_, who had all been
taken in their Turns, acknowledge for themselves and others, who had
unluckily fallen into those Pyrates Hands, that the good Usage they had met
with, was chiefly thro' the Prisoner's Means, who often interposed, for
leaving sufficient Stores and Instruments on Board the Ships they had
robbed, alledging, they were superfluous and unnecessary there.

_James White_, whose Business was Musick, and was on the Poop of the Pyrate
Ship in Time of Action with the _Swallow_, deposed, that during the
Engagement, and Defence she made, he never saw the Prisoner busied about
the Guns, or giving Orders, either to the loading or firing of them; but
that he wholly attended to the setting, or trimming, of the Sails, as
_Roberts_ commanded; and that in the Conclusion, he verily believed him to
be the Man who prevented the Ship's being blown up, by setting trusty
Centinels below, and opposing himself against such hot-headed Fellows as
had procured lighted Matches, and were going down for that Purpose.

_Isaac Sun_, Lieutenant of the Man of War, deposed, that when he came to
take Possession of the Prize, in the King's Boat, he found the Pyrates in a
very distracted and divided Condition; some being for blowing up, and
others (who perhaps supposed themselves least culpable) opposing it: That
in this Confusion he enquired for the Prisoner, of whom he had before heard
a good Character; and thinks he rendered all the Service in his Power, for
preventing it; in particular, he understood by all Hands, that he had
seized, and taken, from one _James Philips_, a lighted Match, at the
Instant he was going down to the Magazine, swearing, that he should send
them all to H--l together. He had heard also, that after _Roberts_ was
killed, the Prisoner ordered the Colours to be struck; and had since shown,
how opposite his Practice and Principles had been, by discovering who were
the greatest Rogues among them.

The Prisoner, in his own Defence, says, when he had the Misfortune of
falling into the Pyrates Hands, he was chief Mate of the _Samuel_, of
_London_, Captain _Cary_; and when he had hid himself, to prevent the
Design of carrying him away, they found him, and beat and threw him
over-board. Seven Days afterwards, upon his objecting against, and refusing
to sign their Articles, he was cut and abus'd again: That tho' after this
he ingratiated himself, by a more humble Carriage, it was only to make Life
easy; the Shares they had given him, having been from Time to Time returned
again to such Prisoners as fell in his Way; till of late, indeed, he had
made a small Reservation, and had desired Captain _Loan_ to take two or
three Moidores from him, to carry to his Wife. He was once taken, he says,
at making his Escape, in the _West-Indies_, and, with two more, sentenced
to be shot for it, by a drunken Jury; the latter actually suffered, and he
was preserved only by one of the chief Pyrates taking a sudden Liking to
him, and bullying the others. A second time he ran away at _Hispaniola_,
carrying a Pocket Compass, for conducting him through the Woods; but that
being a most desolate and wild Part of the Island he fell upon, and he
ignorant how to direct his Course, was obliged, after two or three Days
wandering, to return towards the Ship again, denying with egregious Oaths,
the Design he was charg'd with, for Fear they should shoot him. From this
Time he hopes it will be some Extenuation of his Fault, that most of the
acquitted Prisoners can witness, they entertained Jealousies of him, and
_Roberts_ would not admit him into his Secrets; and withal, that Captain
_Cary_, (and four other Passengers with him) had made Affidavit of his
having been forced from his Employ, which tho' he could not produce, yet he
humbly hoped the Court would think highly probable from the Circumstances
offered.

On the whole, the Court was of Opinion Artists had the best Pretension to
the Plea of Force, from the Necessity Pyrates are sometimes under of
engaging such, and that many Parts of his own Defence had been confirmed by
the Evidence, who had asserted he acted with Reluctance, and had expressed
a Concern and Trouble for the little Hopes remained to him, of extricating
himself. That he had used all Prisoners (as they were called) well, at the
hazard of ill Usage to himself. That he had not in any military Capacity
assisted their Robberies. That he had twice endeavoured his Escape, with
the utmost Danger. _Acquitted him._

Captain _James Skyrm._

IT appeared from the Evidence of several Prisoners acquitted, that
this _Skyrm_ commanded the _Ranger_, in that Defence she made against the
King's Ship; that he ordered the Men to their Quarters, and the Guns to be
loaded and fired, having a Sword in his Hand, to enforce those Commands;
and beat such to their Duty whom he espied any way negligent or backward.
That altho' he had lost a Leg in the Action, his Temper was so warm, as to
refuse going off the Deck, till he found all was lost.

In his Defence, he says, he was forced from a Mate's Employ on Board a
Sloop call'd the _Greyhound_, of St. _Christophers, Oct._ 1720. The Pyrate
having drubbed him, and broke his Head, only for offering to go away when
that Sloop was dismissed. Custom and Success had since indeed blunted, and,
in some Measure, worn out the Sense of Shame; but that he had really for
several Months past been sick, and disqualified for any Duty, and though
_Roberts_ had forced him on this Expedition much against his Will, yet the
Evidence must be sensible, the Title of Captain gave him no Pre-eminence,
for he could not be obeyed, though he had often called to them, to leave
off their Fire, when he perceived it to be the King's Ship.

The Sickness he alledged, but more especially the Circumstance of losing
his Leg, were Aggravations of his Fault, shewing him more alert on such
Occasions, than he was now willing to be thought: As to the Name of
Captain, if it were allowed to give him no Precedence out of Battle, yet
here it was proved a Title of Authority; such an Authority as could direct
an Engagement against the King's Colours, and therefore he was in the
highest Degree, _Guilty._

_John Walden._

CAptain _John Trahern_, and _George Fenn_, deposed, the Prisoner to
be one of the Number, who, in an open Boat, pyratically assailed, and took
their Ship, and was remarkably busy at Mischief, having a Pole-Ax in his
Hand, which served him instead of a Key, to all the lock'd Doors and Boxes
he come nigh: Also in particular, he cut the Cable of our Ship, when the
other Pyrates were willing, and busied at heaving up the Anchor, saying,
Captain, what signifies this Trouble of _Yo Hope_ and straining in hot
Weather; there are more Anchors at _London_, and besides, your Ship is to
be burnt.

_William Smith_, (a Prisoner acquitted,) says _Walden_ was known among the
Pyrates mostly, by the Nick-Name of _Miss Nanney_ (ironically its presumed
from the Hardness of his Temper) that he was one of the twenty who
voluntarily came on Board the _Ranger_, in the Chace she made out after the
_Swallow_, and by a Shot from that Ship, lost his Leg; his Behaviour in the
Fight, till then, being bold and daring.

The _President_, called for _Harry Glasby_, and bid him relate a Character
of the Prisoner, and what Custom was among them, in Relation to these
voluntary Expeditions, out of their proper Ship; and this of going on Board
the _Ranger_, in particular.

And he gave in for Evidence, that the Prisoner was looked on as a brisk
Hand, (_i. e._ as he farther explained it, a stanch Pyrate, a great Rogue)
that when the _Swallow_ first appeared in Sight, every one was willing to
believe her a _Portuguese_, because Sugar was very much in Demand, and had
made some Jarring and Dissention between the two Companies, (the
_Fortune_'s People drinking Punch, when the _Ranger_'s could not) that
_Roberts_, on Sight of the _Swallow_, hailed the new _Ranger_, and bid them
right Ship, and get under Sail; there is, says he, Sugar in the Offing,
bring it in, that we may have no more Mumbling; ordering at the same Time
the Word to be pass'd among the Crew, who would go to their Assistance, and
immediately the Boat was full of Men, to transport themselves.

_President._ Then every one that goes on Board of any Prize, does it
voluntarily? Or were there here any other Reasons for it?

_H. Glasby._ Every Man is commonly called by List, and insists, in his
Turn, to go on Board of a Prize, because they then are allowed a Shift of
Cloaths, (the best they can find) over and above the Dividend from the
Robbery, and this they are so far from being compelled to, that it often
becomes the Occasion of Contest and Quarrel amongst them: But in the
present, or such like Cases, where there appears a Prospect of Trouble, the
Lazy and Timerous are often willing to decline this Turn, and yield to
their Betters, who thereby establish a greater Credit.

The Prisoner, and the rest of those Men who went from the _Fortune_ on
Board the _Ranger_, to assist in this Expedition, were Voluntiers, and the
trustiest Men among us.

_President._ Were there no Jealousies of the _Ranger_'s leaving you in this
Chace, or at any other Time, in order to surrender?

_H. Glasby._ Most of the _Ranger_'s Crew were fresh Men, Men who had been
enter'd only since their being on the Coast of _Guiney_, and therefore had
not so liberal a Share in fresh Provisions, or Wine, as the _Fortune_'s
People, who thought they had born the Burthen and Heat of the Day, which
had given Occasion indeed to some Grumblings and Whispers, as tho' they
would take an Opportunity to leave us, but we never supposed (if they did)
it would be with any other Design then setting up for themselves, they
having (many of them) behaved with greater Severity than the old Standers.

The Prisoner appeared undaunted, and rather solicitous, about resting his
Stump, than giving any Answer to the Court, or making any Defence for
himself, till called upon; then he related in a careless, or rather
hopeless Manner, the Circumstances of his first Entrance, being forced, he
said, out of the _Blessing_ of _Lemmington_, at _Newfoundland_, about 12
Months past; this, he is sure, most of the old Pyrates knew, and that he
was for some Time as sick of the Change as any Man; but Custom and ill
Company had altered him, owning very frankly, that he was at the Attack,
and taking of the _King Solomon_, that he did cut her Cable, and that none
were forced on those Occasions.

As to the last Expedition in the _Ranger_, he confesses he went on Board of
her, but that it was by _Robert_'s Order; and in the Chace loaded one Gun,
to bring her to, but when he saw it was a Bite, he declared to his
Comrades, that it was not worth while to resist, forbore firing, and
assisted to reeve the Braces, in order, if they could, to get away, in
which sort of Service he was busied, when a Shot from the Man of War took
off his Leg: And being asked, that supposing the Chace had proved a
_Portuguese_? Why then, says he, I dont know what I might have done,
intimating withal, that every Body then would have been ready enough at
plundering. _Guilty._

_Peter Scudamore._

H_Arry Glasby, Jo. Wingfield_, and _Nicholas Brattle_, depose thus
much, as to his being a Voluntier with the Pyrates, from Capt. _Rolls_, at
_Calabar._ First, That he quarrelled with _Moody_, (one of the Heads of the
Gang) and fought with him, because he opposed his going, asking _Rolls_, in
a leering manner, whether he would not be so kind, as to put him into the
_Gazette_, when he came Home. And, at another Time, when he was going from
the Pyrate Ship, in his Boat, a Turnado arose, _I wish_, says he, _the
Rascal may be drowned, for he is a great Rogue, and has endeavoured to do
me all the ill Offices he could among these Gentlemen_, (_i. e._Pyrates.)

And secondly, That he had signed the Pyrate's Articles with a great deal of
Alacrity, and gloried in having been the first Surgeon that had done so,
(for before this, it was their Custom to change their Surgeons, when they
desired it, after having served a Time, and never obliged them to sign, but
he was resolved to break thro' this, for the good of those who were to
follow,) swearing immediately upon it, he was now, he hoped, as great a
Rogue as any of them.

Captain _Jo. Trahern_, and _George Fenn_, his Mate, deposed, the Prisoner
to have taken out of the _King Solomon_, their Surgeon's capital
Instruments, some Medicines, and a Back-Gammon Table; which latter became
the Means of a Quarrel between one _Wincon_, and he, whose Property they
should be, and were yielded to the Prisoner.

_Jo. Sharp_, Master of the _Elizabeth_, heard the Prisoner ask _Roberts_
leave to force _Comry_, his Surgeon, from him, which was accordingly done,
and with him, carried also some of the Ship's Medicines: But what gave a
fuller Proof of the dishonesty of his Principles, was, the treacherous
Design he had formed of running away with the Prize, in her Passage to Cape
_Corso_, though he had been treated with all Humanity, and very unlike a
Prisoner, on Account of his Employ and better Education, which had rendred
him less to be suspected.

_Mr. Child_, (acquitted) depos'd, that in their Passage from the Island of
St. _Thomas_, in the _Fortune_ Prize, this Prisoner was several Times
tempting him, into Measures of rising with the Negroes, and killing the
_Swallow_'s People, shewing him, how easily the white Men might be
demolished, and a new Company raised at _Angola_, and that Part of the
Coast, _for_, says he, _I understand how to navigate a Ship, and can soon
teach you to steer; and is it not better to do this, than to go back to_
Cape-Corso, _and be hanged and Sun-dryed?_ To which the Deponent replying,
he was not afraid of being hanged, _Scudamore_ bid him be still, and no
Harm should come to him; but before the next Day-Evening, which was the
designed Time of executing this Project, the Deponent discovered it to the
Officer, and assured him, _Scudamore_ had been talking all the preceeding
Night to the Negroes, in _Angolan_ Language.

_Isaac Burnet_ heard the Prisoner ask _James Harris_, a Pyrate, (left with
the wounded in the Prize,) whether he was willing to come into the Project
of running away with the Ship, and endeavour the raising of a new Company,
but turned the Discourse to Horse-Racing, as the Deponent crept nigher; he
acquainted the Officer with what he had heard, who kept the People under
Arms all Night, their Apprehensions of the Negroes not being groundless;
for many of them having lived a long Time in this pyratical Way, were, by
the thin Commons they were now reduced to, as ripe for Mischief as any.

The Prisoner in his Defence said, he was a forced Man from Captain _Rolls_,
in _October_ last, and if he had not shewn such a Concern as became him, at
the Alteration, he must remark the Occasion to be, the Disagreement and
Enmity between them; but that both _Roberts_, and _Val. Ashplant_,
threat'ned him into signing their Articles, and that he did it in Terror.

The _King Solomon_, and _Elizabeth_ Medicine-Chest, he owns he plundered,
by Order of _Hunter_, the then chief Surgeon, who, by the Pyrates Laws,
always directs in this Province, and Mr. _Child_, (tho' acquitted) had by
the same Orders taken out a whole _French_ Medicine-Chest, which he must be
sensible for me, as well as for himself, we neither of us dared to have
denied; it was their being the proper Judges, made so ungrateful an Office
imposed. If after this he was elected chief Surgeon himself, both _Comry_
and _Wilson_ were set up also, and it might have been their Chance to have
carried it, and as much out of their Power to have refused.

As to the Attempt of rising and running away with the Prize, he denies it
altogether as untrue; a few foolish Words, but only by Way of Supposition,
that if the Negroes should take it in their Heads (considering the
Weakness, and ill look-out that was kept;) it would have been an easy
Matter, in his Opinion for them to have done it; but that he encouraged
such a Thing, was false, his talking to them in the _Angolan_ Language, was
only a Way of spending his Time, and trying his Skill to tell twenty, he
being incapable of further Talk. As to his understanding Navigation, he had
frequently acknowledg'd it to the Deponent _Child_, and wonders he should
now so circumstantiate this Skill against him. _Guilty._

_Robert Johnson._

IT appeared to the Court, that the Prisoner was one of the twenty
Men, in that Boat of the Pyrates, which afterwards robb'd the _King
Solomon_, at an Anchor near Cape _Appollonia_: That all Pyrates on this,
and the like Service, were Voluntiers, and he, in particular, had contested
his going on Board a second Time, tho' out of his Turn.

The Prisoner in his Defence, called for _Harry Glasby_, who witnessed to
his being so very drunk, when he first came among their Crew, that they
were forced to hoist him out of one Ship into the other, with a Tackle, and
therefore without his Consent; but had since been a trusty Man, and was
placed to the Helm, in that running Battle they made with the _Swallow._

He insisted for himself likewise, on Captain _Turner_'s Affidavit of his
being forced, on which others (his Ship-mates) had been cleared.

The Court considering the Partiality that might be objected in acquitting
one, and condemning another of the same standing, thought sit to remark it
as a clear Testimony of their Integrity, that their Care and Indulgence to
each Man, in allowing his particular Defence, was to exempt from the Rigour
of the Law, such, who it must be allowed, would have stood too
promiscuously condemned, if they had not been heard upon any other Fact
than that of the _Swallow_; and herein what could better direct them, than
a Character and Behaviour from their own Associates; for tho' a voluntary
Entry with the Pyrates may be doubtful, yet his consequent Actions are not,
and it is not so material how a Man comes among Pyrates, as how he acts
when he is there. _Guilty._

_George Wilson._

J_OHN Sharp_, Master of the _Elizabeth_, in which Ship the Prisoner
was Passenger, and fell a second Time into the Pyrates Hands, deposes, that
he took the said _Wilson_ off from _Sestos_, on this Coast, paying to the
Negroes for his Ransom, the Value of three Pound five Shillings in Goods,
for which he had taken a Note, that he thought he had done a charitable Act
in this, till meeting with one Captain _Canning_, he was ask'd, why he
would release such a Rogue as _Wilson_ was? For that he had been a
Voluntier with the Pyrates, out of _John Tarlton._ And when the Deponent
came to be a Prisoner himself, he found _Thomas_, the Brother of this _John
Tarlton_, a Prisoner with the Pyrates also, who was immediately on
_Wilson_'s Instigation, in a most sad manner misused and beat, and had been
shot, through the Fury and Rage of some of those Fellows, if the Town-side,
(_i. e. Liverpool_) Men, had not hid him in a Stay-Sail, under the
Bowsprit; for _Moody_ and _Harper_, with their Pistols cock'd, searched
every Corner of the Ship to find him, and came to this Deponent's Hammock,
whom they had like fatally to have mistaken for _Tarlton_, but on his
calling out, they found their Error, and left him with this comfortable
Anodyne, That he was the honest Fellow who brought the Doctor. At coming
away, the Prisoner asked about his Note, whether the Pyrates had it or no?
Who not being able readily to tell, he reply'd, it's no Matter Mr. _Sharp_,
I believe I shall hardly ever come to _England_ to pay it.

_Adam Comry_, Surgeon of the _Elizabeth_, says, that altho' the Prisoner
had, on Account of his Indisposition and Want, received many Civilities
from him, before meeting with the Pyrates, he yet understood it was thro'
his and _Scudamore_'s Means, that he had been compelled among them: The
Prisoner was very alert and chearful, he says, at meeting with _Roberts_,
hailed him, told him he was glad to see him, and would come on Board
presently, borrowing of the Deponent a clean Shirt and Drawers, for his
better Appearence and Reception; he signed their Articles willingly, and
used Arguments with him to do the same, saying, they should make their
Voyage in eight Months, to _Brasil_, Share 6 or 700 _l._ a Man, and then
break up. Again, when the Crew came to an Election of a chief Surgeon, and
this Deponent was set up with the others, _Wilson_ told him, he hoped he
should carry it from _Scudamore_, for that a quarter Share (which they had
more than others) would be worth looking after; but the Deponent missed the
Preferment, by the good Will of the _Ranger_'s People, who, in general,
voted for _Scudamore_, to get rid of him, (the chief Surgeon being always
to remain with the Commadore.)

It appeared likewise by the Evidence of Captain _Jo. Trahern, Tho. Castel_,
and others, who had been taken by the Pyrates, and thence had Opportunities
of observing the Prisoners Conduct, that he seem'd thoroughly satisfy'd
with that Way of Life, and was particularly intimate with _Roberts_; they
often scoffing at the Mention of a Man of War, and saying, if they should
meet with any of the Turnip-Man's Ships, they would blow up, and go to
H--ll together. Yet setting aside these silly Freaks, to recommend himself,
his Laziness had got him many Enemies, even _Roberts_ told him, (on the
Complaint of a wounded Man, whom he had refused to dress) that he was a
double Rogue, to be there a second Time, and threat'ned to cut his Ears
off.

The Evidence further assured the Court, from Captain _Thomas Tarlton_, that
the Prisoner was taken out of his Brother's Ship, some Months before, a
first Time, and being forward to oblige his new Company, had presently
ask'd for the Pyrates Boat, to fetch the Medicine Chest away; when the Wind
and Current proving too hard to contend with, they were drove on Shore at
Cape _Montzerado._

The Prisoner called for _William Darling_, and _Samuel Morwel_, (acquitted)
and _Nicholas Butler._

_William Darling_ deposed, the first Time the Prisoner fell into their
Hands, _Roberts_ mistook him for _Jo. Tarlton_ the Master, and being
informed it was the Surgeon who came to represent him, (then indisposed,)
he presently swore he should be his Mess-Mate, to which _Wilson_ reply'd,
he hop'd not, he had a Wife and Child, which the other laughed at; and that
he had been two Days on Board, before he went in that Boat, which was drove
on Shore at Cape _Montzerado._ And at his second coming, in the
_Elizabeth_, he heard _Roberts_ order he should be brought on Board in the
first Boat.

_Samuel Morwel_ says, that he has heard him bewail his Condition, while on
Board the Pyrate, and desired one _Thomas_, to use his Interest with
_Roberts_, for a Discharge, saying, his Employ, and the little Fortune he
had left at Home, would, he hop'd, exempt him the further Trouble of
seeking his Bread at Sea.

_Nicholas Butler_, who had remained with the Pyrates about 48 Hours, when
they took the _French_ Ships at _Whydah_, deposes, that in this Space the
Prisoner addressed him in the _French_ Language, several Times, deploring
the Wretchedness and ill Fortune of being confined in such Company.

The Prisoner desiring Liberty of two or three Questions, ask'd, whether or
no he had not expostulated with _Roberts_, for a Reason of his obliging
Surgeons to sign their Articles, when heretofore they did not; Whether he
had not expressed himself glad of having formerly escaped from them?
Whether he had not said, at taking the Ships in _Whydah_ Road, that he
could like the Sport, were it lawful? And whether if he had not told him,
should the Company discharge any Surgeon, that he would insist on it as his
Turn? The Deponent answered, Yes, to every Question separately; and
farther, that he believes _Scudamore_ had not seen _Wilson_ when he first
came and found him out of the _Elizabeth._

He added, in his own Defence, that being Surgeon with one _John Tarlton_,
of _Leverpool_, he was met a first Time on this Coast of _Guiney_, by
_Roberts_ the Pyrate; who, after a Day or two, told him, to his Sorrow,
that he was to stay there, and ordered him to fetch his Chest, (not
Medicines, as asserted,) which Opportunity he took to make his Escape; for
the Boat's Crew happening to consist of five _French_ and one _English_
Man, all as willing as himself, they agreed to push the Boat on Shore, and
trust themselves with the Negroes of Cape _Montzerado_: Hazardous, not only
in Respect of the dangerous Seas that run there, but the Inhumanity of the
Natives, who sometimes take a liking to humane Carcasses. Here he remained
five Months, till _Thomas Tarlton_, Brother to his Captain chanced to put
in the Road for Trade, to whom he represented his Hardships and starving
Condition; but was, in an unchristian Manner, both refused a Release of
this Captivity, or so much as a small Supply of Biscuit and salt Meat,
because, as he said, he had been among the Pyrates. A little Time after
this, the Master of a _French_ Ship paid a Ransom for him, and took him
off; but, by Reason of a nasty leperous Indisposition he had contracted by
hard and bad living, was, to his great Misfortune set ashore at _Sestos_
again, when Captain _Sharp_ met him, and generously procured his Release in
the Manner himself has related, and for which he stands infinitely
obliged.--That ill Luck threw him a second Time into the Pyrate's Hands, in
this Ship _Elizabeth_, where he met _Thomas Tarlton_, and thoughtlesly used
some Reproaches of him, for his severe Treatment at _Montzerado_; but
protests without Design his Words should have had so bad a Consequence; for
_Roberts_ took upon him, as a Dispenser of Justice, the Correction of Mr.
_Tarlton_, beating him unmercifully; and he hopes it will be belived,
contrary to any Intention of his it should so happen, because as a Stranger
he might be supposed to have no Influence, and believes there were some
other Motives for it.--He cannot remember he expressed himself glad to see
_Roberts_ this second Time, or that he dropped those Expressions about
_Comry_, as are sworn; but if immaturity of Judgment had occasioned him to
slip rash and inadvertent Words, or that he had paid any undue Compliments
to _Roberts_, it was to ingratiate himself, as every Prisoner did, for a
more civil Treatment, and in particular to procure his Discharge, which he
had been promised, and was afraid would have been revoked, if such a Person
as _Comry_ did not remain there to supply his Room; and of this, he said,
all the Gentlemen (meaning the Pyrates) could witness for him.

He urged also his Youth in Excuse for his Rashness.--The first time he had
been with them (only a Month in all,) and that in no military Employ; but
in particular, the Service he had done in discovering the Design the
Pyrates had to rise in their Passage on Board the _Swallow. Guilty._

                                * * *

But Execution respited till the King's Pleasure be known, because the
Commander of the _Swallow_ had declared, the first Notice he received of
this Design of the Pyrates to rise, was from him.

_Benjamin Jefferys_

BY the Depositions of _Glasby_ and _Lillburn_ (acquitted) against
this Prisoner, it appeared, that his Drunkenness was what at first detained
him from going away in his proper Ship, the _Norman_ Galley; and next
Morning, for having been abusive in his Drink, saying to the Pyrates, there
was not a Man amongst them, he received for a Welcome, six Lashes from
every Person in the Ship, which disordered him for some Weeks, but on
Recovery was made Boatswain's Mate; the serving of which, or any Office on
Board a Pyrate, is at their own Option, (tho' elected,) because others are
glad to accept what brings an additional Share in Prize.

The Deponents further say, that at _Sierraleon_ every Man had more
especially the Means of escaping; and that this Prisoner, in particular,
neglected it, and came off from that Place after their Ship was under Sail,
and going out of the River.

The Prisoner, in his Defence, protests, he was at first forc'd; and that
the Office of Boatswain's Mate was imposed on him, and what he would have
been glad to have relinquish'd. That the barbarous Whipping he had received
from the Pyrates at first, was for telling them, that none who could get
their Bread in an honest Way, would be on such an Account. And he had
certainly taken the Opportunity which presented at _Sierraleon_, of ridding
himself from so distastful a Life, if there had not been three or four of
the old Pyrates on Shore at the same Time, who, he imagined, must know of
him, and would doubtless have served him the same, if not worse, than they
since had done _William Williams_; who, for such a Design, being delivered
up by the treacherous Natives, had received two Lashes thro' the whole
Ship's Company.

The Court observed, the Excuses of these Pyrates, about want of Means to
escape, was oftentimes as poor and evasive as their Pleas of being forced
at first; for here, at _Sierraleon_, every Man had his Liberty on Shore,
and it was evident, might have kept it, if he, or they, had so pleased. And
such are further culpable, who having been introduced into the Society, by
such uncivil Methods, as whipping, or beating, neglect less likely Means of
regaining Liberty; it shews strong Inclinations to Dishonesty, and they
stand inexcusably, _Guilty._

_Jo. Mansfield._

IT was proved against this Prisoner, by Captain _Trahern_ and _George
Fenn_, that he was one of those Voluntiers who was at the Attack and
Robbery of the Company's Ship, called the _King Solomon_: That he bully'd
well among them who dar'd not make any Reply, but was very easy with his
Friends, who knew him; for _Moody_, on this Occasion, took a large Glass
from him, and threatned to blow his Brains out, (a favourite Phrase with
these Pyrates) if he muttered at it.

From others acquitted, it likewise appeared, that he was at first a
Voluntier among them, from an Island call'd _Dominico_, in the
_West-Indies_, and had to recommend himself, told them, he was a Deserter
from the _Rose_ Man of War, and before that, had been on the High-Way; he
was always drunk, they said, and so bad at the Time they met with the
_Swallow_, that he knew nothing of the Action, but came up vapouring with
his Cutlash, after the _Fortune_ had struck her Colours, to know who would
go on Board the Prize; and it was some Time before they could perswade him
into the Truth of their Condition.

He could say little in Defence of himself, acknowledg'd this latter Part of
Drunkenness; a Vice, he says, that had too great a Share in insnaring him
into this Course of Life, and had been a greater Motive with him than Gold.
_Guilty._

_William Davis._

W_Illiam Allen_ deposed, he knew this Prisoner at _Sierraleon_,
belonging to the _Ann_ Galley; that he had a Quarrel with, and beat the
Mate of that Ship, for which (as he said) being afraid to return to his
Duty, he consorted to the idle Customs and Ways of living among the
Negroes, from whom he received a Wife, and ungratefully sold her, one
Evening, for some Punch to quench his Thirst. After this, having put
himself under the Protection of Mr. _Plunket_, Governor there for the Royal
_African_ Company: The Relations and Friends of the Woman, apply'd to him
for Redress, who immediately surrendered the Prisoner, and told them, he
did not care if they took his Head off; but the Negroes wisely judging it
would not fetch so good a Price, they sold him in his Turn again to
Seignior _Jossee_, a Christian Black, and Native of that Place; who
expected and agreed for two Years Service from him, on Consideration of
what he had disbursed, for the Redemption of the Woman: But long before the
Expiration of this Time, _Roberts_ came into _Sierraleon_ River, where the
Prisoner, (as Seignior _Jossee_ assured the Deponent,) entered a Voluntier
with them.

The Deponent further corroborates this Part of the Evidence; in that he
being obliged to call at Cape _Mount_, in his Passage down hither, met
there with two Deserters from _Roberts_'s Ship, who assured him of the
same; and that the Pyrates did design to turn _Davis_ away the next
Opportunity, as an idle good-for-nothing Fellow.

From _Glasby_ and _Lilburn_, it was evident, that every Pyrate, while they
stay'd at _Sierraleon_, went on Shore at Discretion. That _Roberts_ had
often assured Mr. _Glyn_ and other Traders, at that Place, that he would
force no Body; and in short, there was no Occasion for it; in particular,
the Prisoner's Row-Mate went away, and thinks, he might have done the same,
if he had pleased.

The Prisoner alledged his having been detained against his Will, and says,
that returning with Elephants Teeth for _Sierraleon_, the Pyrate's Boat
pursued and brought him on Board, where he was kept on Account of his
understanding the Pilotage and Navigation of that River.

It was obvious to the Court, not only how frivolous Excuses of Constraint
and Force were among these People, at their first commencing Pyrates, but
also it was plain to them, from these two Deserters, met at Cape _Mount_,
and the discretional Manner they lived in, at _Sierraleon_; thro' how
little Difficulty several of them did, and others might, have escaped
afterwards, if they could but have obtained their own Consents for it.
_Guilty._

                                * * *

This is the Substance of the Tryals of _Roberts_'s Crew, which may suffice
for others, that occur in this Book. The foregoing Lists, shews, by a *
before the Names, who were condemn'd; those Names with a + were referred
for Tryal to the _Marshalsea_, and all the rest were acquitted.

The Remainder of the Pyrates, whose Names are under mentioned, upon their
humble Petition to the Court, had their Sentence changed from Death, to
seven Years Servitude, conformable to our Sentence of Transportation; the
Petition is as follows.

                                * * *

_To the Honourable the President and Judges of the Court of
Admiralty, for trying of Pyrates, sitting at_ Cape Corso-Castle; _the_
20_th Day of_ April, 1722.

The humble Petition of _Thomas How, Samuel Fletcher_, &c.

      Humbly sheweth,

T_HAT your Petitioners being unhappily, and unwarily drawn into that
wretched and detestable Crime of Pyracy, for which they now stand justly
condemned, they most humbly pray the Clemency of the Court, in the
Mitigation of their Sentence, that they may be permitted to serve the
Royal_ African _Company of_ England, _in this Country for seven Years, in
such a Manner as the Court shall think proper; that by their just
Punishment, being made sensible of the Error of their former Ways, they
will for the future become faithful Subjects, good Servants, and useful in
their Stations, if it please the Almighty to prolong their Lives._

And your Petitioners, as in Duty, _&c._

The Resolution of the Court was,

T_HAT the Petitioners have Leave by this Court of Admiralty, to
interchange Indentures with the Captain General of the_ Gold Coast, _for
the Royal_ African _Company, for seven Years Servitude, at any of the
Royal_ African _Company's Settlements in_ Africa, _in such Manner as he the
said Captain General shall think proper._

_On_ Thursday _the_ 26_th Day of_ April, _the Indentures being all drawn
out, according to the Grant made to the Petitioners, by the Court held on_
Friday _the_ 20_th of this Instant; each Prisoner was sent for up, signed,
sealed and exchanged them in the Presence of_

_Captain_ Mungo Herdman, _President_, James Phipps, _Esq_; _Mr._
Edward Hyde, _Mr._ Charles Fanshaw, _And Mr._ John Atkins, _Register._

_A Copy of the Indenture._

   The Indenture of a Person
   condemned to serve abroad for Pyracy, which, upon the
   humble Petition of the Pyrates therein mentioned, was
   most mercifully granted by his Imperial Majesty's
   Commissioners and Judges appointed to hold a Court of
   Admiralty, for the Tryal of Pyrates at Cape
   _Corso-Castle_, in _Africa_, upon Condition of serving
   seven Years, and other Conditions, are as follows,
   _viz._

T_HIS Indenture made the twenty sixth Day of_ April, Anno Regni Regis
Georgii magnæ Britanniæ, _&c._ Septimo, Domini, Millessimo, Sepcentessimo
viginti duo, _between_ Roger Scot, _late of the City of_ Bristol _Mariner,
of the one Part, and the Royal_ African _Company of_ England, _their

I am not ignorant how acceptable the Behaviour and dying Words of
Malefactors are to the generallity of our Countrymen, and therefore shall
deliver what occurr'd, worthy of Notice, in the Behaviour of these
Criminals.

The first six that were called to Execution, were _Magnes, Moody, Sympson,
Sutton, Ashplant_, and _Hardy_; all of them old Standers and notorious
Offenders: When they were brought out of the Hold, on the Parade, in order
to break off their Fetters, and fit the Halters; none of them, it was
observed, appeared the least dejected, unless _Sutton_, who spoke faint,
but it was rather imputed to a Flux that had seiz'd him two or three Days
before, than Fear. A Gentleman, who was Surgeon of the Ship, was so
charitable at this Time, to offer himself in the room of an Ordinary, and
represented to them, as well as he was able, the Heinousness of their Sin,
and Necessity which lay on them of Repentance; one particular Part of which
ought to be, acknowledging the Justice they had met with. They seem'd
heedless for the present, some calling for Water to drink, and others
applying to the Soldiers for Caps, but when this Gentleman press'd them for
an Answer, they all exclaim'd against the Severity of the Court, and were
so harden'd, as to curse, and wish the same Justice might overtake all the
Members of it, as had been dealt to them. _They were poor Rogues_, they
said, _and so hang'd, while others, no less guilty in another Way,
escaped._

When he endeavoured to compose their Minds, exhorting them to dye in
Charity with all the World, and would have diverted them from such vain
Discourse, by asking them their Country, Age, and the like; some of them
answered, `What was that to him, they suffered the Law, and should give no
Account but to God;´ walking to the Gallows without a Tear, in Token of
Sorrow for their past Offences, or shewing as much Concern as a Man would
express at travelling a bad Road; nay, _Sympson_, at seeing a Woman that he
knew, said, `he had lain with that B--h three times, and now she was come
to see him hang'd.´ And _Hardy_, when his Hands were ty'd behind him,
(which happened from their not being acquainted with the Way of bringing
Malefactors to Execution,) observed, `that he had seen many a Man hang'd,
but this Way of the Hands being ty'd behind them, he was a Stranger to, and
never saw before in his Life.´ I mention these two little Instances, to
shew how stupid and thoughtless they were of their End, and that the same
abandoned and reprobate Temper that had carried them thro' their Rogueries,
abided with them to the last.

_Samuel Fletcher_, another of the Pyrates ordered for Execution, but
reprieved, seem'd to have a quicker Sense of his Condition; for when he saw
those he was allotted with gone to Execution, he sent a Message by the
Provost-Marshal to the Court, to be `inform'd of the Meaning of it, and
humbly desir'd to know whether they design'd him Mercy, or not? If they
did, he stood infinitely oblig'd to them, and thought the whole Service of
his Life an incompetent Return for so great a Favour; but that if he was to
suffer, the sooner the better, _he said_, that he might be out of his
Pain.´

There were others of these Pyrates the reverse of this, and tho' destitute
of Ministers, or fit Persons to represent their Sins, and assist them with
spiritual Advice, were yet always imploying their Time to good Purposes,
and behaved with a great deal of seeming Devotion and Penitence; among
these may be reckon'd _Scudamore, Williams, Philips, Stephenson, Jefferys,
Lesly, Harper, Armstrong, Bunce_, and others.

_Scudamore_ too lately discerned the Folly and Wickedness of the
Enterprize, that had chiefly brought him under Sentence of Death, from
which, seeing there was no Hopes of escaping, he petitioned for two or
three Days Reprieve, which was granted; and for that Time apply'd himself
incessantly to Prayer, and reading the Scriptures, seem'd to have a deep
Sense of his Sins, of this in particular, and desired, at the Gallows, they
would have Patience with him, to sing the first Part of the thirty first
Psalm; which he did by himself throughout.

_Armstrong_, having been a Deserter from his Majesty's Service, was
executed on Board the _Weymouth_, (and the only one that was;) there was no
Body to press him to an Acknowledgement of the Crime he died for, nor of
sorrowing in particular for it, which would have been exemplary, and made
suitable Impressions on Seamen; so that his last Hour was spent in
lamenting and bewailing his Sins in general, exhorting the Spectators to an
honest and good Life, in which alone they could find Satisfaction. In the
End, he desir'd they would join with him in singing two or three latter
Verses of the 140th Psalm; and that being concluded, he was, at the firing
of a Gun, tric'd up at the Fore-Yard-Arm.

_Bunce_ was a young Man, not above 26 Years old, but made the most
pathetical Speech of any at the Gallows. He first declaim'd against the
guilded Bates of Power, Liberty, and Wealth, that had ensnar'd him among
the Pyrates, his unexperienc'd Years not being able to withstand the
Temptation; but that the Briskness he had shewn, which so fatally had
procured him Favour amongst them, was not so much a Fault in Principle, as
the Liveliness and Vivacity of his Nature. He was now extreamly afflicted
for the Injuries he had done to all Men, and begg'd their's and God's
Forgiveness, very earnestly exhorting the Spectators to remember their
Creator in their Youth, and guard betimes, that their Minds took not a
wrong Byass, concluding with this apt Similitude, _That he stood there as a
Beacon upon a Rock_, (the Gallows standing on one) _to warn erring
Marriners of Danger._

CHAP. X. OF Captain _ANSTIS_, And his CREW.

T_HOMAS Anstis_ ship'd himself at _Providence_ in the Year 1718,
aboard the _Buck_ Sloop, and was one of six that conspired together to go
off a pyrating with the Vessel; the rest were, _Howel Davis, Roberts_'s
Predecessor, killed at the Island of _Princes; Dennis Topping_, killed at
the taking of the rich _Portuguese_ Ship on the Coast of _Brasil; Walter
Kennedy_, hanged at _Execution-Dock_, and two others, which I forbear to
name, because, I understand they are at this Day employ'd in an honest
Vocation in the City.

What followed concerning _Anstis_'s Pyracies, has been included in the two
preceeding Chapters; I shall only observe that the Combination of these six
Men abovementioned, was the Beginning of that Company, that afterwards
proved so formidable under Captain _Roberts_, from whom _Anstis_ separated
the 18th of _April_ 1721, in the _Good Fortune_ Brigantine, leaving his
Commadore to pursue his Adventures upon the Coast of _Guiney_, whilst he
returned to the _West-Indies_, upon the like Design.

About the Middle of _June_, these Pyrates met with one Captain _Marston_,
between _Hispaniola_ and _Jamaica_, bound on a Voyage to _New-York_; from
whom they took all the wearing Apparel they could find, as also his Liquors
and Provision, and five of his Men, but did not touch his Cargo; two or
three other Vessels were also plundered by them, in this Cruise, out of
whom they stocked themselves with Provision and Men; among the rest, I
think, was the _Irwin_, Captain _Ross_, from _Cork_ in _Ireland_; but this
I won't be positive of, because they denied it themselves. This Ship had
600 Barrels of Beef aboard, besides other Provisions, and was taken off
_Martinico_, wherein Colonel _Doyly_ of _Montserrat_, and his Family were
Passengers. The Colonel was very much abused and wounded, for endeavouring
to save a poor Woman, that was also a Passenger, from the Insults of that
brutish Crew; and the Pyrates prevailing, twenty one of them forced the
poor Creature successively, afterwards broke her Back and flung her into
the Sea. I say, I will not be positive it was _Anstis_'s Crew that acted
this unheard of Violence and Cruelty, tho' the Circumstances of the Place,
the Time, the Force of the Vessel, and the Number of Men, do all concur,
and I can place the Villany no where else; but that such a Fact was done,
there is too much Evidence for it to be doubted of.

When they thought fit to put an End to this Cruize, they went into one of
the Islands to clean, which they effected without any Disturbance, and came
out again, and stretching away towards _Burmudas_, met with a stout Ship,
called the _Morning Star_, bound from _Guiney_ to _Carolina_; they made
Prize of her, and kept her for their own Use. In a Day or two, a Ship from
_Barbadoes_ bound to _New-York_, fell into their Hands, and taking out her
Guns and Tackle, mounted the _Morning Star_ with 32 Pieces of Cannon,
mann'd her with a 100 Men, and appointed one _John Fenn_ Captain; for the
Brigantine being of far less Force, the _Morning Star_ would have fallen to
_Anstis_, as elder Officer, yet he was so in Love with his own Vessel, (she
being an excellent Sailor,) that he made it his Choice to stay in her, and
let _Fenn_, who was, before, his Gunner, Command the great Ship.

Now, that they had two good Ships well mann'd, it may be supposed they were
in a Condition to undertake something bold: But their Government was
disturbed by Malecontents, and a Kingdom divided within it self cannot
stand; they had such a Number of new Men amongst them, that seem'd not so
violently enclined for the Game; that whatever the Captain proposed, it was
certainly carried against him, so that they came to no fix'd Resolution for
the undertaking any Enterprize; therefore there was nothing to be done, but
to break up the Company, which seemed to be the Inclination of the
Majority, but the Manner of doing so, concerned their common Safety; to
which Purpose various Means were proposed, at length it was concluded to
send home a Petition to his Majesty (there being then no Act of Indemnity
in Force) for a Pardon, and wait the Issue; at the same Time one _Jones_,
Boatswain of the _Good Fortune_, proposed a Place of safe Retreat, it being
an uninhabited Island near _Cuba_, which he had been used to in the late
War, when he went a privateering against the _Spaniards._

This being approved of, it was unanimously resolved on, and the
underwritten Petition drawn up and signed by the whole Company in the
Manner of what they call a _Round Robin_, that is, the Names were writ in a
Circle, to avoid all Appearance of Pre-eminence, and least any Person
should be mark'd out by the Government, as a principal Rogue among them.

_To his most sacred Majesty_ George, _by the Grace of God, of_
Great-Britain, France _and_ Ireland, _King, Defender of the Faith_, &c.

The humble PETITION of the Company, now belonging to the Ship
_Morning Star_, and Brigantine _Good Fortune_, lying under the ignominious
Name and Denomination of PYRATES.

      Humbly sheweth,

T_HAT we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, have, at sundry Times,
been taken by_ Bartholomew Roberts, _the then Captain of the abovesaid
Vessels and Company, together with another Ship, in which we left him; and
have been forced by him and his wicked Accomplices, to enter into, and
serve, in the said Company, as Pyrates, much contrary to our Wills and
Inclinations: And we your loyal Subjects utterly abhoring and detesting
that impious way of Living, did, with an unanimous Consent, and contrary to
the Knowledge of the said_ Roberts, _or his Accomplices, on, or about the_
18_th Day of_ April 1721, _leave, and ran away with the aforesaid Ship_
Morning Star, _and Brigantine_ Good Fortune, _with no other Intent and
Meaning than the Hopes of obtaining your Majesty's most gracious Pardon.
And, that we your Majesty's most loyal Subjects, may with more Safety
return to our native Country, and serve the Nation, unto which we belong,
in our respective Capacities, without Fear of being prosecuted by the
Injured, whose Estates have suffered by the said_ Roberts _and his
Accomplices, during our forcible Detainment, by the said Company: We most
humbly implore your Majesty's most royal Assent, to this our humble
Petition._

And your Petitioners shall ever pray.

This Petition was sent home by a Merchant Ship bound to _England_, from
_Jamaica_, who promised to speak with the Petitioners, in their Return,
about 20 Leagues to Windward of that Island, and let them know what Success
their Petition met with. When this was done, the Pyrates retires to the
Island before proposed, with the Ship and Brigantine.

This Island (which I have no Name for) lies off the Southwest End of
_Cuba_, uninhabited, and little frequented. On the East End is a Lagune, so
narrow, that a Ship can but just go in, tho' there's from 15 to 22 Foot
Water, for almost a League up: On both Sides of the Lagune grows red
Mangrove Trees, very thick, that the Entrance of it, as well as the Vessels
laying there, is hardly to be seen. In the Middle of the Island are here
and there a small thick Wood of tall Pines, and other Trees scattered about
in different Places.

Here they staid about nine Months, but not having Provision for above two,
they were forced to take what the Island afforded, which was Fish of
several Sorts, particularly Turtle, which latter was the chiefest Food they
lived on, and was found in great Plenty on the Coasts of this Island;
whether there might be any wild Hogs, Beef, or other Cattle, common to
several Islands of the _West-Indies_, or that the Pyrates were too idle to
hunt them, or whether they preferr'd other Provisions to that sort of Diet,
I know not; but I was informed by them, that for the whole Time they eat
not a Bit of any kind of Flesh-Meat, nor Bread; the latter was supply'd by
Rice, of which they had a great Quantity aboard: This was boyl'd and
squeez'd dry, and so eat with the Turtle.

There are three or four Sorts of these Creatures in the _West-Indies_, the
largest of which will weight 150 or 200 Pound Weight or more, but those
that were found upon this Island were of the smallest Kind, weighing 10 or
12 Pounds each, with a fine natural wrought Shell, and beautifully clouded;
the Meat sweet and tender, some Part of it eating like Chicken, some like
Veal, _&c._ so that it was no extraordinary Hardship for them to live upon
this Provision alone, since it affords variety of Meats to the Taste, of it
self. The manner of catching this Fish is very particular; you must
understand, that in the Months of _May, June_ and _July_, they lay their
Eggs in order to hatch their Young, and this three times in a Season, which
is always in the Sand of the Sea-shore, each laying 80 or 90 Eggs at a
time. The Male accompanies the Female, and come ashore in the Night only,
when they must be watch'd, without making any Noise, or having a Light; as
soon as they land, the Men that watch for them, turn them on their Backs,
then haul them above high Water Mark, and leave them till next Morning,
where they are sure to find them, for they can't turn again, nor move from
the Place. It is to be observ'd, that besides their laying time, they come
ashore to feed, but then what's very remarkable in these Creatures, they
always resort to different Places to breed, leaving their usual Haunts for
two or three Months, and 'tis thought they eat nothing in all that Season.

They pass'd their Time here in Dancing, and other Diversions, agreeable to
these sort of Folks; and among the rest, they appointed a Mock Court of
Judicature to try one another for Pyracy, and he that was a Criminal one
Day was made Judge another.-- I had an Account given me of one of these
merry Tryals, and as it appeared diverting, I shall give the Readers a
short Account of it.

The Court and Criminals being both appointed, as also Council to plead, the
Judge got up in a Tree, and had a dirty Taurpaulin hung over his Shoulders;
this was done by Way of Robe, with a Thrum Cap on his Head, and a large
Pair of Spectacles upon his Nose: Thus equipp'd, he settled himself in his
Place, and abundance of Officers attending him below, with Crows,
Handspikes, _&c._ instead of Wands, Tipstaves, and such like.-- The
Criminals were brought out, making a thousand sour Faces; and one who acted
as Attorney-General opened the Charge against them; their Speeches were
very laconick, and their whole Proceedings concise. We shall give it by Way
of Dialogue.

_Attorn. Gen._ An't please your Lordship, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,
here is a Fellow before you that is a sad Dog, a sad sad Dog; and I humbly
hope your Lordship will order him to be hang'd out of the Way
immediately.--He has committed Pyracy upon the High Seas, and we shall
prove, an't please your Lordship, that this Fellow, this sad Dog before
you, has escap'd a thousand Storms, nay, has got safe ashore when the Ship
has been cast away, which was a certain Sign he was not born to be drown'd;
yet not having the Fear of hanging before his Eyes, he went on robbing and
ravishing Man, Woman and Child, plundering Ships Cargoes fore and aft,
burning and sinking Ship, Bark and Boat, as if the Devil had been in him.
But this is not all, my Lord, he has committed worse Villanies than all
these, for we shall prove, that he has been guilty of drinking Small-Beer;
and your Lordship knows, there never was a sober Fellow but what was a
Rogue.--My Lord, I should have spoke much finer than I do now, but that, as
your Lordship knows our Rum is all out, and how should a Man speak good Law
that has not drank a Dram.--However, I hope, your Lordship will order the
Fellow to be hang'd.

_Judge._--Hearkee me, Sirrah,--you lousy, pittiful, ill-look'd Dog; what
have you to say why you should not be tuck'd up immediately, and set a
Sun-drying like a Scare-crow?--Are you guilty, or not guilty?

_Pris._ Not guilty, an't please your Worship.

_Judge._ Not guilty! say so again, Sirrah, and I'll have you hang'd without
any Tryal.

_Pris._ An't please your Worship's Honour, my Lord, I am as honest a poor
Fellow as ever went between Stem and Stern of a Ship, and can hand, reef,
steer, and clap two Ends of a Rope together, as well as e'er a He that ever
cross'd salt Water; but I was taken by one _George Bradley_ [the Name of
him that sat as Judge,] a notorious Pyrate, a sad Rogue as ever was
unhang'd, and he forc'd me, an't please your Honour.

_Judge._ Answer me, Sirrah,--How will you be try'd?

_Pris._ By G-- and my Country.

_Judge._ The Devil you will.--Why then, Gentlemen of the Jury, I think we
have nothing to do but to proceed to Judgment.

_Attor. Gen._ Right, my Lord; for if the Fellow should be suffer'd to
speak, he may clear himself, and that's an Affront to the Court.

_Pris._ Pray, my Lord, I hope your Lordship will consider--

_Judge._ Consider!--How dare you talk of considering? --Sirrah, Sirrah, I
never consider'd in all my Life. --I'll make it Treason to consider.

_Pris._ But, I hope, your Lordship will hear some Reason.

_Judge._ D'ye hear how the Scoundrel prates?--What have we to do with
Reason?--I'd have you to know, Raskal, we don't sit here to hear
Reason;--we go according to Law.--Is our Dinner ready?

_Attor. Gen._ Yes, my Lord.

_Judge._ Then heark'ee, you Raskal at the Bar; hear me, Sirrah, hear
me.--You must suffer, for three Reasons; first, because it is not fit I
should sit here as Judge, and no Body be hang'd.--Secondly, you must be
hang'd, because you have a damn'd hanging Look:--And thirdly, you must be
hang'd, because I am hungry; for know, Sirrah, that 'tis a Custom, that
whenever the Judge's Dinner is ready before the Tryal is over, the Prisoner
is to be hang'd of Course.--There's Law for you, ye Dog.--So take him away
Goaler.

                                * * *

This is the Tryal just as it was related to me; the Design of my setting it
down, is only to shew how these Fellows can jest upon Things, the Fear and
Dread of which, should make them tremble.

The beginning of _August_ 1722, the Pyrates made ready the Brigantine, and
came out to Sea, and beating up to Windward, lay in the Track for their
Correspondant in her Voyage to _Jamaica_, and spoke with her; but finding
nothing was done in _England_ in their Favour, as 'twas expected, they
return'd to their Consorts at the Island with the ill News, and found
themselves under a Necessity, as they fancied, to continue that abominable
Course of Life they had lately practis'd; in order thereto, they sail'd
with the Ship and Brigantine to the Southward, and the next Night, by
intolerable Neglect, they run the _Morning Star_ upon the _Grand Caimanes_,
and wreck'd her; the Brigantine seeing the Fate of her Consort, hall'd off
in Time, and so weather'd the Island. The next Day Captain _Anstis_ put in,
and found that all, or the greatest part of the Crew, were safe ashore,
whereupon she came to an Anchor, in order to fetch them off; and having
brought _Fenn_ the Captain, _Philips_ the Carpenter, and a few others
aboard, two Men of War came down upon them, _viz._ the _Hector_ and
_Adventure_, so that the Brigantine had but just Time to cut their Cable,
and get to Sea, with one of the Men of War after her, keeping within
Gun-shot for several Hours. _Anstis_ and his Crew were now under the
greatest Consternation imaginable, finding the Gale freshen, and the Man of
War gaining Ground upon them, so that, in all Probability, they must have
been Prisoners in two Hours more; but it pleased God to give them a little
longer Time, the Wind dying away, the Pyrates got out their Oars, and row'd
for their Lives, and thereby got clear of their Enemy.

The _Hector_ landed her Men upon the Island, and took 40 of the _Morning
Star_'s Crew, without any Resistance made by them; but on the contrary,
alledging, they were forc'd Men, and that they were glad of this
Opportunity to escape from the Pyrates; the rest hid themselves in the
Woods, and could not be found. _George Bradley_ the Master, and three more,
surrender'd afterwards to a _Burmudas_ Sloop, and were carried to that
Island.

The Brigantine, after her Escape, sail'd to a small Island near the Bay of
_Honduras_, to clean and refit, and, in her Way thither, took a _Rhode
Island_ Sloop, Captain _Durfey_, Commander, and two or three other Vessels,
which they destroy'd, but brought all the Hands aboard their own.

While she was cleaning, a Scheme was concerted between Captain _Durfey_,
some other Prisoners, and two or three of the Pyrates, for to seize some of
the Chiefs, and carry off the Brigantine; but the same being discovered
before she was fit for sailing, their Design was prevented: However,
Captain _Durfey_, and four or five more, got ashore with some Arms and
Ammunition; and when the Pyrates Canoe came in for Water, he seiz'd the
Boat with the Men; upon which _Anstis_ ordered another Boat to be mann'd
with 30 Hands and sent ashore, which was accordingly done; but Captain
_Durfey_, and the Company he had by that Time got together, gave them such
a warm Reception, that they were contented to betake themselves to their
Vessel again.

About the beginning of _December_, 1722, _Anstis_ left this Place and
return'd to the Islands, designing to accumulate all the Power and Strength
he could, since there was no looking back. He took in the Cruise a good
Ship, commanded by Captain _Smith_, which he mounted with 24 Guns, and
_Fenn_, a one handed Man, who commanded the _Morning-Star_ when she was
lost, went aboard to command her. They cruis'd together, and took a Vessel
or two, and then went to the _Bahama Islands_, and there met with what they
wanted, _viz._ a Sloop loaded with Provisions, from _Dublin_, called the
_Antelope._

It was time now to think of some Place to fit up and clean their Frigate
lately taken, and put her in a Condition to do Business; accordingly they
pitch'd upon the Island of _Tobago_, where they arrived the beginning of
_April_, 1723, with the _Antelope_ Sloop and her Cargo.

They fell to work immediately, got the Guns, Stores, and every Thing else
out upon the Island, and put the Ship upon the Heel; and just then, as ill
Luck would have it, came in the _Winchelsea_ Man of War, by Way of Visit,
which put the Marooners into such a Surprize, that they set Fire to the
Ship and Sloop, and fled ashore to the Woods. _Anstis_, in the Brigantine,
escap'd, by having a light Pair of Heels, but it put his Company into such
a Disorder, that their Government could never be set to rights again; for
some of the New-Comers, and those who had been tir'd with the Trade, put an
End to the Reign, by shooting _Tho. Anstis_ in his Hammock, and afterwards
the Quarter-Master, and two or three others; the rest submitting, they put
into Irons, and surrender'd them up, and the Vessel, at _Curacco_, a
_Dutch_ Settlement, where they were try'd and hang'd; and those concerned
in delivering up the Vessel, acquitted.

But to return to Captain _Fenn_, he was taken stragling with his Gunner and
three more, a Day or two after their Misfortune, by the Man of War's Men,
and carry'd to _Antegoa_, where they were all executed, and _Fenn_ hang'd
in Chains. Those who remain'd, staid some Time in the Island, keeping up
and down in the Woods, with a Hand to look out; at length Providence so
order'd it, that a small Sloop came into the Harbour, which they all got
aboard of, except two or three Negroes, and those they left behind. They
did not think fit to pursue any further Adventures, and therefore
unanimously resolved to steer for _England_, which they accordingly did,
and in _October_ last came into _Bristol_ Channel, sunk the Sloop, and
getting ashore in the Boat, dispersed themselves to their Abodes.

CHAP. XI. OF Captain _WORLEY_, And his CREW.

HIS Reign was but short, but his Beginning somewhat particular,
setting out in a small _This Second Edition of this Work, notwithstanding a large Impression of
the First, is a Certificate from the World of its general Acceptation;
so we need not, according to the Custom of Editors, boast of it without
Evidence, or tell a F----b in its Favour._

_The Subject is singular, and it has been handled after a singular
Manner: The wise World has been pleased with it, the merry World has
been diverted with it, and the ignorant World has been taught by it;
none but the malicious part of the World has been offended at it: Who
can wonder, that when the_ Devil _is not pleased,_ his Friends should be
angry?

_The strangest thing of it all is, to hear_ Satan _complain that the
Story is handled prophanely: But who can think it strange that his
Advocates should_ BE, what he was from the Beginning?

_The Author affirms, and has good Vouchers for it (in the Opinion of
such whose Judgment passes with him for an Authority) that the whole
Tenor of the Work is solemn, calculated to promote serious Religion, and
capable of being improv'd in a religious manner. But he does not think
that we are bound never to speak of the_ Devil _but with an Air of
Terror, as if we were always afraid of him._

_'Tis evident the_ Devil, _as subtle and as frightful as he is, has
acted the ridiculous and foolish Part, as much as most of God's
Creatures, and daily does so. And he cannot believe 'tis any Sin to
expose him for a foolish_ Devil, _as he is, or shew the World that he
may be laugh'd at._

_Those that think the Subject not handled with Gravity enough, have all
the Room given them in the World to handle it better; and as the Author
professes he is far from thinking his Piece perfect, they ought not to
be angry that_ he gives them leave to mend it. _He has had the
Satisfaction to please some Readers, and to see good Men approve it; and
for the rest, as my Lord_ Rochester _says in another Case,_

  He counts their Censure Fame.


_As for a certain Reverend Gentleman, who is pleased gravely to dislike
the Work_ (_he hopes, rather for the Author's sake than the_ Devil's)
_he only says,_ Let the Performance be how it will, and the Author what
he will, it is apparent he has not yet preach'd away all his Hearers.

_It is enough to me (says the Author) that the_ Devil _himself is not
pleased with my Work, and less with the Design of it; let the_ Devil
_and all his fellow Complainers stand on one side, and the honest, well
meaning, charitable World, who approve my Work, on the other, and I'll
tell Noses with_ Satan, _if he dares._

  THE
  HISTORY
  OF THE
  DEVIL, _&c._




CHAP. I.

_Being an Introduction to the whole Work._


I doubt not but the title of this book will amuse some of my reading
friends a little at first; they will make a pause, perhaps, as they do
at a witch's prayer, and be some time resolving whether they had best
look into it or no, lest they should really raise the _Devil_ by reading
his story.

Children and old women have told themselves so many frightful things _of
the Devil_, and have form'd ideas of him in their minds, in so many
horrible and monstrous shapes, that really it were enough to fright the
_Devil_ himself, to meet himself in the dark, dress'd up in the several
figures which imagination has form'd for him in the minds of men; and as
for themselves, I cannot think by any means that the _Devil_ would
terrify them half so much, if they were to converse face to face with
him.

It must certainly therefore be a most useful undertaking to give the
true history of this _Tyrant of the air_, this _God of the world_, this
terror and aversion of mankind, which we call _Devil_; to shew what he
IS, and what he IS NOT, where he IS, and where he IS NOT, when he is IN
US, and when he IS NOT; for I cannot doubt but that the _Devil_ is
really and _bona fide_ in a great many of our honest weak-headed
friends, when they themselves know nothing of the matter.

Nor is the work so difficult as some may imagine. The _Devil_'s
_history_ is not so hard to come at, as it seems to be; His original and
the first rise of his family is upon record, and as for his conduct, he
has acted indeed in the dark, as to method in many things; but _in
general_, as cunning as he is, he has been fool enough to expose himself
in some of the most considerable transactions of his Life, and has not
shewn himself a politician at all: Our old friend _Matchiavel_ outdid
him in many things, and I may in the process of this work give an
account of several of the sons of _Adam_, and some societies of 'em too,
who have out-witted _the Devil_, nay, who have out-sin'd _the Devil_,
and that I think may be call'd out-shooting him in his own bow.

It may perhaps be expected of me in this history, that since I seem
inclin'd to speak favourably of _Satan_, to do him justice, and to write
his story impartially, I should take some pains to tell you what
religion he is of; and even this part may not be so much a jest, as at
first sight you may take it to be; for _Satan_ has something of religion
in him, I assure you; nor is he such an unprofitable _Devil_ that way,
as some may suppose him to be; for tho', in reverence to my brethren, I
will not reckon him among the Clergy; No not so much as a gifted
Brother, yet I cannot deny, but that he often preaches, and if it be not
profitably to his hearers; 'tis as much their fault, as it is out of his
design.

It has indeed been suggested that he has taken orders, and that a
certain Pope, famous for being an extraordinary favourite of his, gave
him both institution and induction; but as this is not upon record, and
therefore we have no authentic document for the probation, I shall not
affirm it for a truth, for I would not slander the _Devil_.

It is said also, and I am apt to believe it, that he was very familiar
with that holy father Pope _Silvester_ II. and some charge him with
personating Pope _Hildebrand_ on an extraordinary occasion, and himself
sitting in the chair apostolick, in a full congregation; and you may
hear more of this hereafter: But as I do not meet with Pope _Diabolus_
among the list; in all father _Platina_'s lives of the Popes, so I am
willing to leave it as I find it.

But to speak to the point, and a nice point it is I acknowledge;
_namely_, what religion _the Devil_ is of; my answer will indeed be
general, yet not at all ambiguous, for I love to speak positively and
with undoubted evidence.

     1. _He is a believer._ And if in saying so it should follow, that
     even the _Devil_ has more religion than some of our men of fame can
     at this time be charged with, I hope my Lord ---- and his Grace the
     ---- of ---- and some of the upper class in the red-hot club, will
     not wear the coat, however well it may sit to their shapes, or
     challenge the Satyr, as if it were pointed at them, because 'tis
     due to them: In a word, whatever their Lordships are, I can assure
     them that the _Devil_ is no Infidel.

     2. _He fears God._ We have such abundant evidence of this in sacred
     History, that if I were not at present, in common with a few
     others, talking to an infidel sort of Gentlemen, with whom those
     remote things call'd Scriptures are not allow'd in evidence, I
     might say it was sufficiently prov'd; but I doubt not in the
     process of this undertaking to shew, that _the Devil_ really _fears
     God_, and that after another manner than ever he fear'd Saint
     _Frances_ or Saint _Dunstan_; and if that be proved, as I take upon
     me to advance, I shall leave it to judgment, who's the better
     Christian, _the Devil_ who _believes_ and _trembles_, or our modern
     gentry of ---- who believe neither _God nor Devil_.


Having thus brought the _Devil_ within the _Pale_, I shall leave him
among you for the present; not but that I may examine in its order who
has the best claim to his brotherhood, the Papists or the Protestants;
and among the latter the Lutherans or the Calvinists; and so descending
to all the several denominations of churches, see who has less of _the
Devil_ in them, and who more; and whether _less_ or _more_ the Devil has
not a seat in every synagogue, a pew in every church, a place in every
pulpit, and a vote in every synod; even from the Sanhedrim of the
_Jews_, to our friends at the _Bull and Mouth_, &c. from the greatest to
the least.

It will, I confess, come very much within the compass of this part of my
discourse, to give an account, _or at least make an essay toward it_, of
the share _the Devil_ has had in the spreading religion in the world;
and especially of dividing and subdividing opinions in religion;
perhaps, to eke it out and make it reach the farther; and also to shew
how far he is or has made himself a missionary of the famous clan _de
propaganda fide_; it is true, we find him heartily employ'd in almost
every corner of the world _ad propagandum errorem_: But that may require
a history by it self.

As to his propagating religion, 'tis a little hard indeed, at first
sight, to charge _the Devil_ with propagating religion, that is to say,
if we take it literally, and in the gross; but if you take it as the
_Scots_ insisted to take the oath of fidelity, _viz._ with an
_explanation_, it is plain _Satan_ has very often had a share in the
method, if not in the design of propagating the _christian faith_: For
example.

I think I do no injury at all to the Devil, to say that he had a great
hand in the old _holy war_, as it was ignorantly and enthusiastically
call'd; stirring up the christian princes and powers of _Europe_ to run
a madding after the _Turks_ and _Saracens_, and make war with those
innocent people above a thousand miles off, only because they entred
into God's heritage when he had forsaken it; graz'd upon his ground when
he had fairly turn'd it into a common, and laid it open for the next
comer; spending their nation's treasure, and embarking their kings and
people, (I say) in a war above a thousand miles off, filling their heads
with that religious madness, call'd, in those days, _holy zeal_ to
recover the _terra sancta_, the sepulchers of Christ and the Saints, and
as they call'd it falsly, the _holy city_, tho' true religion says it
was the accursed city, and not worth spending one drop of blood for.

This religious _Bubble_ was certainly of _Satan_, who, as he craftily
drew them in, so like a true _Devil_ he left them in the lurch when they
came there, fac'd about to the _Saracens_, animated the immortal
_Saladin_ against them, and manag'd so dexterously that he left the
bones of about thirteen or fourteen hundred thousand Christians there as
a trophy of his infernal politicks; and after the christian world had
run _a la santa terra_, or in _English_ a _saunt'ring_, about a hundred
year, he dropt it to play another game less foolish, but ten times
wickeder than that which went before it, _namely_, turning the crusadoes
of the Christians one against another; and, as _Hudibras_ said in
another case,

  "Made them fight like mad or drunk
  "For dame religion as for punk.


Of this you have a compleat account in the history of the Popes decrees
against the Count _de Thoulouse_, and the _Waldenses_ and _Albigenses_,
with the crusadoes and massacres which follow'd upon them, wherein to do
_the Devil_'s politicks some justice, he met with all the success he
could desire; the zealots of that day executed his infernal orders most
punctually, and planted religion in those countries in a glorious and
triumphant manner, upon the destruction of an infinite number of
innocent people, whose blood has fatten'd the soil for the growth of the
Catholick faith, in a manner very particular, and to Satan's full
satisfaction.

I might, to compleat this part of his history, give you the detail of
his progress in these first steps of his alliances with _Rome_; and add
a long list of massacres, wars, and expeditions in behalf of religion,
which he has had the honour to have a visible hand in; such as the
_Parisian_ massacre, the _Flemish_ war under the Duke _d' Alva_, the
_Smithfield_ fires in the _Marian days_ in _England_, and the massacres
in _Ireland_; all which would most effectually convince us that _the
Devil_ has not been idle in his business; but I may meet with these
again in my way, 'tis enough, while I am upon the generals only, to
mention them thus in a summary way; I say, 'tis enough to prove that
_the Devil_ has really been as much concerned as any body, in the
methods taken by some people for propagating the christian religion in
the world.

Some have rashly, and I had almost said maliciously charg'd _the Devil_
with the great triumphs of his friends the _Spaniards_ in _America_, and
would place the conquest of _Mexico_ and _Peru_ to the credit of his
account.

But I cannot join with them in this at all, I must say, I believe _the
Devil_ was innocent of that matter; my reason is, because, _Satan_ was
never such a fool as to spend his time, or his politicks, or embark his
allies to conquer nations who were already his own; that would be
_Satan_ against _Beelzebub_, making war upon himself, and at least doing
nothing to the purpose.

If they should charge him, indeed, with deluding _Philip_ II. of _Spain_
into that preposterous attempt call'd _the Armada_, (_anglice_, the
_Spanish Invasion_,) I should indeed more readily join with them; but
whether he did it weakly, in hope, _which was indeed not likely_, that
it should succeed; or wickedly, to destroy that great fleet of the
_Spaniards_, and draw them within the reach of his own dominions, the
elements; this being a question which authors differ exceedingly about,
I shall leave it to decide it self.

But the greatest piece of management, which we find _the Devil_ has
concern'd himself in of late, in the matter of religion, seems to be
that of the mission into _China_; and here indeed _Satan_ has acted his
master-piece: It was, no doubt, much for his service that _the Chineses_
should have no insight into matters of religion, I mean, that we call
christian; and therefore, tho' _Popery_ and the _Devil_ are not at so
much variance as some may imagine, yet he did not think it safe to let
the general system of Christianity be heard of among them in _China_.
Hence when the name of the christian religion had but been received with
some seeming approbation in the country of _Japan_, _Satan_ immediately,
as if alarm'd at the thing, and dreading what the consequence of it
might be, arm'd the _Japoneses_ against it with such fury, that they
expell'd it at once.

It was much safer to his designs, when, if the story be not a fiction,
he put that _Dutch_ witicism into the mouths of the States commanders,
when they came to _Japan_; who having more wit than to own themselves
Christians in such a place as that, when the question was put to them,
answered negatively, _That they were not_, but that _they were of
another religion call'd_ Hollanders.

However, it seems the diligent _Jesuits_ out-witted the Devil in
_China_, and, as I said above, over-shot him in his own Bow; for the
mission being in danger _by the Devil and the_ Chinese _Emperor_'s
_joining together_, of being wholly expell'd there too, as they had been
in _Japan_, they cunningly fell in with the ecclesiasticks of the
country, and joining the priestcraft of both religions together, they
brought _Jesus Christ_ and _Confucius_ to be so reconcilable, that the
_Chinese_ and the _Roman_ idolatry appeared capable of a confederacy, of
going on hand in hand together, and consequently of being very good
friends.

This was a master-piece indeed, and, _as they say_, almost frighted
_Satan_ out of his wits; but he being a ready manager, and particularly
famous for serving himself of the rogueries of the priests, fac'd about
immediately to the mission, and making a virtue of necessity, clapt in,
with all possible alacrity, with the proposal[1]; so the _Jesuits_ and
he form'd a _hotch-potch_ of _religion_ made up of _Popery_ and _Paganism_
and calculated to leave the latter rather worse than they found it,
binding the faith of Christ and the philosophy or morals of _Confucius_
together, and formally christening them by the name of _religion_; by
which means the politick interest of the mission was preserved; and yet
_Satan_ lost not one inch of ground with the _Chineses_, no, not by the
planting the Gospel it self, _such as it was_, among them.

Nor has it been such disadvantage to him that this plan or scheme of a
new modell'd religion would not go down at _Rome_, and that the
Inquisition damn'd it with Bell, Book and Candle; distance of place
serv'd his new allies, the missionaries, in the stead of a protection
from the Inquisition; and now and then a rich present well plac'd found
them friends in the congregation it self; and where any Nuncio with his
impudent zeal pretended to take such a long voyage to oppose them,
_Satan_ took care to get him sent back _re infecta_, or inspir'd the
million to move him off the premisses, by methods of their own (that is
to say, being interpreted) to _murther him_.

Thus the mission has in itself been truly _devilish_, and the Devil has
interested himself in the planting the christian religion in _China_.

The influence _the Devil_ has in the Politicks of mankind, is another
especial part of his history, and would require, if it were possible, a
very exact description; but here we shall necessarily be obliged to
inquire so nicely into the Arcana of circumstances, and unlock the
cabinets of state in so many courts, canvass the councils of ministers
and the conduct of princes so fully, and expose them so much, that it
may, perhaps, make a combustion among the great politicians abroad; and
in doing that we may come so near home too, that tho' personal safety
and prudentials forbid our medling with our own country, we may be taken
in a double entendre, and fall unpitied for being only suspected of
touching truths that are so tender, whether we are guilty or no; on
these accounts I must meddle the less with that part, at least for the
present.

Be it that the Devil has had a share in some of the late councils of
_Europe_, influencing them this way or that way, to his own advantage,
what is it to us? For example, What if he has had any concern in the
late affair of _Thorn_? What need we put it upon him, seeing his
confederates the _Jesuites_ with the _Assessorial_ tribunal of _Poland_
take it upon themselves? I shall leave that part to the issue of time. I
wish it were as easy to persuade the world that he had no hand in
bringing the injur'd Protestants to leave the justice due to the cries
of protestant blood to the arbitrament of a popish power, who dare say
that _the Devil_ must be in it, if justice should be obtain'd that way:
I should rather say, _the Devil_ is in it, or else it would never be
expected.

It occurs next to enquire from the premisses, whether _the Devil_ has
more influence or less in the affairs of the world now, than he had in
former ages; and this will depend upon comparing, as we go along, his
methods and way of working in past times, and the modern politicks by
which he acts in our days; with the differing reception which he has met
with among the men of such distant ages.

But there is so much to enquire of about _the Devil_, before we can
bring his story down to our modern times, that we must for the present
let them drop, and look a little back to the remoter parts of this
history; drawing his picture that people may know him when they meet
him, and see who and what he is, and what he has been doing ever since
he got leave to act in the high station he now appears in.

In the mean time, if I might obtain leave to present an humble petition
to _Satan_, it should be, that he would according to modern usage oblige
us all, with writing _the history of his own times_; 'twould, as well as
one that is gone before it, be a Devilish good one; for as to the
sincerity of the performance, the authority of the particulars, the
justice of the characters, _&c._ if they were no better vouch'd, no more
consistent with themselves, with charity, with truth, and with the
honour of an historian, than the last of that kind which came abroad
among us, it must be a reproach to _the Devil_ himself to be the author
of it.

Were _Satan_ to be brought under the least obligation to write truth,
and that the matters of fact, which he should write, might be depended
upon, he is certainly qualified by his knowledge of things to be a
compleat historian; nor could the Bishop himself, _who, by the way, has
given us already the Devil of a history_, come up to him: _Milton_'s
_Pandemonium_, tho' an excellent dramatick performance, would appear a
meer trifling sing-song business, beneath the dignity of _Chevy-chase_:
The _Devil_ could give us a true account of all the civil wars in
Heaven; how and by whom, and in what manner he lost the day there, and
was oblig'd to quit the field: The fiction of his refusing to
acknowledge and submit to the _Messiah_, upon his being declar'd
Generalissimo of the Heavenly forces, which Satan expected himself, as
the eldest officer; and his not being able to brook another to be put in
over his head; I say, that fine-spun thought of Mr. _Milton_ would
appear to be strain'd too far, and only serve to convince us that he
(_Milton_) knew nothing of the matter. _Satan_ knows very well, that the
_Messiah_ was not _declared to be the Son of God with power_ till by and
after _the resurrection from the dead_, and that all power was then
given him _in Heaven and earth_, and not before; so that _Satan_'s
rebellion must derive from other causes, and upon other occasions, as he
himself can doubtless give us an account, if he thinks fit, and of which
we shall speak further in this work.

What a fine History might this old Gentleman write of the Antediluvian
world, and of all the weighty affairs, as well of state as of religion,
which happen'd during the fifteen hundred years of the patriarchal
administration!

Who, like him, could give a full and compleat account of the Deluge,
whether it was a meer vindictive, a blast from Heaven, wrought by a
supernatural power in the way of miracle? or whether, according to Mr.
_Burnet_'s _Theory_, it was a consequence following antecedent causes by
the meer necessity of nature; seen in constitution, natural position,
and unavoidable working of things, as by the Theory publish'd by that
learn'd enthusiast it seems to be?

_Satan_ could easily account for all the difficulties of the _Theory_,
and tell us whether, as there was a natural necessity of the Deluge,
there is not the like necessity and natural tendency to a Conflagration
at last.

Would _the Devil_ exert himself as an Historian, for our improvement and
diversion, how glorious an account could he give us of _Noah_'s Voyage
round the world, in the famous Ark! he could resolve all the
difficulties about the building it, the furnishing it, and the laying up
provision in it for all the collection of kinds that he had made; He
could tell us whether all the creatures came voluntier to him to go into
the ark, or whether he went a hunting for several years before, in order
to bring them together.

He could give us a true relation how he wheedled the people of the next
world into the absurd ridiculous undertaking of building a _Babel_; how
far that stupendous stair-case, which was in imagination to reach up to
Heaven, was carried, before it was interrupted and the builders
confounded; how their speech was alter'd, how many Tongues it was
divided into, or whether they were divided at all; and how many
subdivisions or dialects have been made since that, by which means very
few of God's creatures, except the Brutes, understand one another, or
care one farthing whether they do or no.

In all these things _Satan_, who, no doubt, would make a very good
chronologist, could settle every Epocha, correct every Calendar, and
bring all our accounts of time to a general agreement; as well the
_Grecian Olympiads_, the _Turkish Heghira_, the _Chinese_ fictitious
account of the world's duration, as our blind _Julian_ and _Gregorian_
accounts, which have put the world, to this day, into such confusion,
that we neither agree in our holy-days or working days, fasts or feasts,
nor keep the same sabbaths in any part of the same globe.

This great Antiquary could bring us to a certainty in all the
difficulties of ancient story, and tell us whether the tale of the siege
of _Troy_, and the rape of _Helen_ was a fable of _Homer_ or a history;
whether the fictions of the Poets are form'd from their own brain, or
founded in facts; and whether letters were invented by _Cadmus_ the
_Phoenician_, or dictated immediately from _Heaven_ at mount _Sinai_.

Nay, he could tell us how and in what manner he wheedled _Eve_, deluded
_Adam_, put _Cain_ into a passion, till he made him murther his own
brother; and made _Noah_, who was above 500 years a preacher of
righteousness, turn Sot in his old age, dishonour all his ministry,
debauch himself with wine, and by getting drunk and exposing himself,
become the jest and laughing-stock of his children, and of all his
posterity to this day.

And would Satan, according to the modern practice of the late right
reverend Historian, enter into the characters of the great men of his
age, how should we be diverted with the just history of _Adam_, in
paradise and out of it; his character, and how he behaved at and after
his expulsion; how _Cain_ wandered in the land of _Nod_, what the mark
was which _God_ set upon him, whose daughter his wife was, and how big
the city was he built there, according to a certain Poet of noble
extraction,

  How _Cain_ in the land of _Nod_
    When the rascal was alone
  Like an owl in an ivy tod
    Built a city as big as _Roan_.

  _Roch._


He could have certainly drawn _Eve_'s picture, told us every feature in
her face, and every inch in her shape, whether she was a perfect beauty
or no, and whether with the fall she did grow crooked, ugly, ill-natur'd
and a scold; as the learned _Valdemar_ suggests to be the effects of the
curse.

Descending to the character of the Patriarchs in that age, he might, no
doubt, give us in particular the characters of _Belus_, worship'd under
the name of _Baal_; with _Satan_, and _Jupiter_, his successors; who
they were here, and how they behaved; with all the _Pharaohs_ of
_Egypt_, the _Abimilechs_ of _Canaan_, and the great monarchs of
_Assyria_ and _Babylon_.

Hence also he is able to write the lives of all the Heroes of the world,
from _Alexander_ of _Macedon_ to _Lewis_ the XIV. and from _Augustus_ to
the great King _George_; nor could the Bishop himself go beyond him for
flattery, any more than the Devil himself could go beyond the Bishop for
falshood.

I could enlarge with a particular satisfaction upon the many fine things
which _Satan_, rummaging his inexhaustible storehouse of slander, could
set down to blacken the characters of good men, and load the best
Princes of the world with infamy and reproach.

But we shall never prevail with him, I doubt, to do mankind so much
service, as resolving all those difficulties would be; for he has an
indelible grudge against us; as he believes, and perhaps is assur'd that
men were at first created by his sovereign, to the intent that after a
certain state of Probation in life, such of them as shall be approved,
are appointed to fill up those vacancies in the Heavenly Host, which
were made by the abdication and expulsion of him (_the Devil_) and his
Angels; so that man is appointed to come in _Satan_'s stead, to make
good the breach, and enjoy all those ineffable Joys and Beatitudes which
_Satan_ enjoy'd before his fall; no wonder then, that _the Devil_ swells
with envy and rage at mankind in general, and at the best of them in
particular; nay, the granting this point is giving an unanswerable
reason, why the _Devil_ practises with such unwearied and indefatigable
application upon the best men, if possible, to disappoint GOD
Almighty's decree, and that he should not find enough among the whole
Race, to be proper subjects of his clemency, and qualified to succeed
_the Devil_ and his host, or fill up the places vacant by the Fall. It
is true indeed, _the Devil_, who we have reason to say is no fool, ought
to know better than to suppose that if he should seduce the whole race
of mankind, and make them as bad as himself, he could, by that success
of his wickedness, thwart or disappoint the determined purposes of
Heaven; but that those which are appointed to inherit the Thrones, which
he and his followers abdicated, and were deposed from, shall certainly
be preserv'd in spite of his Devices for that inheritance, and shall
have the possession secur'd to them, notwithstanding all that _the
Devil_ and all the Host of _Hell_ can do to prevent it.

But, however he knows the certainty of this, and that when he endeavours
the seducing the chosen servants of the most High, he fights against GOD
himself, struggles with irresistible grace, and makes war with infinite
power; undermining the church of God, and that faith in him which is
fortified with the eternal promises of Jesus Christ, that the gates of
_Hell_, that is to say, the _Devil_ and all his power, shall not prevail
against them; I say, however he knows the impossibility there is that he
should obtain his ends, yet so blind is his rage, so infatuate his
wisdom, that he cannot refrain breaking himself to pieces against this
mountain, and splitting against the rock. _qui Jupiter vult perdere hos
dementat._

But to leave this serious part, which is a little too solemn, for the
account of this rebel; seeing we are not to expect he will write his own
History for our information and diversion, I shall see if I cannot write
it for him: In order to this, I shall extract the substance of his
whole story, from the beginning to our own times, which I shall collect
out of what is come to hand, whether by revelation or inspiration,
that's nothing to him; I shall take care so to improve my intelligence,
as may make my account of him authentick, and, _in a word_, such as the
Devil himself shall not be able to contradict.

In writing this uncouth story I shall be freed from the censures of the
Criticks, in a more than ordinary manner, upon one account especially;
(_viz._) that my story shall be so just and so well grounded, and, after
all the good things I shall say of _Satan_, will be so little to his
satisfaction, that _the Devil_ himself will not be able to say, I _dealt
with the Devil_ in writing it: I might, perhaps, give you some account
where I had my intelligence, and how all the Arcana of his management
have come to my hands; _but pardon me, Gentlemen_, this would be to
betray conversation, and to discover my agents, and you know statesmen
are very careful to preserve the correspondences they keep in the
enemy's country, lest they expose their friends to the resentment of the
Power whose councils they betray.

Besides, the learned tell us, that ministers of state make an excellent
plea of their not betraying their intelligence, against all party
inquiries into the great sums of money pretended to be paid for _secret
service_; and whether the secret service was to bribe people to betray
things abroad or at home; whether the money was paid to some body or to
no body, employ'd to establish correspondences abroad, or to establish
families and amass treasure at home; in a word, whether it was to serve
their country or serve themselves, it has been the same thing, and the
same plea has been their protection: Likewise in the important affair
which I am upon, 'tis hoped you will not desire me to betray my
Correspondents; for you know _Satan_ is naturally cruel and malicious,
and who knows what he might do to shew his resentment? at least it might
endanger a stop of our intelligence for the future.

And yet, before I have done, I shall make it very plain, that however my
information may be secret and difficult, that yet I came very honestly
by it, and shall make a very good use of it; for 'tis a great mistake in
those who think that an acquaintance with the affairs of _the Devil_ may
not be made very useful to us all: They that know no evil can know no
good; and, as the learned tell us, that a stone taken out of the head of
a Toad is a good antidote against poison; so a competent knowledge of
_the Devil_, and all his ways, may be the best help to make us defie
_the Devil_ and all his _works_.




CHAP. II.

_Of the word_ DEVIL, _as it is a proper name to the Devil, and any or all
     his host, Angels,_ &c.


It is a question, not yet determined by the learned, whether the word
_Devil_ be a _singular_, that is to say, the _name_ of a person standing
by himself, or a _noun of multitude_; if it be a singular, and so must
be used personally only as _a proper name_, it consequently implies one
imperial _Devil_, Monarch or King of the whole clan of Hell; justly
distinguish'd by the term THE DEVIL, or as the _Scots_ call him, _the
muckle horn'd Dee'l_, or as others in a wilder dialect, _the Devil of
Hell_, that is to say, the _Devil_ of a _Devil_; or (better still) as
the Scripture expresses it, by way of emphasis, the _great red Dragon_,
the _Devil_ and _Satan_.

But if we take this word to be, as above, _a noun of multitude_, and so
to be used _ambo-dexter_, as occasion presents, singular or plural; then
_the Devil_ signifies _Satan_ by himself, or _Satan with all his
Legions_ at his heels, as you please, more or less; and this way of
understanding the word, as it may be very convenient for my purpose, in
the account I am now to give of the infernal Powers, so it is not
altogether improper in the nature of the thing: It is thus express'd in
Scripture, where the person possess'd _Matt._ iv. 24. is first said to
be possess'd of _the Devil_ (singular) and our Saviour asks him, as
speaking to a single person, _what is thy name?_ and is answer'd in the
plural and singular together, my name is LEGION, for _we are many_.

Nor will it be any wrong to _the Devil_, supposing him a single person,
seeing entitling him to the conduct of all his inferior Agents, is what
he will take rather for an addition to his infernal glory, than a
diminution or lessening of him in the extent of his Fame.

Having thus articl'd with the _Devil_ for liberty of speech, I shall
talk of him sometimes in the singular, as a person, and sometimes in the
plural, as an host of _Devils_ or of infernal Spirits, just as occasion
requires, and as the history of his affairs makes necessary.

But before I enter upon any part of his history, the nature of the thing
calls me back, and my Lord B---- of ---- in his late famous orations in
defence of liberty, summons me to prove that there is such a thing or
such a person as _the Devil_; and in short, unless I can give some
evidence of his existence, as my Lord ---- said very well, I am talking
of _nobody_.

D--m me, Sir, says a graceless comrade of his to a great man, _your
Grace_ will go to _the Devil_.

D--m ye, Sir, says the D----, then I shall go _no where_; I wonder where
you intend to go?

Nay, to _the D----l_ too I doubt, _says Graceless_, for I am almost as
wicked as my _Lord Duke_.

_D._ Thou ar't a silly empty Dog, says the D--, and if there is such a
place as _a Hell_, tho' I believe nothing of it, 'tis a place for fools,
such as thou art.

_Gr._ I wonder then, what Heaven the great wits go to, such as my _Lord
Duke_; I don't care to go there, let it be where it will; they are a
tiresome kind of people, there's no bearing them, they'll make _a Hell_
wherever they come.

_D._ Prithee hold thy fool's tongue, I tell thee, if there is any such
place as we call NO WHERE; that's all the Heaven or Hell that I know of,
or believe any thing about.

_Gr._ Very good, my Lord--; so that _Heaven_ is _no where_, and
_Hell_ is _no where_, and the _Devil_ is _nobody_, according to my _Lord
Duke_!

_D._ Yes Sir, and what then?

_Gr._ And you are to go _no where_ when you die, are you?

_D._ Yes, you Dog, don't you know what that incomparable noble genius my
Lord _Rochester_ sings upon the subject, I believe it unfeignedly,

  After death nothing is,
    And nothing death.

_Gr._ You believe it, my Lord, you mean, you would fain believe it if
you could; but since you put that great genius my Lord _Rochester_ upon
me, let me play him back upon _your Grace_; I am sure you have read his
fine poem upon _nothing_, in one of the stanzas of which is this
beautiful thought,

  And to be part of [2] thee
    The wicked wisely pray.

_D._ You are a foolish Dog.

_Gr._ And my _Lord Duke_ is a wise Infidel.

_D._ Why? is it not wiser to believe _no Devil_, than to be always
terrify'd at him?

_Gr._ But shall I toss another Poet upon you, my Lord?

  If it should so fall out, as who can tell
  But there may be a GOD, a _Heaven_ and _Hell_?
  Mankind had best consider well, for fear
  'T should be too late when their mistakes appear.

_D._ D--m your foolish Poet, that's not my Lord _Rochester_.

_Gr._ But how must I be damn'd, if there's _no Devil_? Is not _your
Grace_ a little inconsistent there? My Lord _Rochester_ would not have
said that, and't please your Grace.

_D._ No, _you Dog_, I am not inconsistent at all, and if I had the
ordering of you, I'd make you sensible of it; I'd make you think your
self damn'd for want of _a Devil_.

_Gr._ That's like one of _your Grace_'s paradoxes, such as when you
swore _by God_ that you did not believe there was any such thing as _a
God_, or _Devil_; so you swear by _nothing_, and damn me to _no where_.

_D._ You are a critical Dog, who taught you to believe these solemn
trifles? who taught you to say there is a GOD?

_Gr._ Nay, I had a better school-master than my _Lord Duke_.

_D._ Why, who was your school-master pray?

_Gr._ _The Devil_, and't please your _Grace_.

_D._ The Devil! _the Devil he did?_ what you're going to quote
Scripture, are you? Prithee don't tell me of _Scripture_, I know what
you mean, _the Devils believe and tremble_; why then I have the
whip-hand of _the Devil_, for I hate trembling; and I am deliver'd from
it effectually, for I never believed any thing of it, and therefore I
don't tremble.

_Gr._ And there, indeed, I am a wickeder creature than the _Devil_, or
even than my _Lord Duke_, for I believe, and yet don't tremble neither.

_D._ Nay, if you are come to your penitentials I have done with you.

_Gr._ And I think I must have done with my _Lord Duke_, for the same
reason.

_D._ _Ay, ay_, pray do, I'll go and enjoy my self; I won't throw away
the pleasure of my life, I know the consequence of it.

_Gr._ And I'll go and reform my self, else I know the consequence too.

This short Dialogue happen'd between two men of quality, and both men of
wit too; and the effect was, that the Lord brought the reality of _the
Devil_ into the question, and the debate brought the profligate to be a
penitent; so in short, _the Devil_ was made a preacher of repentance.

The Truth is, _God_ and _the Devil_, however opposite in their nature,
and remote from one another in their place of abiding, seem to stand
pretty much upon a level in our faith: For as to our believing the
reality of their existence, he that denies one, generally denies both;
and he that believes one, necessarily believes both.

Very few, if any of those who believe there is a GOD, and acknowledge
the debt of homage which mankind owes to the supreme Governor of the
World, doubt the existence of _the Devil_, except here and there one,
whom we call practical Atheists; and 'tis the character of an Atheist,
if there is such a creature on Earth, that like my _Lord Duke_, he
believes neither GOD or _Devil_.

As the belief of both these stands upon a level, and that GOD and the
_Devil_ seem to have an equal share in our faith, so the evidence of
their existence seems to stand upon a level too, in many things; and as
they are known by their Works in the same particular cases, so they are
discover'd after the same manner of demonstration.

Nay, in some respects 'tis equally criminal to deny the reality of them
both, only with this difference, that to believe the existence of a GOD
is a debt to nature, and to believe the existence of _the Devil_ is a
like debt to reason; one is a demonstration from the reality of visible
causes, and the other a deduction from the like reality of their
effects.

One demonstration of the existence of GOD, is from the universal
well-guided consent of all nations to worship and adore a supreme Power;
One demonstration of the existence of the _Devil_, is from the avow'd
ill-guided consent of some nations, who knowing no other GOD, make a GOD
of the _Devil_, for want of a better.

It may be true, that those nations have no other Ideas of the Devil than
as of a superior Power; if they thought him a supreme Power it would
have other effects on them, and they would submit to and worship him
with a different kind of fear.

But 'tis plain they have right notions of him as a Devil or evil Spirit,
because the best reason, and in some places the only reason they give
for worshiping him is, that he may do them no hurt; having no notions at
all of his having any power, much less any inclination to do them good;
so that indeed they make a meer _Devil_ of him, at the same time that
they bow to him as to a GOD.

All the ages of Paganism in the World have had this notion of _the
Devil_: indeed in some parts of the World they had also some Deities
which they honour'd above him, as being supposed to be beneficent, kind
and inclined, as well as capable to give them good things; for this
reason the more polite Heathens, such as the _Grecians_ and the
_Romans_, had their _Lares_ or houshold Gods, whom they paid a
particular respect to; as being their Protectors from Hobgoblins, Ghosts
of the Dead, evil Spirits, frightful Appearances, evil Genius's and
other noxious Beings from the invisible World; or to put it into the
language of the day we live in, from _the Devil_, in whatever shape or
appearance he might come to them, and from whatever might hurt them: and
what was all this but setting up _Devils_ against _Devils_, supplicating
one _Devil_ under the notion of a good Spirit, to drive out and protect
them from another, whom they call'd a bad Spirit, the white _Devil_
against the black _Devil_?

This proceeds from the natural notions mankind necessarily entertain of
things to come; _superior_ or _inferior_, GOD and the _Devil_, fill up
all futurity in our thoughts; and 'tis impossible for us to form any
images in our minds of an immortality and an invisible World, but under
the notions of perfect felicity, or extreme misery.

Now as these two respect the Eternal state of man after life, they are
respectively the object of our reverence and affection, or of our
horror and aversion; but notwithstanding they are plac'd thus in a
diametrical opposition in our affections and passions, they are on an
evident level as to the certainty of their existence, and, as I said
above, bear an equal share in our faith.

It being then as certain that there is _a Devil_, as that there is _a
God_, I must from this time forward admit no more doubt of his
existence, nor take any more pains to convince you of it; but speaking
of him as a reality in Being, proceed to enquire who he is, and from
whence, in order to enter directly into the detail of his History.

Now not to enter into all the metaphysical trumpery of his Schools, nor
wholly to confine my self to the language of the Pulpit; where we are
told, that to think of GOD and of the _Devil_, we must endeavour first
to form Ideas of those things which illustrate the description of
rewards and punishments; in the one the eternal presence of the highest
good, and, as a necessary attendant, the most perfect, consummate,
durable bliss and felicity, springing from the presence of that Being in
whom all possible Beatitude is inexpressibly present, and that in the
highest perfection: On the contrary, to conceive of a sublime fallen
Arch-angel, attended with an innumerable host of degenerate, rebel
Seraphs or Angels cast out of Heaven together; all guilty of
inexpressible rebellion, and all suffering from that time, and to suffer
for ever the eternal vengeance of the Almighty, in an inconceivable
manner; that his presence, tho' blessed in it self, is to them the most
compleat article of terror; That they are in themselves perfectly
miserable; and to be with whom for ever, adds an inexpressible misery to
any state as well as place; and fills the minds of those who are to be,
or expect to be banish'd to them with inconceivable horror and
amazement.

But when you have gone over all this, and a great deal more of the like,
tho' less intelligible language, which the passions of men collect to
amuse one another with; you have said nothing if you omit the main
article, namely, the personality of _the Devil_; and till you add to all
the rest some description of the company with whom all this is to be
suffer'd, _viz._ the _Devil and his Angels_.

Now who this _Devil and his Angels_ are, what share they have either
actively or passively in the eternal miseries of a future state, how far
they are Agents in or Partners with the sufferings of the place, is a
difficulty yet not fully discover'd scend to you by the divine Right of Birth and Blood?

_Cain._ But what does all that signify to me, while God appears to
favour and caress my younger Brother, and to shine upon him, while a
black Dejection and token of Displeasure surrounds me every Day, and he
does not appear to me as he used to do?

_D._ And what need your Majesty be concern'd at that, if it be so? if he
does not appear pleased, you have the whole World to enjoy your self in,
and all your numerous and rising Posterity Adore and Honour you; what
need those remote Things be any disturbance to you?

_Cain._ How! my Children, not the Favour of God be valued! yes, yes, in
his favour is Life; what can all the World avail without the Smiles and
Countenance of him that made it?

_D._ Doubtless, Sir, he that made the World and plac'd you at the Head
of it all, to govern and direct it, has made it agreeable, and it is
able to give you a full Satisfaction and Enjoyment, if you please to
consider it well, tho' you were never to converse with him all the while
you live in't.

_Cain._ You are _quite wrong_ there, my Children, _quite wrong_.

_D._ But do you not, great Sir, see all your Children as well as us
rejoicing in the Plenty of all Things, and are they not compleatly
happy, and yet they know little of this great GOD? He seldom converses
among us, we hear of him indeed by your sage Advices, and we bring our
Offerings to you for him, as you direct, and when that's done, we enjoy
whatever our Hearts desire; and so doubtless may you in an abundant
manner, if you please.

_Cain._ But your Felicity is wrong plac'd then, or you suppose that God
is pleased and satisfied in that your Offerings are brought to me; but
what would you say, if you knew that God is displeased? that he does not
accept your Offerings? that when I sacrific'd to him in behalf of you
all, he rejected my Offerings, tho' I brought a princely Gift, being of
the finest of the Wheat, the choicest and earliest Fruits, and the
sweetest of the Oil, an Offering suited to the Giver of them all?

_D._ But if you offered them, Sir, how are you sure they were not
accepted?

_Cain._ Yes, yes, I am sure; did not my Brother _Abel_ offer at the same
Time a Lamb of his Flock, for he, you know, delights in Cattle, and
covers the Mountains with his Herds? over him, all the while he was
sacrificing, a bright Emanation shone chearing and enlivening; a Pledge
of Favour, and light ambient Flames play'd hovering in the lower Air, as
if attending his Sacrifice; and when ready prepar'd, immediately
descended and burnt up the Flesh, a Sweet odoriferous Savour ascending
to him, who thus testified his Acceptance; whereas, over my Head a black
Cloud, misty, and distilling Vapour, hung dripping upon the humble Altar
I had raised, and wetting the finest and choicest Things I had
prepar'd, spoil'd and defac'd them; the Wood unapt to burn by the
Moisture which fell, scarce receiv'd the Fire I brought to kindle it,
and even then, rather smother'd and choaked, than kindled into a Flame;
in a Word, it went quite out, without consuming what was brought to be
offer'd up.

_D._ Let not our truly reverenc'd Lord and Father be disquieted at all
this; if he accepts not what you bring, you are discharg'd of the Debt,
and need bring no more; nor have the Trouble of such labour'd
Collections of Rarities any more; when he thinks fit to require it
again, you will have Notice, no Question, and then it being call'd for,
will be accepted or else why should it be requir'd?

_Cain._ That may indeed be the Case, nor do I think of attempting any
more to bring an Offering, for I rather take it, that I am forbidden for
the present; but then, what is it that my younger Brother Triumphs in?
and how am I insulted, in that he and his House are all Joy and Triumph,
as if they had some great Advantage over me, in that their Offering was
accepted when mine was not?

_D._ Does he Triumph over your Majesty, our Lord and Sovereign? give us
but your Order, and we will go and pull him and all his Generation in
pieces; for to triumph over you who are his elder Brother, is a horrid
Rebellion and Treason, and he ought to be expell'd the Society of
Mankind.

_Cain._ I think so too, indeed; however, my dear Children and faithful
Subjects, tho' I accept your Offer of Duty and Service, yet I will
consider very well, before I take up Arms against my Brother; besides,
our Sovereign Father and patriarchal Lord, _Adam_, being yet alive, it
is not in my Right to act offensively without his Command.

_D._ We are ready therefore to carry your Petition to him, and doubt not
to obtain his Licence and Commission too, to empower you to do your self
Justice upon your younger Brother; who being your Vassal, or at least
inferior, as he is junior in Birth, insults you upon the fancied Opinion
of having a larger Share in the Divine Favour, and receiving a Blessing
on his Sacrifices, on Pretence of the same Favour being denied you.

_Cain._ I am content, go then, and give a just Account of the State of
our Affairs.

_D._ We shall soon return with the agreeable answer; let not our Lord
and Father continue sad and dejected, but depend upon a speedy Relief,
by the Assistance of thy numerous Issue, all devoted to thy Interest and
Felicity.

_Cain._ My Blessing be with you in your Way, and give you a favourable
Reception at the venerable Tent of our universal Lord and Father.

       *       *       *       *       *

Note, Here the cursed Race being fully given up to the Direction of the
Evil-Spirit, which so early possess'd them, and swelling with Rage at
the innocent _Abel_ and his whole Family, they resolved upon forming a
most wicked and detestable lie, to bring about the Advice which they had
already given their Father _Cain_ a touch of; and to pretend that _Adam_
being justly provok'd at the undutiful Behaviour of _Abel_, had given
_Cain_ a Commission to chastise him, and by Force to cut him off and
all his Family, as guilty of Rebellion and Pride.

Fill'd with this mischievous and bloody Resolution, they came back to
their Father _Cain_, after staying a few Days, such as were Sufficient
to make _Cain_ believe they had been at the spacious Plains, where
_Adam_ dwelt; the same which are now call'd the blessed Valleys, or the
Plains of _Mecca_ in _Arabia Fælix_, near the Banks of the _Red-Sea_.

Note here also, that _Cain_ having received a wicked Hint from these
Men, his Children and Subjects, as before, intimating that _Abel_ had
broken the Laws of Primogeniture in his Behaviour towards him, (_Cain_)
and that he might be justly punish'd for it; Satan, that cunning Manager
of all our wayward Passions, fan'd the Fire of Envy and Jealousy with
his utmost Skill all the while his other Agents were absent; and by the
Time they came back had blown it up into such a Heat of Fury and Rage,
that it wanted nothing but Air to make it burn out, as it soon
afterwards did in a furious Flame of Wrath and Revenge, even to Blood
and Destruction.

Just in the very critical Moment, while Things stood thus with _Cain_,
Satan brings in his wicked Instruments, as if just arriv'd with the
Return of his Message from _Adam_, at whose Court they had been for
Orders; and thus they, that is the _Devil_ assuming to speak by them,
approach their Father with an Air of solemn but chearful Satisfaction at
the Success of their Embassy.

       *       *       *       *       *

_D._ Hail Sovereign, Reverend, Patriarchal Lord! we come with Joy to
render thee an Account of the Success of our Message.

_Cain._ Have you then seen the venerable Tents where dwell the
Heaven-born, the Angelic Pair, to whom all human Reverence highly due,
is and ought always to be humbly paid?

_D._ We have.

_Cain._ Did you, together with my grand Request, a just, a humble Homage
for me pay, to the great Sire and Mother of Mankind?

_D._ We did.

_Cain._ Did you in humble Language represent the Griefs and Anguish
which oppress my Soul?

_D._ We did, and back their Blessing to thee bring.

_Cain._ I hope with humblest Signs of filial Duty you took it for me on
your bending Knees?

_D._ We did, and had our Share; the Patriarch lifting his Hands to
Heaven express'd his Joy to see his spreading Race, and bless'd us all.

_Cain._ Did you my solemn Message too deliver, my Injuries impartially
lay down, and due Assistance and Direction crave?

_D._ We did.

_Cain._ What spoke the Oracle? he's God to me; what just Command d'ye
bring, what's to be done? am I to bear the insulting Junior's Rage? and
meekly suffer what unjustly he, affronting Primogeniture and Laws of God
and Man, imposes by his Pride unsufferable! Am I to be crush'd, and be
no more the firstborn Son on Earth, but bow and kneel to him?

_D._ Forbid it Heaven! as _Adam_ too forbids, who with a justice
God-like and peculiar to injur'd Parents, _Abel_'s Pride resents, and
gives his high Command to thee to punish.

_Cain._ To punish? say you, did he use the Word, the very Word? am I
commission'd then to punish _Abel_?

_D._ Not _Abel_ only, but his rebel Race, as they alike in Crime alike
are join'd in Punishment.

_Cain._ The Race indeed have shar'd the Merit with him; how did they all
insult, and with a Shout of Triumph mock my Sorrow, when they saw me
from my Sacrifice dejected come, as if my Disappointment was their Joy?

_D._ This too the venerable Prince resents, and to preserve the Race in
Bounds of Laws subordinate and limited to Duty, Commands that this first
Breach be not pass'd by, lest the Precedent upon Record stand to future
Times to encourage like Rebellion.

_Cain._ And is it then my Sovereign Parent's Will?

_D._ It is his Will, that thou his eldest Son, his Image, his belov'd,
should be maintain'd in all the Rights of Sovereignty deriv'd to thee
from him; and not be left expos'd to injury and Power usurped, but
should do thy self Justice on the rebel Race.

_Cain._ And so I will; _Abel_ shall quickly know what 'tis to trample on
his elder Brother; shall know that he's thus sentenc'd by his Father,
and I'm commission'd but to execute his high Command, his Sentence,
which is God's, and that he falls by the Hand of Heavenly Justice.

       *       *       *       *       *

So now Satan had done his Work, he had deluded the Mother to a Breach
against the first and only Command, he had drawn _Adam_ to the same
Snare, and now he brings in _Cain_ prompted by his own Rage, and deluded
by his, (Satan's,) Craft, to commit Murder, nay a Fratricide, an
aggravated Murther.

Upon this he sends out _Cain_, while the bloody Rage was in its Ferment,
and wickedly at the same Time bringing _Abel_, innocent and fearing no
ill, just in his Way, he suggests to his Thoughts such Words as these.

Look you _Cain_, see how Divine Justice concurs with your Father's
righteous Sentence, see there's thy Brother _Abel_ directed by Heaven to
fall into thy Hands unarm'd, unguarded, that thou may'st do thy self
Justice upon him without Fear; see thou may'st kill him, and if thou
hast a Mind to conceal it, no Eyes can see, or will the World ever know
it, so that no Resentment or Revenge upon thee, or thy Posterity, can be
apprehended, but it may be said some wild Beast had rent him; nor will
any one suggest that thou, his Brother, and Superior, could possibly be
the Person.

_Cain_ prepar'd for the Fact, by his former avow'd Rage and Resolution
of Revenge, was so much the less prepar'd to avoid the Snare thus
artfully contriv'd by the Master of all Subtilty, the _Devil_; so he
immediately runs upon his Brother _Abel_, and after a little unarm'd
Resistance, the innocent poor Man expecting no such Mischief, was
conquer'd and murther'd; after which, as is to be supposed, the
exasperated Crew of _Cain_'s outrageous Race, over-run all his Family
and Houshold, killing Man, Woman and Child.

It is objected here that we have no Authority in Scripture to prove this
Part of the Story; but I answer, 'tis not likely but that _Abel_, as
well as _Cain_, being at Man's Estate long before this, had several
Children by their own Sisters, for they were the only Men in the World
who were allow'd the Marrying their own Sisters, there being no other
Women then in the World; and as we never read of any of _Abel_'s
Posterity, 'tis likewise as probable they were all murther'd, as that
they should kill _Abel_ only, whose Sons might immediately fall upon
_Cain_ for the Blood of their Father, and so the World have been
involv'd in a Civil War as soon as there were two Families in it.

But be it so or not, 'tis not doubted the Devil wrought with _Cain_ in
the horrid Murther, or he had never done it; whether it was directly or
by Agents is not material, nor is the Latter unlikely; and if the
Latter, then there is no Improbability in the Story, for why might not
he that made Use of the Serpent to tempt _Eve_, be as well supposed to
make a Tool of some of _Cain_'s Sons or Grandsons to prompt him in the
wicked Attempt of murthering his Brother? and why must we be oblig'd to
bring in a Miracle or an Apparition into the Story, to make it probable
that the _Devil_ had any Hand in it, when 'twas so natural to a
degenerate Race to act in such a Manner?

However it was, and by whatever Tool the _Devil_ wrought, 'tis certain
that this was the Consequence, poor _Abel_ was butcher'd, and thus the
_Devil_ made a second Conquest in God's Creation; for _Adam_ was now, as
may be said, really Childless, for his two Sons were thus far lost,
_Abel_ was killed, and _Cain_ was curst and driven out from the Presence
of the Lord, and his Race blasted with him.

It would be a useful enquiry here, and worthy our giving an Account of,
could we come to a Certainty in it, namely, what was the Mark that God
set upon _Cain_, by which he was kept from being fallen upon by _Abel_'s
Friends or Relations? but as this does not belong to the _Devil_'s
History, and it was God's Mark, not the _Devil_'s, I have nothing to do
with it here.

The _Devil_ had now gain'd his Point, the Kingdom of Grace, so newly
erected, had been as it were extinct without a new Creation, had not
_Adam_ and _Eve_ been alive, and had not _Eve_, tho' now 130 Years of
Age, been a breeding young Lady, for we must suppose the Woman, in that
State of Longevity, bare Children till they were seven or eight hundred
Year old: This Teeming of _Eve_ peopled not the World so much as it
restored the blessed Race; for tho' _Abel_ was kill'd _Cain_ had a
numerous Offspring presently, which had _Seth_, (_Adam_'s third Son)
never been born, would soon have replenish'd the World with People, such
as they were; the Seed of a Murtherer, cursed of God, branded with a
Mark of Infamy, and who afterwards fell all together in the universal
Ruine of the Race by the Deluge.

But after the Murther of _Abel_, _Adam_ had another Son born, namely,
_Seth_, the Father of _Enos_, and indeed the Father of the holy Race;
for during his Time and his Son _Enos_, the Text says that Men began to
call on the Name of the Lord; that is to say, they began to look back
upon _Cain_ and his wicked Race, and being convinc'd of the Wickedness
they had committed, and led their whole Posterity into, they began to
sue to Heaven for Pardon of what was past, and to lead a new sort of
Life.

But the _Devil_ had met with too much Success in his first Attempts, not
to go on with his general Resolution of debauching the Minds of Men, and
bringing them off from God; and therefore as he kept his Hold upon
_Cain_'s cursed Race, embroil'd already in Blood and Murther; so he
proceeded with his degenerate Offspring, till in a Word he brought both
the holy Seed and the degenerate Race to joyn in one universal Consent
of Crime, and to go on in it with such aggravating Circumstances, as
that it repented the Lord that he had made Man, and he resolv'd to
overwhelm them again with a general Destruction, and clear the World of
them.

The Succession of Blood in the royal original Line of _Adam_, is
preserv'd in the sacred Histories and brought down as low as _Noah_ and
his three Sons, for a continu'd series of 1450 Years, say some, 1640
say others; in which Time Sin spread it self so generally thro' the
whole Race, and _the Sons of God_, so the Scripture calls the Men of the
righteous Seed, the Progeny of _Seth_, came in unto the _Daughters of
Men_, that is, join'd themselves to the curs'd Race of _Cain_, and
married promiscuously with them, according to their Fancies, the Women
it seems being beautiful and tempting; and tho' the Devil could not make
the Women handsome or ugly in one or other Families, yet he might work
up the Gust of wicked Inclination on either Side, so as to make both the
Men and Women tempting and agreeable to one another, where they ought
not to have been so; and perhaps, as it is often seen to this Day, the
more tempting for being under legal Restraint.

It is objected here, that we do not find in the Scripture that the Men
and Women of either Race were at that Time forbidden intermarrying with
one another; and it is true, that literally it is not forbid; but if we
did not search rather to make doubts than to explain them, we might
suppose it was forbidden by some particular Command at that Time; seeing
we may reasonably allow every Thing to be forbidden, which they are
tax'd with a Crime in committing; and as the Sons of God taking them
Wives as they thought fit to choose, tho' from among the Daughters of
the cursed Race, is there charg'd upon them as a general Depravation,
and a great Crime; and for which, 'tis said, GOD even repented that he
had made them, we need go no farther to satisfy our selves that it was
certainly forbidden.

_Satan_ no doubt too had a Hand in this Wickedness; for as it was his
Business to prompt Men to do every Thing which God had prohibited, so
the Reason given why the Men of those Days did this Thing was, they saw
the Daughters of Men, that is of the wicked Race or forbidden Sort,
_were fair_, he tempted them by the Lust of the Eye; in a word, the
Ladies were beautiful and agreeable, and the _Devil_ knew how to make
use of the Allurement; the Men liked and took them by the meer Direction
of their Fancy and Appetite, without regarding the supreme Prohibition;
_They took them Wives of all which they chose_, or such as they lik'd to
choose.

But the Text adds, that this promiscuous Generation went farther than
the meer outward Crime of it, for it shew'd that the Wickedness of the
Heart of Man was great before God, and that he resented it; In short,
God perceived a Degeneracy or Defect of Virtue had seiz'd upon the whole
Race, that there was a general Corruption of Manners, a Depravity of
Nature upon them, that even the holy Seed was tainted with it, that the
Devil had broken in upon them, and prevail'd to a great Degree; that not
only the Practice of the Age was corrupt, for that God could easily have
restrain'd, but that the very Heart of Man was debauch'd, his Desires
wholly vitiated, and his Senses engag'd in it; so that in a Word, it
became necessary to shew the divine Displeasure, not in the ordinary
Manner, by Judgment and Reproofs of such kind as usually reclaim Men,
but by a general Destruction to sweep them away, clear the Earth of
them, and put an End to the Wickedness at once, removing the Offence and
the Offenders all together; this is signify'd at large, Gen. vi. 5. _God
saw that the Wickedness of Man was great in the Earth, and that every
Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continually._ And
again ver. 11, 12. _The Earth also was corrupt before God; and the
Earth was fill'd with Violence. And God look'd upon the Earth and
behold it was corrupt; for all Flesh had corrupted his Way upon the
Earth._

It must be confess'd it was a strange Conquest the _Devil_ had made in
the Antediluvian World, that he had, as I may say, brought the whole
Race of Mankind into a general Revolt from God; _Noah_ was indeed a
Preacher of Righteousness, and he had preach'd about 500 Years to as
little Purpose as most of the good Ministers ever did; for we do not
read there was one Man converted by him, or at least not one of them
left, for that at the Deluge there was either none of them alive, or
none spar'd but _Noah_ and his three Sons, and their Wives; and even
they are ('tis evident) recorded, not so much to be sav'd for their own
Goodness, but because they were his Sons; Nay, without Breach of Charity
we may conclude, that at least one went to the _Devil_ even of those
three, namely, _Ham_ or _Cham_ for triumphing in a brutal Manner over
his Father's Drunkenness; for we find the Special Curse reach'd to him
and his Posterity for many Ages; and whether it went no farther than the
present State of Life with them, we cannot tell.

We will suppose now that thro' this whole 1500 Years the Devil having so
effectually debauch'd Mankind, had advanc'd his infernal Kingdom to a
prodigious Height; for the Text says, _the whole Earth was fill'd with
violence_; in a Word, Blood, Murder, Rape, Robbery, Oppression and
Injustice prevail'd every where, and Man, like the wild Bear in the
Forest, liv'd by Prey, biting and devouring one another.

At this Time _Noah_ begins to preach a new Doctrine to them, for as he
had before been a Preacher of Righteousness, now he becomes a Preacher
of Vengeance; first he tells them they shall be all overwhelm'd with a
Deluge, that for their Sins God repented they were made, and that
he would destroy them all, adding, that to prevent the Ruin of himself
and Family, he resolv'd to build him a Ship to have recourse to when the
Water should come over the Rest of the World.

What Jesting, what Scorn, what Contempt did this Work expose the good
old Man to for above a 100 Years? for so long the Work was building, as
antient Authors say; let us represent to our selves in the most lively
Manner how the witty World at that Time behav'd to poor old _Noah_; how
they took their Evening Walks to see what he was doing, and passed their
Judgment upon it, and upon the Progress of it; I say, to represent this
to our selves, we need go no farther than to our own Witicisms upon
Religion, and upon the most solemn Mysteries of Divine Worship; how we
damn the Serious for Enthusiasts, think the Grave mad, and the Sober
melancholy; call Religion it self Flatus and Hyppo; make the Devout
ignorant, the Divine mercenary, and the whole Scheme of Divinity a Frame
of Priestcraft; and thus no doubt the building an Ark or Boat, or
whatever they call'd it, to float over the Mountains, and dance over the
Plains, what could it be but a religious Frenzy, and the Man that so
busied himself, a Lunatick? and all this in an Age when divine Things
came by immediate Revelation into the Minds of Men! the _Devil_ must
therefore have made a strange Conquest upon Mankind to obliterate all
the Reverence, which but a little before was so strangely impress'd upon
them concerning their Maker.

This was certainly the Height of the _Devil_'s Kingdom, and we shall
never find him arrive to such a Pitch again; he was then truly and
literally the universal Monarch, nay the God of this World; and as all
Tyrants do, he governs them with an arbitrary absolute sway; and had not
God thought fit to give him a Writ of Ejectment, and afterwards drown
him out of Possession I know not what would have been the Case, he might
have kept his Hold for ought I know till the Seed of the Woman came to
bruise his Head, that is to say, cripple his Government, Dethrone him
and Depose his Power, as has been fulfill'd in the Messiah.

But as he was, I say, drown'd out of the World, his Kingdom for the
present was at an End; at least, if he had a Dominion he had no
Subjects, and as the Creation was in a Manner renewed, so the _Devil_
had all his Work to do over again: Unhappy Man! how has he, by his weak
Resistance, made the _Devil_, recovering his Hold too easy to him, and
given him all the Advantages, except as before excepted, which he had
before? Now whether he retired in the mean Time, and how he got footing
again after _Noah_ and his Family were landed upon the New Surface, that
we come next to enquire.




CHAP. X.

_Of the Devil's second Kingdom, and how he got footing in the renew'd
     World by his Victory over_ Noah _and his Race_.


The Story of _Noah_, his building the Ark, his embarking himself and all
Nature's Stock for a new World on board it; the long Voyage they took,
and the bad Weather they met with, tho' it would embellish this Work
very well, and come in very much to the Purpose in this Place, yet as
it does not belong to the _Devil_'s Story, for I cannot prove what some
suggest (_viz._) that he was in the Ark among the Rest, I say, for that
Reason I must omit it.

And now having mention'd Satan's being in the Ark; as I say, I cannot
prove it, so there are, I think, some good Reasons to believe he was not
there: _First_, I know no Business he had there; _secondly_, we read of
no Mischief done there, and these joyn'd together make me conclude he
was absent; the last I chiefly insist upon, that we read of no Mischief
done there, which if he had been in the Ark, would certainly have
happen'd; and therefore I suppose rather, that when he saw his Kingdom
dissolv'd, his Subjects all ingulph'd in an inevitable Ruin and
Desolation, a Sight suitable enough to him, except as it might unking
him for a Time; _I say_, when he saw this, he took care to speed himself
away as well as he could, and make his Retreat to a Place of Safety,
where that was, is no more difficult to us, than it was to him.

It is suggested that as he is Prince of the Power of the Air, he retired
only into that Region. It is most rational to suppose he went no further
on many Accounts, of which I shall speak by and by: Here he stay'd
hovering in the Earth's Atmosphere, as he has often done since, and
perhaps now does; or if the Atmosphere of this Globe was affected by the
Indraft of the Absorption, as some think, then he kept himself upon the
Watch, to see what the Event of the new Phænomenon would be, and this
Watch, wherever it was, I doubt not, was as near the Earth as he could
place himself, perhaps in the Atmosphere of the Moon, or in a Word, the
next Place of Retreat he could find.

From hence I took upon me to insist, that _Satan_ has not a more certain
Knowledge of Events than we; I say, he has not a _more certain
Knowledge_; that he may be able to make stronger Conjectures and more
rational Conclusions from that he sees, I will not deny; and that which
he most outdoes us in is, that he sees more to conclude from than we
can, but I am satisfied he knows nothing of Futurity more than we can
see by Observation and Inference; nor, _for Example_, did he know
whether God would repeople the World any more or no.

I must therefore allow that he only waited to see what would be the
Event of this strange Eruption of Water, and what God propos'd to do
with the Ark, and all that was in it.

Some Philosophers tell us, besides what I hinted above, that the _Devil_
could have no Retreat in the Earth's Atmosphere, for that the Air being
wholly condens'd into Water, and having continually pour'd down its
Streams to deluge the Earth, that Body was become so small, and had
suffer'd such Convulsions, that there was but just enough Air left to
surround the Water, or as might serve by its Pressure to preserve the
natural Position of Things, and supply the Creatures in the Ark with a
Part to breath in.

The Atmosphere indeed might suffer some strange and unnatural Motions at
that Time, but not (I believe) to that Degree, however, I will not
affirm that there could be room in it, or is now for the Devil, much
less for all the numberless Legions of Satan's Host; but there was, and
now certainly is, sufficient Space to receive him, and a sufficient Body
of his Troops for the Business he had for them at that time, and that's
enough to the Purpose; or if the Earth's Atmosphere did suffer any
particular Convulsion on that Occasion, he might make his Retreat to
the Atmosphere of the Moon, or of _Mars_, or of _Venus_, or of any of
the other Planets; or to any other Place, for he that is Prince of the
Air could not want Retreats in such a Case, from whence he might watch
for the issue of Things; certainly he did not go far, because his
Business lay here, and he never goes out of his Way of doing Mischief.

In particular, his more than ordinary Concern was, to see what would
become of the Ark; he was wise enough doubtless to see, that GOD, who
had directed its making, nay even the very Structure of it, would
certainly take Care of it, preserve it upon the Water, and bring it to
some Place of Safety or other; tho' where it should be, the _Devil_ with
all his Cunning could not resolve, whether on the same Surface the
Waters drawing off, or in any other created or to be created Place; and
this State of Uncertainty being evidently his Case, and which proves his
Ignorance of Futurity, it was his Business, _I say_, to watch with the
utmost vigilance for the Event.

If the Ark was (as Mr. _Burnet_ thinks) guided by two Angels, they not
only held it from foundering or being swallow'd up in the Water, but
certainly kept the Waters calm about it, especially when the Lord
brought a strong Wind to blow over the whole Globe, which by the Way was
the first, and, I suppose, the only universal Storm that ever blew, for
to be sure it blew over the whole Surface at once; I say, if it was thus
guided, to be sure the _Devil_ saw it, and that with Envy and Regret
that he could do it no Injury, for doubtless had it been in the Devil's
Power, as God had drown'd the whole Race of Man, except what was in the
Ark, he would have taken care to have dispatch'd them too, and so made
an End of the Creation at once; but either he was not empower'd to go
to the Ark, or it was so well guarded by Angels, that when he came near
it he could do it no harm: So it rested at length, the Waters abating on
the Mountains of _Arrarat_ in _Armenia_, or some where else that Way,
and where they say a Piece of the Keel is remaining to this Day; of
which, however with Dr. ------ I say, I believe not one Word.

The Ark being safe landed, 'tis reasonable to believe _Noah_ prepared to
go on Shore, as the Seamen call it, as soon as the dry Land began to
appear; and here you must allow me to suppose Satan, tho' himself
cloth'd with a Cloud, so as not to be seen, came immediately, and
pearching on the Roof, saw all the Heaven-kept Houshold safely landed,
and all the Host of living Creatures dispersing themselves down the
Sides of the Mountain, as the Search of their Food or other proper
Occasions directed them.

This Sight was enough; Satan was at no Loss to conclude from hence that
the Design of God was to repeople the World by the Way of ordinary
Generation, from the Posterity of these eight Persons, without creating
any new Species.

Very well, says the _Devil_, then my Advantage over them, by the Snare I
laid for poor _Eve_, is good still; and I am now just where I was after
_Adam_'s Expulsion from the Garden, and when I had _Cain_ and his Race
to go to work with; for here is the old expung'd Corrupted Race still,
as _Cain_ was the Object then, so _Noah_ is my Man now, and if I do not
master him one way or another, I am mistaken in my Mark. _Pardon me for
making a Speech for_ the Devil.

_Noah_ big with a Sense of his late Condition, and while the Wonders of
the Deluge were fresh in his Mind, spent his first Days in the Extasies
of his Soul, giving Thanks, and praising the Power that had been his
Protection, in and thro' the Flood of Waters, and which had in so
miraculous a Manner, safely landed him on the Surface of the newly
discover'd Land; and the Text tells us, as one of the first Things he
was employ'd in, _He built an Altar unto the Lord, and offered
Burnt-Offerings upon the Altar_. Gen. viii. 20.

While _Noah_ was thus employ'd he was safe, the _Devil_ himself could no
where break in upon him; and we may suppose very reasonably, as he found
the old Father invulnerable, he left him for some Years, watching
notwithstanding all possible Advantages against his Sons and their
Children; for now the Family began to encrease, and _Noah_'s Sons had
several Children; whether himself had any more Children after the Flood
or not, that we are not arriv'd to any Certainty about.

Among his Sons the _Devil_ found _Japhet_ and _Shem_, good, pious,
religious, and very devout Persons; serving God daily, after the Example
of their good old Father _Noah_, and he could make nothing of them or of
any of their Posterity; but _Ham_ the second, or according to some, the
younger Son of _Noah_, had a Son who was nam'd _Canaan_, a loose young
profligate Fellow, his Education was probably but cursory and
superficial, his Father _Ham_ not being near so religious and serious a
Man as his Brothers _Shem_ and _Japhet_ were; and as _Canaan_'s
Education was defective, so he prov'd, as untaught Youth generally do, a
wild, and in short a very wicked Fellow, and consequently a fit Tool for
the _Devil_ to go to work with.

_Noah_, a diligent industrious Man, being with all his Family thus
planted in the rich fruitful Plains of _Armenia_, or wherever you
please, let it be near the Mountains of _Caucasus_ or _Arrarat_; went
immediately to work, cultivating and improving the Soil, encreasing his
Cattle and Pastures, sowing Corn, and among other Things planting Trees
for Food, and among the Fruit Trees he planted Vines, of the Grapes
thereof he made no doubt, as they still in the same Country do make,
most excellent Wine, rich, luscious, strong, and pleasant.

I cannot come into the Notion of our Criticks, who to excuse _Noah_ from
the guilt of what followed, or at least from the Censure, tell us, he
knew not the Strength or the Nature of Wine, but that gathering the
heavy Clusters of the Grapes, and their own weight crushing out their
balmy Juices into his Hand, he tasted the tempting Liquor, and that the
_Devil_ assisting he was charm'd with the delicious Fragrance, and
tasted again and again, pressing it out into a Bowl or Dish, that he
might take a larger Quantity; till at length the heady Froth ascended
and seizing his Brain, he became intoxicate and drunk, not in the least
imagining there was any such Strength in the Juice of that excellent
Fruit.

But to make out this Story, which is indeed very favourable for _Noah_,
but in it self extremely ridiculous, you must necessarily fall into some
Absurdities, and beg the Question most egregiously in some particular
Cases, which way of arguing will by no means suppose what is suggested;
at first you must support there was no such Thing as Wine made before
the Deluge, and that no Body had been ever made drunk with the Juice of
the Grape before _Noah_, which, I say, is begging the Question in the
grossest Manner.

If the Contrary is true, as I see no Reason to question, if, _I say_, it
was true that there was Wine drank, and that Men were or had been drunk
with it before, they cannot then but suppose that _Noah_, who was a
wise, a great and a good Man, and _a Preacher of Righteousness_, both
knew of it, and without doubt had in his preaching against their Crimes,
preach'd against this among the rest, upbraided them with it, reprov'd
them for it, and exhorted them against it.

_Again_, 'tis highly probable they had Grapes growing, and consequently
Wines made from them, in the Antediluvian World, how else did _Noah_
come by the Vines which he planted? For we are to suppose, he could
plant no Trees or Shrubs, but such as he found the Roots of in the
Earth, and which no doubt had been there before in their highest
Perfection, and had consequently grown up and brought forth the same
luscious Fruit before.

Besides, as he found the Roots of the Vines, so he understood what they
were, and what Fruit they bore, or else it may be supposed also he would
not have planted them; for he planted them for their Fruit, as he did it
in the Provision he was making for his Subsistence, and the Subsistence
of his Family: and if he did not know what they were, he would not have
set them, for he was not planting for Diversion but for Profit.

Upon the whole it seems plain to me he knew what he did, as well when he
planted the Vines as when he pressed out the Grapes; and also when he
drank the Juice that he knew it was Wine, was strong and would make him
drunk if he took enough of it: He knew that other Men had been drunk
with such Liquor before the Flood, and that he had reprehended them for
it; and therefore it was not his Ignorance, but the _Devil_ took him at
some Advantage, when his Appetite was eager, or he thirsty, and the
Liquor cooling and pleasant; and in short, as _Eve_ said, _the Serpent
beguilded her_, and she DID EAT, so the Devil beguiled _Noah_, and _he_
DID DRINK; the Temptation was too strong for _Noah_, not the Wine; he
knew well enough what he did, but as the Drunkards say to this Day, it
was so good he could not forbear it, and so he got drunk before he was
aware; or as our ordinary Speech expresses it, _he was overtaken with
drink_; and Mr. _Pool_ and other Expositors are partly of the same Mind.

No sooner was the poor old Man conquer'd, and the Wine had lighten'd his
Head, but it may be supposed he falls off from the Chair or Bench where
he sate, and tumbling backward his Clothes, which in those hot Countries
were only loose open Robes, like the Vests which the _Armenians_ wear to
this Day, flying abroad, or the _Devil_ so assisting on purpose to
expose him, he lay there in a naked indecent Posture not fit to be seen.

In this juncture who should come by but young _Canaan_, say some; or as
others think, this young Fellow first attack'd him by way of Kindness
and pretended Affection; prompted his Grandfather to drink, on Pretence
of the Wine being good for him, and proper for the Support of his old
Age, and subtilly set upon him, drinking also with him, and so (his Head
being too strong for the old Man's) drank him down, and then, _Devil_
like, triumph'd over him; boasted of his Conquest, insulted the Body as
it were dead, uncovered him on purpose to expose him, and leaving him in
that indecent Posture, went and made Sport with it to his Father _Ham_,
who in that Part, wicked like himself, did the same to his Brethren
_Japhet_ and _Shem_; but they like modest and good Men, far from
carrying on the wicked Insult on their Parent, went and cover'd him, as
the Scripture expresses it, and as may be supposed inform'd him how he
had been abus'd, and by whom.

Why else should _Noah_, when he came to himself, shew his Resentment so
much against _Canaan_ his Grandson, rather than against _Ham_ his
Father, and who 'tis supposed in the Story the guilt chiefly lay upon?
we see the Curse is (as it were) laid wholly upon _Canaan_ the Grandson,
and not a Word of the Father is mention'd, Gen. ix. 25, 26, 27, _Cursed
be_ Canaan, _a Servant of Servants shall he be_, &c.

That _Ham_ was Guilty, that's certain from the History of Fact, but I
cannot but suppose his Grandson was the Occasion of it; and in this Case
the Devil seems to have made _Canaan_ the Instrument or Tool to delude
_Noah_, and draw him in to Drunkenness, as he made the Serpent the Tool
to beguile _Eve_, and draw her into Disobedience.

Possibly _Canaan_ might do it without Design at first, but might be
brought in to ridicule and make a Jest of the old Patriarch afterward,
as is too frequent since in the Practice of our Days; but I rather
believe he did it really with a wicked Design, and on Purpose to expose
and insult his Reverend old Parent; and this seems more likely too,
because of the great Bitterness with which _Noah_ resented it, after he
came to be inform'd of it.

But be that as it will, the _Devil_ certainly made a great Conquest
here, and as to outward Appearance no less than that which he gain'd
before over _Adam_; nor did the _Devil_'s Victory consist barely in his
having drawn in the only righteous Man of the whole Antediluvian World,
and so beginning or initiating the new young Progeny with a Crime; but
here was the great Oracle silenc'd at once; the Preacher of
Righteousness, for such no doubt he would have been to the new World, as
he was to the old, I say, the Preacher was turn'd out of Office, or his
Mouth stopt, which was worse; nay, it was a stopping of his Mouth in the
worst kind, far worse than stopping his Breath, for had he died, the
Office had descended to his sons _Shem_ and _Japhet_, but he was dead to
the Office of an Instructor, tho' alive as to his Being; For of what
Force could his Preachings be, who had thus fallen himself into the most
shameful and beastly Excess?

Besides some are of the Opinion, tho' I hope without Ground, that _Noah_
was not only overtaken once in his Drink, but that being fallen into
that Sin it became habitual, and he continued in it a great while, and
that it was this which is the meaning of his being uncovered in his
Tent, and that his Son saw his Nakedness; that is, he continually
exposed himself for a long Time, a hundred Years, say they, and that his
Son _Ham_, and his Grandson _Canaan_ having drawn him into it, kept him
in it, encourag'd and prompted it, and all the while Satan still
prompting them, join'd their Scoffs and contempt of him, with their
wicked Endeavours to promote the Wickedness; and both with as much
Success as the Devil himself could wish for.

Then as for his two Sons modestly and decently covering their Father,
they tell us, that Represents _Shem_ and _Japhet_ applying themselves in
an humble and dutiful Manner to their Father, to entreat and beseech him
to consider his ancient Glory, his own pious Exhortations to the late
drowned World, and to consider the Offence which he gave by his evil
Courses to God, and the Scandal to his whole Family, and also that they
are brought in effectually prevailing upon him; and that then _Noah_
cursed the Wickedness of _Ham_'s degenerate Race, in Testimony of his
sincere Repentance after the Fact.

The Story is not so very unlikely as it is certain that it is not to be
proved, and therefore we had better take it as we find it (_viz._) for
one single Act; but suppose it was so, 'tis still certain that _Noah_'s
Preaching was sadly interrupted, the Energy of his Words flatter'd, and
the Force of his Persuasions enervated and abated, by this shameful
Fall; that he was effectually silenc'd for an Instructor ever after, and
this was as much as the Devil had Occasion for; and therefore indeed we
read little more of him, except that he lived three hundred and fifty
Years after the Flood; nay, we do not so much as read that he had any
more Children, but the contrary, nor indeed could _Noah_ have any more
Children, except by his old and perhaps super-annuated Wife, who it was
very likely he had had four or five hundred Year, unless you will
suppose he was allow'd to marry some of his own Progeny, Daughters or
Grandaughters, which we do not suppose was allow'd, no not to _Adam_
himself.

This was certainly a Master-piece of the _Devil_'s Policy, and a fatal
Instance of his unhappy Diligence, (_viz._) that the Door of the Ark was
no sooner open, and the Face of the World hardly dry from the universal
Destruction of Mankind, but he was at work among them; and that not only
to form a general Defection among the Race, upon the Foot of the
original Taint of Nature, but like a bold _Devil_ he strikes at the very
Root, and flies at the next general Representative of Mankind, attacks
the Head of the Family, that in his Miscarriage the Rise and Progress of
a Reformation of the new World should receive an early Check, and should
be at once prevented; I say, like a bold Devil, he strikes at the Root,
and _alas!_ poor unhappy _Noah_, he proved too weak for him, _Satan_
prevail'd in his very first Attempt, and got the Victory over him at
once.

_Noah_ thus overcome, and Satan's Conquest carried on to the utmost of
his own Wishes, the _Devil_ had little more to do in the World for some
Ages, than to carry on an universal Degeneracy among Mankind, and to
finish it by a like diligent Application, in deluding the Generality of
the Race, and them as they came on gradually into Life; this he found
the less difficult, because of the first Defection which spread like a
Contagion upon the Earth immediately after.

The first Evidence we have of his Success in this mischievous Design was
in the Building that great stupendious Stair-case, for such it seems it
was intended, call'd _Babel_, which if the whole World had not been
drunk, or otherwise infatuated, they would never have undertaken; even
Satan himself could never have prevail'd with them to undertake such a
preposterous Piece of Work, for it had neither End or Means, Possibility
or Probability in it.

I must confess I am sometimes apt to vindicate our old Ancestors, in my
Thoughts, from the Charge it self, as we generally understand it,
namely, that they really design'd to build a Tower which should reach up
to Heaven, or that it should secure them in case of another Flood; and
Father _Casaubon_ is of my Opinion, whether I am of his or no, is a
Question by it self; his opinion is that the Confusion was nothing but a
Breach among the Undertakers and Directors of the Work, and that the
Building was design'd chiefly for a Store-house for Provisions, in Case
of a second Deluge; as to their Notion of its reaching up to Heaven, he
takes the Expression to be allegorical rather than little, and only to
mean that it should be exceeding high; perhaps they might not be
Astronomers enough to measure the Distance of Space between the Earth
and Heaven, as we pretend to do now; but as _Noah_ was then alive, and
as we believe all his three Sons were so too, they were able to have
inform'd them how absurd it was to suppose either the one or the other
(_viz_.) (1.) that they could build up to Heaven, or (2.) that they
could build firm enough to resist, or high enough to overtop the Waters,
supposing such another Flood should happen; I would rather think it was
only that they intended to build a most glorious and magnificent City,
where they might all inhabit together; and that this Tower was to be
built for Ornament and also for Strength, or as above, and for a
Store-house to lay up vast Magazines of Provisions, in Case of
extraordinary Floods or other Events, the City being built in a great
Plain, namely, the Plains of _Shimar_ near the River _Euphrates_.

But the Story, as it is recorded, suits better with Satan's Measures at
that Time; and as he was from the Beginning prompting them to every
Thing that was contrary to the Happiness of Man, so the more
preposterous it was, and the more inconsistent with common Sense, the
more to his Purpose; and it shew'd the more what a compleat Conquest he
had gain'd over the Reason as well as the Religion of Mankind at that
Time.

Again, 'tis evident in this Case, they were not only acting contrary to
the Nature of Things, but contrary to the Design and to the Command of
Heaven; for God's Command was that they should replenish the Earth, that
is, that they should spread their Habitations over it, and People the
whole Globe; whereas they were pitching in one Place, as if they were
not to multiply sufficient to take up any more.

But what car'd the Devil for that, or to put it a little handsomer, that
was what _Satan_ aimed at; for it was enough to him, to bring Mankind
to act just contrary to what _Heaven_ had directed or commanded them in
any thing, and if possible in every Thing.

But God himself put a stop to this foolish Piece of Work, and it was
time indeed to do so, for a madder thing the Devil himself never
proposed to them; I say, God himself put a stop to this new Undertaking,
and disappointed the Devil; and how was it done? not in Judgment and
Anger, as perhaps the Devil expected and hop'd for, but as pitying the
Simplicity of that dreaming Creature Man, he confused their Speech, or
as some say, divided and confused their Councils, so that they could not
agree with one another, which would be the same Thing as not to
understand one another; or he put a new Shibboleth upon their Tongues,
thereby separating them into Tribes or Families, for by this every
Family found themselves under a Necessity of keeping together, and this
naturally encreased that Differing Jargons of Language, for at first it
might be no more.

What a Confusion this was to them we all know, by their being oblig'd to
leave off their building, and immediately separating one from another;
but what a Surprize it was to the old Serpent, that remains to be
considered of, for indeed it belongs to his History.

Satan had never met with any Disappointment in all his wicked Attempts
till now; for first, he succeeded even to triumph upon _Eve_, he did the
like upon _Cain_, and in short upon the whole World, _one Man_ (Noah)
_excepted_; when he blended the Sons of God, and the Daughters of Hell,
for so the Word is understood, together, in promiscuous voluptuous
Living as well as Generation.

As to the Deluge, Authors are not agreed whether it was a Disappointment
to the Devil or no, it might be indeed a Surprize to him, for tho'
_Noah_ had preach'd of it for a hundred Year together, yet as he
(_Satan_) daily prompted the People not to heed or believe what that old
Fellow _Noah_ said to them, and to ridicule his whimsical Building a
monstrous Tub to swim or float in, when the said Deluge should come; so
I am of the Opinion he did not believe it himself, and am positive he
could not foresee it, by any insight into Futurity that he was Master
of.

'Tis true the Astronomers tell us, there was a very terrible Comet seen
in the Air, that it appeared for 180 Days before the Flood continually;
and that as it approach'd nearer and nearer every Day all the while, so
that at last it burst and fell down in a continual Spout or Stream of
Water, being of a watry Substance, and the Quantity so g)
half an Hour before the Time appointed, lest the King's Mind should
alter, and his Heart fail him.

If the Story be not made upon him, (for we should not slander the
_Devil_) it should seem, he was not thoroughly satisfied in King
_Charles_ IX.'s Steadiness in his Cause; for the King, it seems, had
relax'd a little once before, and Satan might be afraid he would fall
off again, and so prevent the Execution: Others say, the King did relent
immediately after the ringing the _Alarm-Bell_, but that then it was too
late, the Work was begun, and the Rage of Blood having been let loose
among the People, there was no recalling the Order. If the _Devil_ was
thus brought to the Necessity of a secret Management, it must be owned
he did it dexterously; but I have not Authority enough for the Story, to
charge him with the Particulars, so I leave it _au croc._

I have much better Vouchers for the Story following, which I had so
solemnly confirm'd by one that liv'd in the Family, that I never doubted
the Truth of it. There liv'd, in the Parish of St. _Bennet Fynk_, near
the _Royal Exchange_, an honest poor Widow Woman, who, _her Husband
being lately dead_, took Lodgers into her House; that is, she let out
some of her Rooms in order to lessen her own Charge of Rent; among the
rest, she let her Garrets to a working Watchwheel-maker, or one some way
concern'd in making the Movements of Watches, and who work'd to those
Shop-keepers who sell Watches; as is usual.

It happened that a Man and Woman went up, to speak with this
Movement-maker upon some Business which related to his Trade, and when
they were near the Top of the Stairs, the Garret-Door where he usually
worked being wide open, they saw the poor Man (the Watch-maker, or
Wheel-maker) had hang'd himself upon a Beam which was left open in the
Room a little lower than the Plaister, or Ceiling: Surpriz'd at the
Sight, the Woman stop'd, and cried out to the Man who was behind her on
the Stairs that he should run up, and cut the poor Creature down.

At that very Moment comes a Man hastily from another Part of the Room
which they upon the Stairs could not see, bringing a Joint-Stool in his
Hand, as if in great Haste, and sets it down just by the Wretch that was
hang'd, and getting up as hastily upon it pulls a Knife out of his
Pocket, and taking hold of the Rope with one of his Hands, beckon'd to
the Woman and the Man behind her with his Head, as if to stop and not
come up, shewing them the Knife in his other Hand, as if he was just
going to cut the poor Man down.

Upon this, the Woman stopp'd a while, but the Man who stood on the
Joint-Stool continued with his Hand and Knife as if fumbling at the
Knot, but did not yet cut the Man down; at which the Woman cried out
again, and the Man behind her call'd to her. Go up, _says he_, and help
the Man upon the Stool! supposing something hindred. But the Man upon
the Stool made Signs to them again to be quiet, and not come on, as if
saying, I shall do it immediately; then he made two Strokes with his
Knife, as if cutting the Rope, and then stopp'd again; and still the
poor Man was hanging, and consequently dying: Upon this, the Woman on
the Stairs cried out to him. What ails you? Why don't you cut the poor
Man down? And the Man behind her, having no more Patience, thrusts her
by, and said to her. Let me come, I'll warrant you I'll do it; and with
that runs up and forward into the Room to the Man; but when he came
there, behold, the poor Man was there hanging; but no Man with a Knife,
or Joint-Stool, or any such thing to be seen, all that was Spectre and
Delusion, in order, no doubt, to let the poor Creature that had hang'd
himself perish and expire.

The Man was so frighted and surpriz'd, that with all the Courage he had
before, he drop'd on the Floor as one dead, and the Woman at last was
fain to cut the poor Man down with a Pair of Scissars, and had much to
do to effect it.

As I have no room to doubt the Truth of this Story, which I had from
Persons on whose Honesty I could depend. So I think it needs very little
Trouble to convince us who the Man upon the Stool must be, and that it
was the _Devil_ who plac'd himself there in order to finish the Murther
of the Man who he had, _Devil_-like, tempted before, and prevail'd with
to be his own Executioner. Besides, it corresponds so well with the
_Devil_'s Nature, and with his Business, _viz._ that of a _Murtherer_,
that I never question'd it; nor can I think we wrong the _Devil_ at all
to charge him with it.

     _N. B._ I cannot be positive in the remaining Part of this Story,
        _viz._ whether the Man was cut down soon enough to be recover'd,
        or whether the _Devil_ carry'd his Point, and kept off the Man and
        Woman till it was too late; but be it which it will, 'tis plain he
        did his Devilish Endeavour, and stay'd till he was forc'd to
        abscond again.


We have many solid Tales well attested, as well in History as in the
Reports of honest People, who could not be deceived, intimating the
_Devil_'s personal Appearance, some in one Place, some in another; as
also sometimes in one Habit or Dress, and sometimes in another; and it
is to be observed, that in none of those which are most like to be real,
and in which there is least of Fancy and Vapour, you have any Mention of
the _Cloven Foot_, which rather seems to be a mere Invention of Men (and
perhaps chiefly of those who had a Cloven Understanding) I mean a
shallow kind of Craft, the Effect of an empty and simple Head, thinking
by such a well-meant, tho' weak Fraud, to represent the _Devil_ to the
old Women and Children of the Age, with some Addition suitable to the
Weakness of their Intellects, and suited to making them afraid of him.

I have another Account of a Person who travell'd upwards of four Years
with the _Devil_ in his Company, and convers'd most intimately with him
all the while; nay, if I may believe the Story, he knew most part of the
Time that he was the _Devil_, and yet convers'd with him, and that very
profitably, for he perform'd many very useful Services for him, and
constantly preserv'd him from the Danger of Wolves and wild Beasts,
which the Country he travell'd thro' was intolerably full of. Where, by
the way, you are to understand, that the Wolves and Bears in those
Countries knew the _Devil_, whatever Disguise he went in; or that the
_Devil_ has some Way to fright Bears and such Creatures, more than we
know of. Nor could this _Devil_ ever be prevail'd upon to hurt him or
any of his Company. This Account has an innumerable Number of diverting
Incidents attending it; but they are equal to all the rest in Bulk, and
therefore too long for this Book.

I find too upon some more ordinary Occasions the _Devil_ has appear'd to
several People at their Call: This indeed shews abundance of good Humour
in him, considering him as a _Devil_, and that he was mighty
complaisant: Nay some, they tell us, have a Power to raise the _Devil_
whenever they think fit; this I cannot bring the _Devil_ to a Level
with, unless I should allow him to be _Servus Servorum_, as another
_Devil_ in Disguise calls himself; subjected to ever old Wizard's Call;
or that he is under a Necessity of appearing on such or such particular
Occasions, whoever it is that calls him; which would bring the _Devil_'s
Circumstances to a pitch of Slavery which I see no Reason to believe of
them.

Here also I must take Notice again, that tho' I say the _Devil_, when I
speak of all these Apparitions, whether of a greater or lesser Kind, yet
I am not oblig'd to suppose Satan himself in Person is concern'd to shew
himself, but that some of his _Agents_, Deputies and Servants, are sent
to that Purpose, and directed what Disguise of Flesh and Blood to put
on, as may be suitable to the Occasion.

This seems to be the only Way to reconcile all those simple and
ridiculous Appearances which not _Satan_, but his Emissaries, (which we
old Women call Imps) sometimes make, and the mean and sorry Employment
they are put to: Thus Fame tells us of a certain Witch of Quality, who
call'd the _Devil_ once to carry her over a Brook where the Water was
swell'd with a hasty Rain, and lash'd him soundly with her Whip for
letting her Ladyship fall into the Water before she was quite over. Thus
also, as Fame tells us, she set the _Devil_ to work, and made him build
_Crowland_ Abbey, where there was no Foundation to be found, only for
disturbing the Workmen a little who were first set about it. So it
seems another laborious _Devil_ was oblig'd to dig the great Ditch cross
the Country from the Fenn Country to the Edge of _Suffolk_ and _Essex_;
which who ever he has preserv'd the Reputation of, and where it crosses
_New-Market_ Heath, 'tis call'd _Devil_'s _Ditch_ to this Day.

Another Piece of Punishment no doubt it was, when the _Devil_ was
oblig'd to bring the Stones out of _Wales_ into _Wiltshire_, to build
_Stone-heng_: How this was ordered in those Days, when it seems they
kept _Satan_ to hard Labour, I know not; I believe it must be registred
among the antient Pieces of Art which are lost in the World, such as
melting of Stone, painting of Glass, _&c._ Certainly they had the
_Devil_ under Correction in those Days; that is to say, those lesser
Sorts of _Devils_; but I cannot think that the _muckle Thief Devil_, as
they call him in the _North_, the Grand Seignior _Devil_ of all, was
ever reduced to Discipline. What _Devil_ it was that _Dunstan_ took by
the Nose with his red hot Tongs, I have not yet examin'd Antiquity
enough to be certain of, any more than I can what Devil it was that St.
_Francis_ play'd so many warm Tricks with, and made him run away from
him so often: However, this I take upon me to say, in the _Devil_'s
Behalf, that it cou'd not be our _Satan_, the Arch _Devil_ of all
_Devils_, of whom I have been talking so long.

Now is it unworthy the Occasion, to take notice that we really wrong the
_Devil_, and speak of him very much to his Disadvantage, when we say of
such a Great Lord, or of such a Lady of Quality, _I think the_ Devil _is
in your Grace_: No, no, Satan has other Business, he very rarely
possesses F--ls: Besides, some are so far from having the _Devil_ in
them, that they are really transmigrated into the very Essence of the
_Devil_ themselves; and others again not transmigrated, or assimilated,
but Indeed and in Truth shew us that they are to have mere native
_Devils_ in every Part and Parcel of them, and that the rest is only
Masque and Disguise. Thus if _Rage_, _Envy_, _Pride_ and _Revenge_ can
constitute the Parts of a _Devil_, why should not a Lady of such
Quality, in whom all those Extraordinaries abound, have a Right to the
Title of being a _Devil_ really and substantially, and to all Intents
and Purposes, in the most perfect and absolute Sense, according to the
most exquisite Descriptions of Devils already given by me or any Body
else; and even just as _Joan_ of _Arc_, or _Joan_ Queen of _Naples_
were, who were both sent home to their native Country, as soon as it was
discovered that they were real _Devils_, and that _Satan_ acknowledg'd
them in that Quality.

Nor does my Lady D----ss's wearing sometimes a Case of Humanity about
her, call'd _Flesh and Blood_, at all alter the Case; for so 'tis
Evident, according to our present Hypothesis, _Satan_ has been always
allow'd to do, upon urgent Occasions; ay, and to make his Personal
Appearance as such, among even the Sons and Daughters of God too, as
well as among the Children of Men; and therefore _her Grace_ may have
appeared in the Shape of a fine Lady, as long as she has been suppos'd
to do, without any Impeachment of her just Claim to the Title of
_Devil_; which being her true and natural Original, she ought not, nor
indeed shall not, by me, be denied her Shapes of Honour, whenever she
pleases to declare for a Re-assumption.

And farther, to give every Truth its due Illustration, this need not be
thought so strange; and is far from being unjust; _her Grace_ (as she,
it may be, is now stiled) has not acted, at least that I never heard of,
so unworthy her great and illustrious Original, that we should think she
has lost any thing by walking about the World so many Years in
Apparition: But to give her the due Homage of her Quality, she has acted
as consonant to the Essence and Nature of _Devil_, which she has such a
Claim to, as was consistent with the needful Reserve of her present
Disguise.

Nor shall we lead the Reader into any Mistake concerning this part of
our Work, as if this was or is meant to be a particular Satyr upon the
D-----ss of -----------, and upon her only, as if we had no DEVILS among
us in the Phenomena of fair Ladies, but this one: If Satan would be so
honest to us as he might be (and 'twou'd be very ingenuous in him, that
must be acknowledg'd, to give us a little of his Illumination in this
Case) we should soon be able to unmasque a great many notable Figures
among us, to our real Surprize.

Indeed 'tis a Point worth our further Enquiry, and would be a Discovery
many ways to our Advantage, were we bless'd with it, to see how many
real _Devils_ we have walking up and down the World in Masque, and how
many Hoop-Petticoats compleat the entire Masque that disguises the Devil
in the Shape of that Thing call'd Woman.

As for the Men, Nature has satisfied her self in letting them be their
own Disguise, and in suffering them to act the _old Women_, as old Women
are vulgarly understood, in Matters of Council and Politicks; but if at
any time they have Occasion for the _Devil_ in Person, they are oblig'd
to call him to their Aid in such Shape as he pleases to make use of _pro
hac vice_; and of all those Shapes, the most agreeable to him seems to
be that of a Female of Quality, in which he has infinite Opportunity to
act to Perfection, what Part soever he is call'd in for.

How happy are those People who they say have the particular Quality, or
acquir'd Habit, call'd the _Second Sight_; one Sort of whom they tell us
are able to distinguish the _Devil_, in whatever Case or Outside of
Flesh and Blood he is pleas'd to put on, and consequently could know the
_Devil_ wherever they met him? Were I blest with this excellent and
useful Accomplishment, how pleasant would it be, and how would it
particularly gratify my Spleen, and all that which I, in common with my
fellow Creatures carry about me, call'd Ill-Nature, to stand in the
_Mall_, or at the Entrance to any of our _Assemblies of Beauties_, and
point them out as they pass by, with this particular Mark, That's a
_Devil_; that fine young Toast is a _Devil_; There's a _Devil_ drest in
a new Habit for the Ball; There's a _Devil_ in a Coach and Six, _cum
aliis_. In short, it would make a merry World among us if we cou'd but
enter upon some proper Method of such Discriminations: but, _Lawr'd_,
what a Hurricane would it raise, if, like -------, who they say scourg'd
the _Devil_ so often that he durst not come near him in any Shape
whatever, we cou'd find some new Method out to make the _Devil_ unmask,
like the Angel _Uriel_, who, Mr. _Milton_ says, had an enchanted Spear,
with which if he did but touch the _Devil_, in whatever Disguise he had
put on, it oblig'd him immediately to start up, and shew himself in his
true original Shape, mere _Devil_ as he was.

This would do nicely, and as I who am originally a Projector, have spent
some Time upon this Study, and doubt not in a little Time to finish my
Engine, which I am contriving, to screw the _Devil_ out of every Body,
or any Body; I question not when I have brought it to Perfection, but I
shall make most excellent Discoveries by it; and besides the many
extraordinary Advantages of it to human Society, I doubt not but it will
make good Sport in the World too; wherefore, when I publish my
Proposals, and divide it into Shares, as other less useful Projects have
been done, I question not, for all the severe Act lately pass'd against
Bubbles, but I shall get Subscribers enough, _&c._

In a Word, a secret Power of discovering what Devils we have among us,
and where and what Business they are doing, would be a vast Advantage to
us all; that we might know among the Crowd of _Devils_ that walk about
Streets, who are _Apparitions_, and who are not.

Now I, you must know, at certain Intervals when the Old Gentleman's
Illuminations are upon me, and when I have something of an
_Eclaricissement_ with him, have some Degrees of this discriminating
_Second Sight_, and therefore 'tis no strange thing for me to tell a
great many of my Acquaintance that they are really _Devils_, when they
themselves know nothing of the Matter: Sometimes indeed I find it pretty
hard to convince them of it, or at least they are very unwilling to own
it, but it is not the less so for that.

I had a long Discourse upon this Subject one day, with a young beautiful
Lady of my Acquaintance, who the World very much admired; and as the
World judges no farther than they can see, (and how should they, you
would say) they took her to be, as she really was, a most charming
Creature.

To me indeed she discover'd her self many Ways, besides the Advantage I
had of my extraordinary Penetration by the magic Powers which I am
vested with: To me, _I say_, she appear'd a Fury, a Satyr, a fiery
little Fiend as could possibly be dress'd up in Flesh; in short, she
appear'd to me what really she was, a very DEVIL: It is natural to human
Creatures to desire to discover any extraordinary Powers they are
possess'd of superior to others, and this Itch prevailing in me, among
the rest, I was impatient to let this Lady know that I understood her
Composition perfectly well, nay, as well as she did her self.

In order to this, happening to be in the Family once for some Days, and
having the Honour to be very intimate with her and her Husband too, I
took an Opportunity on an extraordinary Occasion, when she was in the
Height of good Humour, to talk with her; You must note, that as I said,
the Lady was in an extraordinary good Humour, and there had been a great
deal of Mirth in the Family for some Days; but one Evening, Sir _E----_
her Husband, upon some very sharp Turn she gave to another Gentleman,
which made all the Company pleasant, run to her, and with a Passion of
good Humour takes her in his Arms, and turning to me, says he, Jack,
This Wife of mine is full of Wit and good Humour, but when she has a
Mind to be smart, she is the keenest little _Devil_ in the World: This
was alluding to the quick Turn she had given the other Gentleman.

Is that the best Language you can give your Wife, says my Lady? O Madam,
says I, such _Devils_ as you, are all _Angels_; ay, ay, says my Lady, I
know that, he has only let a Truth fly out that he does not understand:
Look ye there now, _says Sir_ Edward, could any thing but such a dear
_Devil_ as this have said a thing so pointed? Well, well, adds he,
_Devil_ to a Lady in a Man's Arms, is a Word of divers Interpretations.
Thus they rallied for a good while, he holding her fast all the while in
his Arms, and frequently kissing her, and at last it went off, all in
Sunshine and Mirth.

But the next Day, for I had the Honour to lodge in the Lady's Father's
House, where it all happen'd; I say, the next Day my Lady begins with me
upon the Subject, and that very smartly, so that first I did not know
whether she was in jest or earnest: Ay, ay, _says she_, you Men make
nothing of your Wives after you have them, _alluding to the Discourse
with_ Sir Edward _the Night before_.

Why Madam, says I, _we Men_, as you are pleas'd to term it, if we meet
with good Wives worship them, and make Idols of them, what would you
have more of us?

No, no, says she, before you have them they are Angels, but when you
have been in Heaven, _adds she and smil'd_, then they are Devils.

Why Madam, _says I_, Devils are Angels, you know, and were the highest
Sort of Angels once.

Yes, _says she_, very smartly, all _Devils_ are Angels, but all Angels
are not _Devils_.

But Madam, _says I_, you should never take it ill to be call'd _Devil_,
you know.

I know, _says she_, hastily, what d'ye mean by that?

Why Madam, _says I_, and look'd very gravely and serious, I thought you
had known that I knew it, or else I would not have said so, for I would
not offend you; but you may depend I shall never discover it, unless you
order me to do so for your particular Service.

Upon this she look'd hard and wild, and bid me explain my self.

I told her, I was ready to explain my self, if she would give me her
Word, she would not resent it, and would take nothing ill.

She gave me her word solemnly she would not, tho' like a true _Devil_
she broke her Promise with me all at once.

Well however, being unconcern'd whether she kept her Word or no, I
began, by telling her that I had not long since obtain'd the second
sight, and had some years studied Magic, by which I could penetrate into
many things, which to ordinary Perception were invisible, and had some
Glasses, by the Help of which I could see into all visionary or
imaginary Appearances in a different Manner than other People did.

Very well, _says she_, suppose you can, what's that to me?

I told her it was nothing to her any further than that as she knew her
self to be originally not the same Creature she seem'd to be, but was of
a sublime angelic Original; so by the Help of my recited Art I knew it
too, and so far it might relate to her.

Very fine, says she, so you would make a _Devil_ of me indeed.

I took that Occasion to tell her, I would make nothing of her but what
she was; that I suppos'd she knew well enough God Almighty never thought
fit to make any human Creature so perfect and compleatly beautiful as
she was, but that such were also reserved for Figures to be assum'd by
Angels of one Kind or other.

She rallied me upon that, and told me that would not bring me off, for I
had not determined her for any thing Angelic, but a meer _Devil_; and
how could I flatter her with being handsome and a _Devil_ both at the
same time?

I told her, as Satan, whom we abusively call'd _Devil_, was an immortal
Seraph, and of an original angelic Nature, so abstracted from any thing
wicked, he was a most glorious Being; that when he thought fit to encase
himself with Flesh, and walk about in Disguise, it was in his Power
equally with the other Angels to make the Form he took upon himself be
as he thought fit, beautiful or deform'd.

Here she disputed the Possibility of that, and after charging me faintly
with flattering her Face, told me the Devil could not be represented by
any thing handsome, alledging our constant picturing the _Devil_ in all
the frightful Appearances imaginable.

I told her we wrong'd him very much in that, and quoted St. _Francis_,
to whom the _Devil_ frequently appeared in the Form of the most
incomparably beautiful naked Woman, to allure him, and what Means he
used to turn the Appearance into a _Devil_ again, and how he effected
it.

She put by the Discourse, and returned to that of Angels, and insisted
that Angels did not always assume beautiful Appearances; that sometimes
they appear'd in terrible Shapes, but that when they did not, it was at
best only amiable Faces, not exquisite; and that therefore it would not
hold, that to be handsome, should always render them suspected.

I told her the _Devil_ had more Occasion to form Beauties than other
Angels had, his Business being principally to deceive and ensnare
Mankind. And then I gave her some Examples upon the whole.

I found by her Discourse she was willing enough to pass for an _Angel_,
but 'twas the hardest thing in the World to convince her that she was a
DEVIL, and she would not come into that by any means; she argued that I
knew her Father, and that her Mother was a very good Woman, and was
delivered of her in the ordinary Way, and that there was such and such
Ladies who were present in the Room when she was born, and that had
often told her so.

I told her that was nothing in such a Case as hers; that when the Old
Gentleman had occasion to transform himself into a fine Lady, he could
easily dispose of a Child, and place himself in the Cradle instead of
it, when the Nurse or Mother were asleep; nay, or when they were broad
awake either, it was the same thing to him; and I quoted _Luther_ to her
upon that Occasion, who affirms that it had been so. However I said, to
convince her that I knew it, (for I would have it that she knew it
already) if she pleas'd I would go to my Chamber and fetch her my Magick
Looking-glass, where she should see her own Picture, not only as it was
an angelick Picture for the World to admire, but a _Devil_ also
frightful enough to any Body but herself and me that understood it.

No, no, _said she_, I'll look in none of your conjuring Glasses; I know
my self well enough, and I desire to look no otherwise than I am.

No, Madam, _says I_, I know that very well; nor do you need any better
Shape than that you appear in, 'tis most exquisitely fine; all the World
knows you are a compleat Beauty, and that is a clear Evidence what you
would be if your present appearing Form was reduced to its proper
Personality.

_Appearing Form!_ says she, why, what would you make an _Apparition_ of
me?

An _Apparition!_ Madam, said I, yes, to be sure; why you know, you are
nothing else but an _Apparition_; and what else would you be, when it is
so infinitely to your Advantage?

With that, she turn'd pale and angry, and then rose up hastily, and
look'd into the Glass, (_a large Peer-glass being in the Room_) where
she stood, surveying her self from Head to Foot, with Vanity not a
little.

     I took that Time to slip away, and running up into my Apartment, I
        fetch'd my _Magic Glass_ as I call'd it, in which I had a hollow
        Case so framed behind a Looking-glass, that in the first; she would
        see her own Face only; in the second, she would see the _Devil_'s
        Face, ugly and frightful enough, but dress'd up with a Lady's
        Head-Clothes in a Circle, the _Devil_'s Face in the Center, and as
        it were at a little Distance behind.


I came down again so soon that she did not think the Time long,
especially having spent it in surveying her fair self; when I return'd,
I said, Come, Madam, do not trouble your self to look there, that is not
a Glass capable of shewing you any thing; come, take this Glass.

It will shew me as much of my self, _says she, a little scornfully_, as
I desire to see; so she continued looking in the Peer-glass; after some
time more (for seeing her a little out of Humour, I waited to see what
Observations she would make) I ask'd her if she had view'd her self to
her Satisfaction? She said she had, and she had seen nothing of _Devil_
about her. Come, Madam, said I, look here; and with that I open'd the
Looking-glass, and she look'd in it, but saw nothing but her own Face;
Well, _says she_, the Glasses agree well enough, I see no Difference;
what can you make of it? With that I took it a little away; Don't you?
_says I_, then I shou'd be mistaken very much; so I look'd in it my
self, and giving it a Turn imperceptible to her, I shew'd it her again,
where she saw the _Devil_ indeed, dress'd up like a fine Lady, but
ugly, and _Devil_ like as could be desired for a _Devil_ to be.

She started, and cry'd out most horribly, and told me, she thought I was
more of a _Devil_ than she, for that she knew nothing of all those
Tricks, and I did it to fright her, she believ'd I had rais'd the
_Devil_.

I told her it was nothing but her own natural Picture, and that she knew
well enough, and that I did not shew it her to inform her of it, but to
let her know that I knew it too; that so she might make no Pretences of
being offended when I talk'd familiarly to her of a Thing of this
Nature.

Very well; so, _says she_, I am a real frightful _Devil_, am I?

O, Madam, says I, don't say, _Am I?_ why you know what you are, don't
you? A _Devil_! ay, certainly; as sure as the rest of the World believes
you a Lady.

I had a great deal of farther Discourse with her upon that Subject, tho'
she would fain have beat me off of it, and two or three times she put
the Talk off, and brought something else on; but I always found Means to
revive it, and to attack her upon the Reality of her being a Devil, till
at last I made her downright angry, and then she shew'd it.

First she cried, told me I came to affront her, that I would not talk so
if Sir _Ed----_ was by; and that she ought not to be used so. I
endeavour'd to pacify her, and told her I had not treated her with any
Indecency, nor I would not; because while she thought fit to walk Abroad
_incog._ it was none of my Business to discover her; that if she thought
fit to tell Sir _Ed----_ any thing of the Discourse, she was very
welcome, or to conceal it, (_which I thought the wisest Course_) she
should do just as she pleas'd; but I made no question I should convince
Sir _E----_ her Husband, that what I said was just, and that I was
really so; whether it was for her Service or no for him to know it, was
for her to consider.

This calm'd her a little, and she look'd hard at me a Minute without
speaking a Word, when on a sudden she broke out thus: And you will
undertake, _says she_, to convince Sir _Ed----_ that he has married a
_Devil_, will ye? A fine Story indeed! and what follows? why then it
must follow that the Child I go with (for she was big with Child) will
be a _Devil_ too, will it? A fine Story for Sir _Ed----_ indeed! isn't
it?

I don't know that, Madam, said I, that's as you order it; by the
Father's Side, _said I_, I know it will not, but what it may by the
Mother's Side, that's a Doubt I can't resolve till the _Devil_ and I
talk farther about it.

You and the Devil talk together! _says she_, and looks rufully at me;
why do you talk with the _Devil_ then?

Ay, Madam, _says I_, as sure as ever you did your self; besides, said I,
can you question that? Pray who am I talking to now?

I think you are mad, _says she_; why you will make _Devils_ of all the
Family, it may be, and particularly I must be with Child of a _Devil_,
that's certain.

No, Madam, _said I_, 'tis not certain, as I said before, I question it.

Why you say I am the DEVIL, the Child, you know, has always most of the
Mother in it, then that must be a Devil too I think, what else can it
be, _says she_?

I can't tell that, Madam, _said I_; that's as you agree among your
selves, this Kind does not go by Generation; that's a Dispute foreign to
the present Purpose.

Then I entred into a Discourse with her of the Ends and Purposes for
which the Devil takes up such beautiful Forms as hers, and why it always
gave me a Suspicion when I saw a Lady handsomer than ordinary, and set
me upon the Search to be satisfied whether she was really a Woman or an
_Apparition_? a Lady or a Devil? allowing all along that her being a
Devil was quite out of the Question.

Upon that very Foot, she took me up again roundly, and so, _says she_,
you are very civil to me through all your Discourse, for I see it ends
all in that, and you take it as a thing confest, that I am a Devil! A
very pretty piece of good Usage indeed! _says she_; _I thank you for
it_.

Nay, Madam, _says I_, do not take it ill of me, for I only discover to
you that I knew it; I do not tell it you as a Secret, for you are
satisfied of that another way.

Satisfied of what? says she, that I am a Devil? I think the Devil's in
you: _And so began to be hot_.

A Devil! yes, Madam, says I, without doubt a meer DEVIL; take it as you
please, I can't help that: And so I began to take it ill that she should
be disgusted at opening such a well-known Truth to her.

With that she discover'd it all at once, for she turn'd _Fury_, in the
very Letter of it; flew out in a Passion, rail'd at me, curst me most
heartily, and immediately disappeared; which you know is the particular
Mark of a Spirit or Apparition.

We had a great deal of Discourse besides this, relating to several other
young Ladies of her Acquaintance, some of which, I said, were mere
_Apparitions_ like her self; and told her which were so, and which not;
and the Reason why they were so, and for what Uses and Purposes, some
to delude the World one way, and some another; and she was pretty well
pleased to hear that, but she could not bear to hear her own true
Character, which however, as cunning as she was, made her act the Devil
at last, as you have heard; and then vanished out of my sight.

I have seen her in Miniature several Times since; but she proves her
self still to be the Devil of a Lady, for she bears Malice, and will
never forgive me, that I would not let her be an Angel; but like a very
Devil as she is, she endeavours to kill me at a Distance; and indeed the
Poison of her Eyes, (Basilisk-like) is very strong, and she has a
strange Influence upon me; but I that know her to be a Devil, strive
very hard with my self to drive the Memory of her out of my Thoughts.

I have had two or three Engagements since this, with other _Apparitions_
of the same Sex, and I find they are all alike, they are willing enough
to be thought Angels, but the Word Devil does not go down at all with
them: But 'tis all one, whenever we see an _Apparition_, it is so
natural to say we have seen the Devil, that there's no prevailing with
Mankind to talk any other Language. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, the
other Day, that had courted a Lady a long time, had the Misfortune to
come a little suddenly upon her, when she did not expect him, and found
her in such a Rage at some of her Servants, that it quite disorder'd
her, especially a Footman; the Fellow had done something that was indeed
provoking, but not sufficient to put her into such a Passion, and so out
of her self; nor was she able to restrain her self when she saw her
Lover come in, but damn'd the Fellow, and rag'd like a Fury at him.

My Friend did his best to compose her, and begg'd the Fellow's Pardon of
her, but it would not do; nay, the poor Fellow made all the Submissions
that could be expected, but 'twas the same thing: And so the Gentleman,
not caring to engage himself farther than became him, withdrew, and came
no more at her for three Days, in all which time she was hardly cool.

The next Day my Friend came to me, and talking of it in Confidence to
me, I am afraid, _says he_, I am going to marry a She _Devil_, and so
told me the Story; I took no Notice to him, but finding out his
Mistress, and taking proper Measures, with some of my particular Skill,
I soon found out that it was really so, that she was a mere
_Apparition_; and had it not been for that accidental Disorder of her
Passions, which discover'd her Inside, she might indeed have cheated any
Man, for she was a lovely Devil as ever was seen; she talk'd like an
Angel, sung like a Syren, did every thing, and said every thing that was
taking and charming: But what then? it was all Apparition, for she was a
mere _Devil_. It is true, my Friend marry'd her, and tho' she was a
_Devil_ without doubt, yet either she behav'd so well, or he was so
good, I never could hear him find Fault with her.

These are particular Instances; but alas! I could run you a Length
beyond all those Examples, and give you such a List of Devils among the
gay Things of the Town, that would fright you to think of; and you would
presently conclude, with me, that all the perfect Beauties are Devils,
mere Apparitions; but Time and Paper fails, so we must only leave the
Men the Caution, let them venture at their Peril. I return to the
Subject.

We have a great many charming _Apparitions_ of like kind go daily about
the World in compleat Masquerade, and, tho' we must not say so, they are
in themselves mere _Devils_, wicked dangerous murthering Devils, that
kill various Ways, some, Basilisk-like, with their Eyes; some
Syren-like, with their Tongues; all _Murtherers_, even from the
_Beginning_: It is true, 'tis pity these pretty _Apparitions_ should be
Devils, and be so mischievous as they are; but since it is so, I can do
no less than to advertise you of it, that you may shun the Devil in
whatever Shape you meet with him.

Again, there are some half Devils, they say, like the _Sagittarii_, half
Man, half Horse, or rather like the _Satyr_, who, _they say_, is half
Devil, half Man; or, like my Lord Bishop, who, _they say_, was
half-headed; whether they mean half-witted or no, I do not find Authors
agreed about it: But if they had voted him such, it had been as kind a
thing as any they cou'd say of him, because it would have clear'd him
from the Scandal of being a Devil, or half a Devil, for we don't find
the Devil makes any Alliance with F----ls.

Then as to merry Devils, there's my Master _G------_, he may indeed have
the Devil in him, but it must be said, to the Credit of Possession in
general, that Satan would have scorn'd to have entred into a Soul so
narrow that there was not room to hold him, or to take up with so
discording a Creature, so abject, so scoundrel, as never made a Figure
among Mankind greater than that of a Thief, a _Moroder_, moulded up into
Quality, and a Raparee dress'd up _a-la-Masque_, with a _Robe_ and a
_Coronet_.

Some little Dog-kennel Devil may indeed take up his Quarters in or near
him, and so run into and out of him as his Drum beats a Call; but to
him that was born a _Devil_, Satan, that never acts to no purpose, cou'd
not think him worth being possess'd by any thing better than a Devil of
a dirty Quality; that is to say, a Spirit too mean to wear the Name of
_Devil_, without some Badge or Addition of Infamy and Meanness to
distinguish it by.

Thus what _Devil_ of Quality would be confin'd to a _P--------n_, who
inheriting all the Pride and Insolence of his Ancestors, without one of
their good Qualities; the Bully, the _Billingsgate_, and all the
hereditary ill Language of his Family, without an Ounce of their
Courage; that has been rescued five or six times from the Scandal of a
Coward, by the Bravery, and at the Hazard of Friends, and never fail'd
to be ungrateful; that if ever he committed a Murther, did it in cold
Blood, because no body could prove he ever had any hot; who possess'd
with a Poltroon _Devil_, was always wickeder in the Dark, than he durst
be by Day-light; and who, after innumerable passive Sufferings, has been
turned out of human Society, because he could not be kick'd or cuff'd
either into good Manners or good Humour.

To say this was a _Devil_, an Apparition, or even a half _Devil_, would
be unkind to _Satan_ himself, since tho' he (the _Devil_) has so many
Millions of inferior _Devils_ under his Command, not one cou'd be found
base enough to match him, nor one _Devil_ found but what would think
himself dishonour'd to be employ'd about him.

Some merry good-for-nothing _Devils_ we have indeed, which we might, if
we had room, speak of at large, and divert you too with the Relation,
such as my Lady _Hatt's Devil_ in _Essex_, who upon laying a Joiner's
Mallet in the Window of a certain Chamber, would come very orderly and
knock with it all Night upon the Window, or against the Wainscot, and
disturb the Neighbourhood, and then go away in the Morning, as well
satisfied as may be; whereas if the Mallet was not left, he would think
himself affronted, and be as unsufferable and terrifying as possible,
breaking the Windows, splitting the Wainscot, committing all the
Disorders, and doing all the Damage that he was able to the House, and
to the Goods in it. And again, such as the Druming _Devil_ in the Well
at _Oundle_ in _Northamptonshire_, and such like.

A great many antick _Devils_ have been seen also, who seem'd to have
little or nothing to do, but only to assure us that they can appear if
they please, and that there is a Reality in the thing call'd Apparition.

As to Shadows of _Devils_, and imaginary Appearances, such as appear,
and yet are invisible at the same time, I had thought to have bestow'd a
Chapter upon them by themselves, but it may be as much to the Purpose to
let them alone, as to meddle with them; 'tis said our old Friend
_Luther_ used to be exceedingly troubled with such invisible
Apparitions, and he tells us much of them, in what they call his
Table-talk; but with Master _Luther_'s leave, tho' the _Devil_ passes
for a very great Lyar, I could swallow many things of his own proper
making, as soon as some of those I find in a Book that goes by his Name,
particularly the Story of the Devil in a Basket, the Child flying out of
the Cradle, and the like.

In a word, the walking _Devils_ that we have generally among us, are of
the female Sex; whether it be that the _Devil_ finds less Difficulty to
manage them, or that he lives quieter with them, or that they are fitter
for his Business than the Men, I shall not now enter into a Dispute
about that; perhaps he goes better disguis'd in the fair Sex than
otherwise; Antiquity gives us many Histories of She-Devils, such as we
can very seldom match for Wickedness among the Men; such now as in the
Text, _Lot_'s Daughters, _Joseph_'s Mistress, _Sampson_'s _Dalilah_,
_Herod_'s _Herodias_, these were certainly _Devils_, or play'd the
_Devil_ sufficiently in their Turn; one Male Apparition indeed the
Scripture furnishes you with, and that is _Judas_; for his Master says
expresly of him, _One of you is a Devil_; not has the _Devil_, or is
possess'd of the DEVIL; but really is a DEVIL, or is a real DEVIL.

How happy is it, that this great Secret comes thus to be discover'd to
mankind? Certainly the World has gone on in Ignorance a long time, and
at a strange rate, that we should have so many _Devils_ continually
walking about among us in humane Shape, and we know it not.

Philosophers tell us that there is a World of Spirits, and many learned
Pieces of Guess-work they make at it, representing the World to be so
near us, that the Air, as they describe it, must be full of Dragons and
_Devils_, enough to fright our Imaginations with the very Thoughts of
them; and if they say true, 'tis our great Felicity that we cannot see
any farther into it than we do, which if we could, would appear as
frightful as Hell itself; but none of those Sages ever told us, till
now, that half the People who converse with us are _Apparitions_,
especially of the Women; and among them especially this valuable Part,
the Woman of Figure, the fair, the beautiful, or patch'd and painted.

This unusual Phænomenon has been seen but a little while, and but a
little way, and the general Part of Mankind cannot come into the same
Notions about it; nay, perhaps they will all think it strange; but be
it as strange as it will, the Nature of the Thing confirms it, this
lower Sphere is full of _Devils_; and some of both Sexes have given
strange Testimonies of the Reality of their pre-existent _Devilism_ for
many Ages past, tho' I think it never came to that Height as it has now.

It is true, in former times Satan dealt much in old Women, and those, as
I have observ'd already, very ugly, _Ugly as a Witch_, _Black as a
Witch_, _I look like a Witch_, all proverbial Speeches, and which
testify'd what Tools it was Satan generally work'd with; and these old
Spectres, they tell us, us'd to ride thro' the Air in the Night, and
upon Broomsticks too, all mighty homely Doings; some say they us'd to go
to visit their Grand Seignior the _Devil_, in those Nocturnal
Perambulations: But be that as it will, 'tis certain the _Devil_ has
chang'd hands, and that now he walks about the World cloth'd in Beauty,
cover'd with the Charms of the Lovely, and he fails not to disguise
himself effectually by it, for who would think a beautiful Lady could be
a Masque to the Devil? and that a fine Face, a divine Shape, a heavenly
Aspect, should bring the _Devil_ in her Company, nay, should be herself
an _Apparition_, a mere DEVIL.

The Enquiry is indeed worth our while, and therefore I hope all the
enamour'd Beaus and Boys, all the Beauty-hunters and Fortune-hunters,
will take heed, for I suppose if they get the _Devil_, they will not
complain for want of a Fortune; and there's Danger enough, I assure you,
for the World is full of Apparitions, _non rosa sine spinis_; not a
Beauty without a _Devil_, the old Women Spectres, and the young Women
Apparitions; the ugly ones Witches, and the handsome ones _Devils_;
Lord ha' Mercy, and a [Illustration: Cross] may be Set on the Man's Door
that goes a courting.




CHAP. VIII.

_Of the Cloven-Foot walking about the World without the_ Devil, (viz.) _of
     Witches making Bargains for the_ Devil, _and particularly of selling
     the Soul to the_ Devil.


I have dwelt long upon the _Devil_ in Masque as he goes about the World
incog. and especially without his Cloven-Foot, and have touched upon
some of his Disguises in the Management of his Interest in the World; I
must say some of his Disguises only, for who can give a full account of
all his Tricks and Arts in so narrow a Compass as I am prescrib'd to?

But as I said, that every _Devil_ has not a Cloven-Foot, so I must add
now for the present Purpose, that every Cloven-Foot is not the Devil.

Not but that wherever I should meet the Cloven-Hoof, I should expect
that the _Devil_ was not far off, and should be apt to raise the Posse
against him, to apprehend him; yet it may happen otherwise, that's
certain; every Coin has its Counterfeit, every Art its Pretender, every
Whore her Admirer, every Error its Patron, and every Day has its DEVIL.

I have had some thought of making a full and compleat Discovery here of
that great Doubt which has so long puzzl'd the World, namely, whether
there is any such Thing, as secret making Bargains with the Devil, and
the first positive Assurance I can give you in the Case, is, that if
there is not, 'tis not his Fault, 'tis not for want of his Endeavour,
'tis plain, if you will pardon me for taking so mean a Step, as that of
quoting Scripture; I say, 'tis evident he would fain have made a
Contract with our Saviour, and he bid boldly (_give him his due_)
namely, _all the Kingdoms of the World for one bend of his Knee_:
Impudent Seraph! To think thy Lord should pay thee Homage! How many
would agree with him here for a less Price! They say, _Oliver Cromwell_
struck a Bargain with him, and that he gave _Oliver_ the Protectorship,
but would not let him call himself King, which stuck so close to that
_Furioso_, that the Mortification Spread into his Soul, and 'tis said,
he dy'd of a Gangreen in the Spleen. But take Notice and do _Oliver_
Justice; I do not vouch the Story, neither does the Bishop say one Word
of it.

Fame us'd to say, that the old famous Duke of _Luxemburg_ made a Magic
compact of this Kind; nay, I have heard many an (old Woman) Officer of
the Troops, who never car'd to see his Face, declare that he carry'd the
Devil at his Back. I remember a certain Author of a News Paper in
_London_ was once taken up, and they say, it cost him 50_l._ for
printing in his News, that _Luxemburg_ was _Humpback'd_. Now if I have
resolv'd the Difficulty, namely, that he was not hump'd, only carry'd
the _Devil_ at his Back; I think the poor Man should have his 50_l._
again, or I should have it for the Discovery.

I confess, I do not well understand this compacting with such a Fellow
as can neither write nor read; nor do I know who is the Scrivener
between them, or how the Indenture can be executed; but that which is
worse than all the rest is, that in _the first Place_, the _Devil_ never
keeps Articles; he will contract perhaps, and they say he is mighty
forward to make Conditions; but who shall bind him to the Performance,
and where is the Penalty if he fails? if we agree with him, he will be
apt enough to claim his Bargain and demand Payment; nay, perhaps before
it is due; but who shall make him stand to his.

Besides, he is a Knave in his Dealing, for he really promises what he
cannot perform; witness his impudent Proposal to our Lord mentioned
above. _All these Kingdoms will I give_ thee! _Lying Spirit!_ Why they
were none of thine to give, no not one of them; for the Earth is the
Lords and the kingdoms thereof, nor were they in his Power any more than
in his Right: So (I have heard that) some poor dismal Creatures have
sold themselves to the Devil for a Sum of Money, for so much Cash, and
yet even in that Case, when the Day of Payment came, I never heard that
he brought the Money or paid the Purchase, so that he is a Scoundrel in
his Treaties, for you shall trust for your Bargain, but not be able to
get your Money; and yet for your Part, he comes for you to an Hour: _Of
which by it self_.

In a Word, let me caution you all, when you trade with the Devil, either
get the Price or quit the Bargain; the _Devil_ is a cunning Shaver, he
will wriggle himself out of the Performance on his Side if possible, and
yet expect you should be punctual on your Side. They tell you of a poor
Fellow in _Herefordshire_, that offer'd to sell his Soul to him for a
Cow, and though the _Devil_ promised, and as they say, sign'd the
Writings, yet the poor Countryman could never get the Cow of him, but
still as he brought a Cow to him, some body or other came and challeng'd
it, proving that it was lost or stolen from them; so that the Man got
nothing but the Name of a Cow-stealer, and was at last carried to
_Hereford_ Goal, and condemn'd to be hang'd for stealing two Cows, one
after the other: The wicked Fellow was then in the greatest Distress
imaginable, he summon'd his _Devil_ to help him out, but he failed him,
as the _Devil_ always will; he really had not stolen the Cows, but they
were found in his Possession, and he could give no Account how he came
by them; at last he was driven to confess the Truth, told the horrid
Bargain he had made, and how the _Devil_ often promis'd him a Cow, but
never gave him one, except that several Times in the Morning early he
found a Cow put into his Yard, but it always prov'd to belong to some of
his Neighbours: Whethbbery, but would not undertake the
murder, as Wild (who feared that, by Marybone's demanding to
search the gentleman's coat, he might hazard suspicion himself)
insisted. Marybone was immediately entered by Wild in his black-
book, and was presently after impeached and executed as a fellow
on whom his leader could not place sufficient dependance; thus
falling, as many rogues do, a sacrifice, not to his roguery, but
to his conscience.




CHAPTER FOUR

IN WHICH A YOUNG HERO, OF WONDERFUL GOOD PROMISE, MAKES HIS FIRST
APPEARANCE, WITH MANY OTHER GREAT MATTERS.


Our hero next applied himself to another of his gang, who
instantly received his orders, and, instead of hesitating at a
single murder, asked if he should blow out the brains of all the
passengers, coachman and all. But Wild, whose moderation we have
before noted, would not permit him; and therefore, having given
him an exact description of the devoted person, with his other
necessary instructions, he dismissed him, with the strictest
orders to avoid, if possible, doing hurt to any other person.

The name of this youth, who will hereafter make some figure in
this history, being the Achates of our AEneas, or rather the
Hephaestion of our Alexander, was Fireblood. He had every
qualification to make second-rate GREAT MAN; or, in other words,
he was completely equipped for the tool of a real or first-rate
GREAT MAN. We shall therefore (which is the properest way of
dealing with this kind of GREATNESS) describe him negatively, and
content ourselves with telling our reader what qualities he had
not; in which number were humanity, modesty, and fear, not one
grain of any of which was mingled in his whole composition.

We will now leave this youth, who was esteemed the most promising
of the whole gang, and whom Wild often declared to be one of the
prettiest lads he had ever seen, of which opinion, indeed, were
most other people of his acquaintance; we will however leave him
at his entrance on this enterprize, and keep our attention fixed
on our hero, whom we shall observe taking large strides towards
the summit of human glory.

Wild, immediately at his return to town, went to pay a visit to
Miss Laetitia Snap; for he had that weakness of suffering himself
to be enslaved by women, so naturally incident to men of heroic
disposition; to say the truth, it might more properly be called a
slavery to his own appetite; for, could he have satisfied that, he
had not cared three farthings what had become of the little tyrant
for whom he professed so violent a regard. Here he was informed
that Mr. Heartfree had been conveyed to Newgate the day before,
the writ being then returnable. He was somewhat concerned at this
news; not from any compassion for the misfortunes of Heartfree,
whom he hated with such inveteracy that one would have imagined he
had suffered the same injuries from him which he had done towards
him. His concern therefore had another motive; in fact, he was
uneasy at the place of Mr. Heartfree's confinement, as it was to
be the scene of his future glory, and where consequently he should
be frequently obliged to see a face which hatred, and not shame,
made him detest the sight of.

To prevent this, therefore, several methods suggested themselves
to him. At first he thought of removing him out of the way by the
ordinary method of murder, which he doubted not but Fireblood
would be very ready to execute; for that youth had, at their last
interview, sworn, D--n his eyes, he thought there was no better
pastime than blowing a man's brains out. But, besides the danger
of this method, it did not look horrible nor barbarous enough for
the last mischief which he should do to Heartfree. Considering,
therefore, a little farther with himself, he at length came to a
resolution to hang him, if possible, the very next session.

Now, though the observation--how apt men are to hate those they
injure, or how unforgiving they are of the injuries they do
themselves, be common enough, yet I do not remember to have ever
seen the reason of this strange phaenomenon as at first it
appears. Know therefore, reader, that with much and severe
scrutiny we have discovered this hatred to be founded on the
passion of fear, and to arise from an apprehension that the person
whom we have ourselves greatly injured will use all possible
endeavours to revenge and retaliate the injuries we have done him.
An opinion so firmly established in bad and great minds (and those
who confer injuries on others have seldom very good or mean ones)
that no benevolence, nor even beneficence, on the injured side,
can eradicate it. On the contrary, they refer all these acts of
kindness to imposture and design of lulling their suspicion, till
an opportunity offers of striking a surer and severer blow; and
thus, while the good man who hath received it hath truly forgotten
the injury, the evil mind which did it hath it in lively and fresh
remembrance.

As we scorn to keep any discoveries secret from our readers, whose
instruction, as well as diversion, we have greatly considered in
this history, we have here digressed somewhat to communicate the
following short lesson to those who are simple and well inclined:
though as a Christian thou art obliged, and we advise thee, to
forgive thy enemy, NEVER TRUST THE MAN WHO HATH REASON TO SUSPECT
THAT YOU KNOW HE HATH INJURED YOU.




CHAPTER FIVE

MORE AND MORE GREATNESS, UNPARALLELED IN HISTORY OR ROMANCE.


In order to accomplish this great and noble scheme, which the vast
genius of Wild had contrived, the first necessary step was to
regain the confidence of Heartfree. But, however necessary this
was, it seemed to be attended with such insurmountable
difficulties, that even our hero for some time despaired of
success. He was greatly superior to all mankind in the steadiness
of his countenance, but this undertaking seemed to require more of
that noble quality than had ever been the portion of a mortal.
However, at last he resolved to attempt it, and from his success I
think we may fairly assert that what was said by the Latin poet of
labour, that it conquers all things, is much more true when
applied to impudence.

When he had formed his plan he went to Newgate, and burst
resolutely into the presence of Heartfree, whom he eagerly
embraced and kissed; and then, first arraigning his own rashness,
and afterwards lamenting his unfortunate want of success, he
acquainted him with the particulars of what had happened;
concealing only that single incident of his attack on the other's
wife, and his motive to the undertaking, which, he assured
Heartfree, was a desire to preserve his effects from a statute of
bankruptcy.

The frank openness of this declaration, with the composure of
countenance with which it was delivered; his seeming only ruffled
by the concern for his friend's misfortune; the probability of
truth attending it, joined to the boldness and disinterested
appearance of this visit, together with his many professions of
immediate service at a time when he could not have the least
visible motive from self-love; and above all, his offering him
money, the last and surest token of friendship, rushed with such
united force on the well-disposed heart, as it is vulgarly called,
of this simple man, that they instantly staggered and soon
subverted all the determination he had before made in prejudice of
Wild, who, perceiving the balance to be turning in his favour,
presently threw in a hundred imprecations on his own folly and
ill-advised forwardness to serve his friend, which had thus
unhappily produced his ruin; he added as many curses on the count,
whom he vowed to pursue with revenge all over Europe; lastly, he
cast in some grains of comfort, assuring Heartfree that his wife
was fallen into the gentlest hands, that she would be carried no
farther than Dunkirk, whence she might very easily be redeemed.

Heartfree, to whom the lightest presumption of his wife's fidelity
would have been more delicious than the absolute restoration of
all his jewels, and who, indeed, had with the utmost difficulty
been brought to entertain the slightest suspicion of her
inconstancy, immediately abandoned all distrust of both her and
his friend, whose sincerity (luckily for Wild's purpose) seemed to
him to depend on the same evidence. He then embraced our hero, who
had in his countenance all the symptoms of the deepest concern,
and begged him to be comforted; saying that the intentions, rather
than the actions of men, conferred obligations; that as to the
event of human affairs, it was governed either by chance or some
superior agent; that friendship was concerned only in the
direction of our designs; and suppose these failed of success, or
produced an event never so contrary to their aim, the merit of a
good intention was not in the least lessened, but was rather
entitled to compassion.

Heartfree however was soon curious enough to inquire how Wild had
escaped the captivity which his wife then suffered. Here likewise
he recounted the whole truth, omitting only the motive to the
French captain's cruelty, for which he assigned a very different
reason, namely, his attempt to secure Heartfree's jewels. Wild
indeed always kept as much truth as was possible in everything;
and this he said was turning the cannon of the enemy upon
themselves.

Wild, having thus with admirable and truly laudable conduct
achieved the first step, began to discourse on the badness of the
world, and particularly to blame the severity of creditors, who
seldom or never attended to any unfortunate circumstances, but
without mercy inflicted confinement on the debtor, whose body the
law, with very unjustifiable rigour, delivered into their power.
He added, that for his part, he looked on this restraint to be as
heavy a punishment as any appointed by law for the greatest
offenders. That the loss of liberty was, in his opinion, equal to,
if not worse, than the loss of life; that he had always
determined, if by any accident or misfortune he had been subjected
to the former, he would run the greatest risque of the latter to
rescue himself from it; which he said, if men did not want
resolution, was always enough; for that it was ridiculous to
conceive that two or three men could confine two or three hundred,
unless the prisoners were either fools or cowards, especially when
they were neither chained nor fettered. He went on in this manner
till, perceiving the utmost attention in Heartfree, he ventured to
propose to him an endeavour to make his escape, which he said
might easily be executed; that he would himself raise a party in
the prison, and that, if a murder or two should happen in the
attempt, he (Heartfree) might keep free from any share either in
the guilt or in the danger.

There is one misfortune which attends all great men and their
schemes, viz.--that, in order to carry them into execution, they
are obliged, in proposing their purpose to their tools, to
discover themselves to be of that disposition in which certain
little writers have advised mankind to place no confidence; an
advice which hath been sometimes taken. Indeed, many
inconveniences arise to the said great men from these scribblers
publishing without restraint their hints or alarms to society; and
many great and glorious schemes have been thus frustrated;
wherefore it were to be wished that in all well-regulated
governments such liberties should be by some wholesome laws
restrained, and all writers inhibited from venting any other
instructions to the people than what should be first approved and
licensed by the said great men, or their proper instruments or
tools; by which means nothing would ever be published but what
made for the advancing their most noble projects.

Heartfree, whose suspicions were again raised by this advice,
viewing Wild with inconceivable disdain, spoke as follows: "There
is one thing the loss of which I should deplore infinitely beyond
that of liberty and of life also; I mean that of a good
conscience; a blessing which he who possesses can never be
thoroughly unhappy; for the bitterest potion of life is by this so
sweetened, that it soon becomes palatable; whereas, without it,
the most delicate enjoyments quickly lose all their relish, and
life itself grows insipid, or rather nauseous, to us. Would you
then lessen my misfortunes by robbing me of what hath been my only
comfort under them, and on which I place my dependence of being
relieved from them? I have read that Socrates refused to save his
life by breaking the laws of his country, and departing from his
prison when it was open. Perhaps my virtue would not go so far;
but heaven forbid liberty should have such charms to tempt me to
the perpetration of so horrid a crime as murder! As to the poor
evasion of committing it by other hands, it might be useful indeed
to those who seek only the escape from temporal punishment, but
can be of no service to excuse me to that Being whom I chiefly
fear offending; nay, it would greatly aggravate my guilt by so
impudent an endeavour to impose upon Him, and by so wickedly
involving others in my crime. Give me, therefore, no more advice
of this kind; for this is my great comfort in all my afflictions,
that it is in the power of no enemy to rob me of my conscience,
nor will I ever be so much my own enemy as to injure it."

Though our hero heard all this with proper contempt, he made no
direct answer, but endeavoured to evade his proposal as much as
possible, which he did with admirable dexterity: this method of
getting tolerably well off, when you are repulsed in your attack
on a man's conscience, may be stiled the art of retreating, in
which the politician, as well as the general, hath sometimes a
wonderful opportunity of displaying his great abilities in his
profession.

Wild, having made this admirable retreat, and argued away all
design of involving his friend in the guilt of murder, concluded,
however, that he thought him rather too scrupulous in not
attempting his escape and then, promising to use all such means as
the other would permit in his service, took his leave for the
present. Heartfree, having indulged himself an hour with his
children, repaired to rest, which he enjoyed quiet and
undisturbed; whilst Wild, disdaining repose, sat up all night,
consulting how he might bring about the final destruction of his
friend, without being beholden to any assistance from himself,
which he now despaired of procuring. With the result of these
consultations we shall acquaint our reader in good time, but at
present we have matters of much more consequence to relate to him.




CHAPTER SIX

THE EVENT OF FIREBLOOD'S ADVENTURE; AND A THREAT OF MARRIAGE,
WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED EITHER AT SMITHFIELD OR ST.
JAMES'S.


Fireblood returned from his enterprise unsuccessful. The gentleman
happened to go home another way than he had intended; so that the
whole design miscarried. Fireblood had indeed robbed the coach,
and had wantonly discharged a pistol into it, which lightly
wounded one of the passengers in the arm. The booty he met with
was not very considerable, though much greater than that with
which he acquainted Wild; for of eleven pounds in money, two
silver watches, and a wedding-ring, he produced no more than two
guineas and the ring, which he protested with numberless oaths was
his whole booty. However, when an advertisement of the robbery was
published, with a reward promised for the ring and the watches,
Fireblood was obliged to confess the whole, and to acquaint our
hero where he pawned the watches; which Wild, taking the full
value of them for his pains, restored to the right owner.

He did not fail catchising his young friend on this occasion. He
said he was sorry to see any of his gang guilty of a breach of
honour; that without honour PRIGGERY was at an end; that if a prig
had but honour he would overlook every vice in the world. "But,
nevertheless," said he, "I will forgive you this time, as you are
a hopeful lad, and I hope never afterwards to find you delinquent
in this great point."

Wild had now brought his gang to great regularity: he was obeyed
and feared by them all. He had likewise established an office,
where all men who were robbed, paying the value only (or a little
more) of their goods, might have them again. This was of notable
use to several persons who had lost pieces of plate they had
received from their grand-mothers; to others who had a particular
value for certain rings, watches, heads of canes, snuff-boxes,
&c., for which they would not have taken twenty times as much as
they were worth, either because they had them a little while or a
long time, or that somebody else had had them before, or from some
other such excellent reason, which often stamps a greater value on
a toy than the great Bubble-boy himself would have the impudence
to set upon it.

By these means he seemed in so promising a way of procuring a
fortune, and was regarded in so thriving a light by all the
gentlemen of his acquaintance, as by the keeper and turnkeys of
Newgate, by Mr. Snap, and others of his occupation, that Mr. Snap
one day, taking Mr. Wild the elder aside, very seriously proposed
what they had often lightly talked over, a strict union between
their families, by marrying his daughter Tishy to our hero. This
proposal was very readily accepted by the old gentleman, who
promised to acquaint his son with it.

On the morrow on which this message was delivered, our hero,
little dreaming of the happiness which, of its own accord, was
advancing so near towards him, had called Fireblood to him; and,
after informing that youth of the violence of his passion for the
young lady, and assuring him what confidence he reposed in him and
his honour, he despatched him to Miss Tishy with the following
letter; which we here insert, not only as we take it to be
extremely curious, but to be a much better pattern for that
epistolary kind of writing which is generally called love-letters
than any to be found in the academy of compliments, and which we
challenge all the beaus of our time to excel either in matter or
spelling.

"MOST DIVINE and ADWHORABLE CREETURE,--I doubt not but those IIs,
briter than the son, which have kindled such a flam in my hart,
have likewise the faculty of seeing it. It would be the hiest
preassumption to imagin you eggnorant of my loav. No, madam, I
sollemly purtest, that of all the butys in the unaversal glob,
there is none kapable of hateracting my IIs like you. Corts and
pallaces would be to me deserts without your kumpany, and with it
a wilderness would have more charms than haven itself. For I hop
you will beleve me when I sware every place in the univarse is a
haven with you. I am konvinced you must be sinsibel of my violent
passion for you, which, if I endevored to hid it, would be as
impossible as for you, or the son, to hid your buty's. I assure
you I have not slept a wink since I had the hapness of seeing you
last; therefore hop you will, out of Kumpassion, let me have the
honour of seeing you this afternune; for I am, with the greatest
adwhoration,

"Most deivine creeture, Iour most passionate amirer, Adwhorer, and
slave, JONATHAN WYLD."

If the spelling of this letter be not so strictly orthographical,
the reader will be pleased to remember that such a defect might be
worthy of censure in a low and scholastic character, but can be no
blemish in that sublime greatness of which we endeavour to raise a
complete idea in this history. In which kind of composition
spelling, or indeed any kind of human literature, hath never been
thought a necessary ingredient; for if these sort of great
personages can but complot and contrive their noble schemes, and
hack and hew mankind sufficiently, there will never be wanting fit
and able persons who can spell to record their praises. Again, if
it should be observed that the stile of this letter doth not
exactly correspond with that of our hero's speeches, which we have
here recorded, we answer, it is sufficient if in these the
historian adheres faithfully to the matter, though he embellishes
the diction with some flourishes of his own eloquence, without
which the excellent speeches recorded in antient historians
(particularly in Sallust) would have scarce been found in their
writings. Nay, even amongst the moderns, famous as they are for
elocution, it may be doubted whether those inimitable harangues
published in the monthly magazines came literally from the mouths
of the HURGOS, &c., as they are there inserted, or whether we may
not rather suppose one historian of great eloquence hath borrowed
the matter only, and adorned it with those rhetorical showers for
which many of the said HURGOS are not so extremely eminent.




CHAPTER SEVEN

MATTERS PRELIMINARY TO THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN MR. JONATHAN WILD AND
THE CHASTE LAETITIA.


But to proceed with our history; Fireblood, having received this
letter, and promised on his honour, with many voluntary
asseverations, to discharge his embassy faithfully, went to visit
the fair Laetitia. The lady, having opened the letter and read it,
put on an air of disdain, and told Mr. Fireblood she could not
conceive what Mr. Wild meant by troubling her with his
impertinence; she begged him to carry the letter back again,
saying, had she known from whom it came, she would have been d--d
before she had opened it. "But with you, young gentleman," says
she, "I am not in the least angry. I am rather sorry that so
pretty a young man should be employed in such an errand." She
accompanied these words with so tender an accent and so wanton a
leer, that Fireblood, who was no backward youth, began to take her
by the hand, and proceeded so warmly, that, to imitate his actions
with the rapidity of our narration, he in a few minutes ravished
this fair creature, or at least would have ravished her, if she
had not, by a timely compliance, prevented him.

Fireblood, after he had ravished as much as he could, returned to
Wild, and acquainted him as far as any wise man would, with what
had passed; concluding with many praises of the young lady's
beauty, with whom, he said, if his honour would have permitted
him, he should himself have fallen in love; but, d--n him if he
would not sooner be torn to pieces by wild horses than even think
of injuring his friend. He asserted indeed, and swore so heartily,
that, had not Wild been so thoroughly convinced of the impregnable
chastity of the lady, he might have suspected his success;
however, he was, by these means, entirely satisfied of his
friend's inclination towards his mistress.

Thus constituted were the love affairs of our hero, when his
father brought him Mr. Snap's proposal. The reader must know very
little of love, or indeed of anything else, if he requires any
information concerning the reception which this proposal met with.
Not guilty never sounded sweeter in the ears of a prisoner at the
bar, nor the sound of a reprieve to one at the gallows, than did
every word of the old gentleman in the ears of our hero. He gave
his father full power to treat in his name, and desired nothing
more than expedition.

The old people now met, and Snap, who had information from his
daughter of the violent passion of her lover, endeavoured to
improve it to the best advantage, and would have not only declined
giving her any fortune himself, but have attempted to cheat her of
what she owed to the liberality of her relations, particularly of
a pint silver caudle-cup, the gift of her grandmother. However, in
this the young lady herself afterwards took care to prevent him.
As to the old Mr. Wild, he did not sufficiently attend to all the
designs of Snap, as his faculties were busily employed in designs
of his own, to overreach (or, as others express it, to cheat) the
said Mr. Snap, by pretending to give his son a whole number for a
chair, when in reality he was intitled to a third only.

While matters were thus settling between the old folks the young
lady agreed to admit Mr. Wild's visits, and, by degrees, began to
entertain him with all the shew of affection which the great
natural reserve of her temper, and the greater artificial reserve
of her education, would permit. At length, everything being agreed
between their parents, settlements made, and the lady's fortune
(to wit, seventeen pounds and nine shillings in money and goods)
paid down, the day for their nuptials was fixed, and they were
celebrated accordingly.

Most private histories, as well as comedies, end at this period;
the historian and the poet both concluding they have done enough
for their hero when they have married him; or intimating rather
that the rest of his life must be a dull calm of happiness, very
delightful indeed to pass through, but somewhat insipid to relate;
and matrimony in general must, I believe, without any dispute, be
allowed to be this state of tranquil felicity, including so little
variety, that, like Salisbury Plain, it affords only one prospect,
a very pleasant one it must be confessed, but the same.

Now there was all the probability imaginable that this contract
would have proved of such happy note, both from the great
accomplishments of the young lady, who was thought to be possessed
of every qualification necessary to make the marriage state happy,
and from the truly ardent passion of Mr. Wild; but, whether it was
that nature and fortune had great designs for him to execute, and
would not suffer his vast abilities to be lost and sunk in the
arms of a wife, or whether neither nature nor fortune had any hand
in the matter, is a point I will mot determine. Certain it is that
this match did not produce that serene state we have mentioned
above, but resembled the most turbulent and ruffled, rather than
the most calm sea.

I cannot here omit a conjecture, ingenious enough, of a friend of
mine, who had a long intimacy in the Wild family. He hath often
told me he fancied one reason of the dissatisfactions which
afterwards fell out between Wild and his lady, arose from the
number of gallants to whom she had, before marriage, granted
favours; for, says he, and indeed very probable it is too, the
lady might expect from her husband what she had before received
from several, and, being angry not to find one man as good as ten,
she had, from that indignation, taken those steps which we cannot
perfectly justify.

From this person I received the following dialogue, which he
assured me he had overheard and taken down verbatim. It passed on
the day fortnight after they were married.




CHAPTER EIGHT

A DIALOGUE MATRIMONIAL, WHICH PASSED BETWEEN JONATHAN WILD, ESQ.,
AND LAETITIA HIS WIFE, ON THE MORNING OF THE DAY FORTNIGHT ON
WHICH HIS NUPTIALS WERE CELEBRATED; WHICH CONCLUDED MORE AMICABLY
THAN THOSE DEBATES GENERALLY DO.


Jonathan. My dear, I wish you would lie a little longer in bed
this morning.

Laetitia. Indeed I cannot; I am engaged to breakfast with Jack
Strongbow.

Jonathan. I don't know what Jack Strongbow doth so often at my
house. I assure you I am uneasy at it; for, though I have no
suspicion of your virtue, yet it may injure your reputation in the
opinion of my neighbours.

Laetitia. I don't trouble my head about my neighbours; and they
shall no more tell me what company I am to keep than my husband
shall.

Jonathan. A good wife would keep no company which made her husband
uneasy.

Laetitia. You might have found one of those good wives, sir, if
you had pleased; I had no objection to it.

Jonathan. I thought I had found one in you.

Laetitia. You did! I am very much obliged to you for thinking me
so poor-spirited a creature; but I hope to convince you to the
contrary. What, I suppose you took me for a raw senseless girl,
who knew nothing what other married women do!

Jonathan. No matter what I took you for: I have taken you for
better and worse.

Laetitia. And at your own desire too; for I am sure you never had
mine. I should not have broken my heart if Mr. Wild had thought
proper to bestow himself on any other more happy woman. Ha, ha!

Jonathan. I hope, madam, you don't imagine that was not in my
power, or that I married you out of any kind of necessity.

Laetitia. O no, sir; I am convinced there are silly women enough.
And far be it from me to accuse you of any necessity for a wife. I
believe you could have been very well contented with the state of
a bachelor; I have no reason to complain of your necessities; but
that, you know, a woman cannot tell beforehand.

Jonathan. I can't guess what you would insinuate, for I believe no
woman had ever less reason to complain of her husband's want of
fondness.

Laetitia. Then some, I am certain, have great reason to complain
of the price they give for them. But I know better things. (These
words were spoken with a very great air, and toss of the head.)

Jonathan. Well, my sweeting, I will make it impossible for you to
wish me more fond.

Laetitia. Pray, Mr. Wild, none of this nauseous behaviour, nor
those odious words. I wish you were fond! I assure you, I don't
know what you would pretend to insinuate of me. I have no wishes
which misbecome a virtuous woman. No, nor should not, if I had
married for love. And especially now, when nobody, I am sure, can
suspect me of any such thing.

Jonathan. If you did not marry for love why did you marry?

Laetitia. Because it was convenient, and my parents forced me.

Jonathan. I hope, madam, at least, you will not tell me to my face
you have made your convenience of me.

Laetitia. I have made nothing of you; nor do I desire the honour
of making anything of you.

Jonathan. Yes, you have made a husband of me.

Laetitia. No, you made yourself so; for I repeat once more it was
not my desire, but your own.

Jonathan. You should think yourself obliged to me for that desire.

Laetitia. La, sir! you was not so singular in it. I was not in
despair. I have had other offers, and better too.

Jonathan. I wish you had accepted them with all my heart.

Laetitia. I must tell you, Mr. Wild, this is a very brutish manner
in treating a woman to whom you have such obligations; but I know
how to despise it, and to despise you too for shewing it me.
Indeed I am well enough paid for the foolish preference I gave to
you. I flattered myself that I should at least have been used with
good manners. I thought I had married a gentleman; but I find you
every way contemptible and below my concern.

Jonathan. D--n you, madam, have I not more reason to complain when
you tell me you married for your convenience only?

Laetitia. Very fine truly. Is it behaviour worthy a man to swear
at a woman? Yet why should I mention what comes from a wretch whom
I despise.

Jonathan. Don't repeat that word so often. I despise you as
heartily as you can me. And, to tell you a truth, I married you
for my convenience likewise, to satisfy a passion which I have now
satisfied, and you may be d--d for anything I care.

Laetitia. The world shall know how barbarously I am treated by
such a villain.

Jonathan. I need take very little pains to acquaint the world what
a b--ch you are, your actions will demonstrate it.

Laetitia. Monster! I would advise you not to depend too much on my
sex, and provoke me too far; for I can do you a mischief, and
will, if you dare use me so, you villain!

Jonathan. Begin whenever you please, madam; but assure yourself,
the moment you lay aside the woman, I will treat you as such no
longer; and if the first blow is yours, I promise you the last
shall be mine.

Laetitia. Use me as you will; but d--n me if ever you shall use me
as a woman again; for may I be cursed if ever I enter into your
bed more.

Jonathan. May I be cursed if that abstinence be not the greatest
obligation you can lay upon me; for I assure you faithfully your
person was all I had ever any regard for; and that I now loathe
and detest as much as ever I liked it.

Laetitia. It is impossible for two people to agree better; for I
always detested your person; and as for any other regard, you must
be convinced I never could have any for you.

Jonathan. Why, then, since we are come to a right understanding,
as we are to live together, suppose we agreed, instead of
quarrelling and abusing, to be civil to each other.

Laetitia. With all my heart.

Jonathan. Let us shake hands then, and henceforwards never live
like man and wife; that is, never be loving nor ever quarrel.

Laetitia. Agreed. But pray, Mr. Wild, why b--ch? Why did you
suffer such a word to escape you?

Jonathan. It is not worth your remembrance.

Laetitia. You agree I shall converse with whomsoever I please?

Jonathan. Without controul. And I have the same liberty?

Laetitia. When I interfere may every curse you can wish attend me!

Jonathan. Let us now take a farewell kiss, and may I be hanged if
it is not the sweetest you ever gave me.

Laetitia. But why b--ch? Methinks I should be glad to know why b--ch?

At which words he sprang from the bed, d--ing her temper heartily.
She returned it again with equal abuse, which was continued on
both sides while he was dressing. However, they agreed to continue
steadfast in this new resolution; and the joy arising on that
occasion at length dismissed them pretty chearfully from each
other, though Laetitia could not help concluding with the words,
why b--ch?




CHAPTER NINE

OBSERVATIONS ON THE FOREGOING DIALOGUE, TOGETHER WITH A BASE
DESIGN ON OUR HERO, WHICH MUST BE DETESTED BY EVERY LOVER OF
GREATNESS.


Thus did this dialogue (which, though we have termed it
matrimonial, had indeed very little savour of the sweets of
matrimony in it) produce at last a resolution more wise than
strictly pious, and which, if they could have rigidly adhered to
it, might have prevented some unpleasant moments as well to our
hero as to his serene consort; but their hatred was so very great
and unaccountable that they never could bear to see the least
composure in one another's countenance without attempting to
ruffle it. This set them on so many contrivances to plague and vex
one another, that, as their proximity afforded them such frequent
opportunities of executing their malicious purposes, they seldom
passed one easy or quiet day together.

And this, reader, and no other, is the cause of those many
inquietudes which thou must have observed to disturb the repose of
some married couples who mistake implacable hatred for
indifference; for why should Corvinus, who lives in a round of
intrigue, and seldom doth, and never willingly would, dally with
his wife, endeavour to prevent her from the satisfaction of an
intrigue in her turn? Why doth Camilla refuse a more agreeable
invitation abroad, only to expose her husband at his own table at
home? In short, to mention no more instances, whence can all the
quarrels, and jealousies, and jars proceed in people who have no
love for each other, unless from that noble passion above
mentioned, that desire, according to my lady Betty Modish, of
CURING EACH OTHER OF A SMILE.

We thought proper to give our reader a short taste of the domestic
state of our hero, the rather to shew him that great men are
subject to the same frailties and inconveniences in ordinary life
with little men, and that heroes are really of the same species
with other human creatures, notwithstanding all the pains they
themselves or their flatterers take to assert the contrary; and
that they differ chiefly in the immensity of their greatness, or,
as the vulgar erroneously call it, villany. Now, therefore, that
we may not dwell too long on low scenes in a history of the
sublime kind, we shall return to actions of a higher note and more
suitable to our purpose.

When the boy Hymen had, with his lighted torch, driven the boy
Cupid out of doors, that is to say, in common phrase, when the
violence of Mr. Wild's passion (or rather appetite) for the chaste
Laetitia began to abate, he returned to visit his friend
Heartfree, who was now in the liberties of the Fleet, and appeared
to the commission of bankruptcy against him. Here he met with a
more cold reception than he himself had apprehended. Heartfree had
long entertained suspicions of Wild, but these suspicions had from
time to time been confounded with circumstances, and principally
smothered with that amazing confidence which was indeed the most
striking virtue in our hero. Heartfree was unwilling to condemn
his friend without certain evidence, and laid hold on every
probable semblance to acquit him; but the proposal made at his
last visit had so totally blackened his character in this poor
man's opinion, that it entirely fixed the wavering scale, and he
no longer doubted but that our hero was one of the greatest
villains in the world.

Circumstances of great improbability often escape men who devour a
story with greedy ears; the reader, therefore, cannot wonder that
Heartfree, whose passions were so variously concerned, first for
the fidelity, and secondly for the safety of his wife; and,
lastly, who was so distracted with doubt concerning the conduct of
his friend, should at this relation pass unobserved the incident
of his being committed to the boat by the captain of the
privateer, which he had at the time of his telling so lamely
accounted for; but now, when Heartfree came to reflect on the
whole, and with a high prepossession against Wild, the absurdity
of this fact glared in his eyes and struck him in the most
sensible manner. At length a thought of great horror suggested
itself to his imagination, and this was, whether the whole was not
a fiction, and Wild, who was, as he had learned from his own
mouth, equal to any undertaking how black soever, had not spirited
away, robbed, and murdered his wife.

Intolerable as this apprehension was, he not only turned it round
and examined it carefully in his own mind, but acquainted young
Friendly with it at their next interview. Friendly, who detested
Wild (from that envy probably with which these GREAT CHARACTERS
naturally inspire low fellows), encouraged these suspicions so
much, that Heartfree resolved to attach our hero and carry him
before a magistrate.

This resolution had been some time taken, and Friendly, with a
warrant and a constable, had with the utmost diligence searched
several days for our hero; but, whether it was that in compliance
with modern custom he had retired to spend the honey-moon with his
bride, the only moon indeed in which it is fashionable or
customary for the married parties to have any correspondence with
each other; or perhaps his habitation might for particular reasons
be usually kept a secret, like those of some few great men whom
unfortunately the law hath left out of that reasonable as well as
honourable provision which it hath made for the security of the
persons of other great men.

But Wild resolved to perform works of supererogation in the way of
honour, and, though no hero is obliged to answer the challenge of
my lord chief justice, or indeed of any other magistrate, but may
with unblemished reputation slide away from it, yet such was the
bravery, such the greatness, the magnanimity of Wild, that he
appeared in person to it.

Indeed envy may say one thing, which may lessen the glory of this
action, namely, that the said Mr. Wild knew nothing of the said
warrant or challenge; and as thou mayest be assured, reader, that
the malicious fury will omit nothing which can anyways sully so
great a character, so she hath endeavoured to account for this
second visit of our hero to his friend Heartfree from a very
different motive than that of asserting his own innocence.




CHAPTER TEN

MR. WILD WITH UNPRECEDENTED GENEROSITY VISITS HIS FRIEND
HEARTFREE, AND THE UNGRATEFUL RECEPTION HE MET WITH.


It hath been said then that Mr. Wild, not being able on the
strictest examination to find in a certain spot of human nature
called his own heart the least grain of that pitiful low quality
called honesty, had resolved, perhaps a little too generally, that
there was no such thing. He therefore imputed the resolution with
which Mr. Heartfree had so positively refused to concern himself
in murder, either to a fear of bloodying his hands or the
apprehension of a ghost, or lest he should make an additional
example in that excellent book called God's Revenge against
Murder; and doubted not but he would (at least in his present
necessity) agree without scruple to a simple robbery, especially
where any considerable booty should be proposed, and the safety of
the attack plausibly made appear; which if he could prevail on him
to undertake, he would immediately afterwards get him impeached,
convicted, and hanged. He no sooner therefore had discharged his
duties to Hymen, and heard that Heartfree had procured himself the
liberties of the Fleet, than he resolved to visit him, and to
propose a robbery with all the allurements of profit, ease, and
safety.

This proposal was no sooner made than it was answered by Heartfree
in the following manner:--

"I might have hoped the answer which I gave to your former advice
would have prevented me from the danger of receiving a second
affront of this kind. An affront I call it, and surely, if it be
so to call a man a villain, it can be no less to shew him you
suppose him one. Indeed, it may be wondered how any man can arrive
at the boldness, I may say impudence, of first making such an
overture to another; surely it is seldom done, unless to those who
have previously betrayed some symptoms of their own baseness. If I
have therefore shewn you any such, these insults are more
pardonable; but I assure you, if such appear, they discharge all
their malignance outwardly, and reflect not even a shadow within;
for to me baseness seems inconsistent with this rule, OF DOING NO
OTHER PERSON AN INJURY FROM ANY MOTIVE OR ON ANY CONSIDERATION
WHATEVER. This, sir, is the rule by which I am determined to walk,
nor can that man justify disbelieving me who will not own he walks
not by it himself. But, whether it be allowed to me or no, or
whether I feel the good effects of its being practised by others,
I am resolved to maintain it; for surely no man can reap a benefit
from my pursuing it equal to the comfort I myself enjoy: for what
a ravishing thought, how replete with extasy, must the
consideration be, that Almighty Goodness is by its own nature
engaged to reward me! How indifferent must such a persuasion make
a man to all the occurrences of this life! What trifles must he
represent to himself both the enjoyments and the afflictions of
this world! How easily must he acquiesce under missing the former,
and how patiently will he submit to the latter, who is convinced
that his failing of a transitory imperfect reward here is a most
certain argument of his obtaining one permanent and complete
hereafter! Dost thou think then, thou little, paltry, mean animal
(with such language did he treat our truly great man), that I will
forego such comfortable expectations for any pitiful reward which
thou canst suggest or promise to me; for that sordid lucre for
which all pains and labour are undertaken by the industrious, and
all barbarities and iniquities committed by the vile; for a
worthless acquisition, which such as thou art can possess, can
give, or can take away?" The former part of this speech occasioned
much yawning in our hero, but the latter roused his anger; and he
was collecting his rage to answer, when Friendly and the
constable, who had been summoned by Heartfree on Wild's first
appearance, entered the room, and seized the great man just as his
wrath was bursting from his lips.

The dialogue which now ensued is not worth relating: Wild was soon
acquainted with the reason of this rough treatment, and presently
conveyed before a magistrate.

Notwithstanding the doubts raised by Mr. Wild's lawyer on his
examination, he insisting that the proceeding was improper, for
that a writ de homine replegiando should issue, and on the return
of that a capias in withernam, the justice inclined to commitment,
so that Wild was driven to other methods for his defence. He
therefore acquainted the justice that there was a young man
likewise with him in the boat, and begged that he might be sent
for, which request was accordingly granted, and the faithful
Achates (Mr. Fireblood) was soon produced to bear testimony for
his friend, which he did with so much becoming zeal, and went
through his examination with such coherence (though he was forced
to collect his evidence from the hints given him by Wild in the
presence of the justice and the accusers), that, as here was
direct evidence against mere presumption, our hero was most
honourably acquitted, and poor Heartfree was charged by the
justice, the audience, and all others who afterwards heard the
story, with the blackest ingratitude, in attempting to take away
the life of a man to whom he had such eminent obligations.

Lest so vast an effort of friendship as this of Fireblood's should
too violently surprize the reader in this degenerate age, it may
be proper to inform him that, beside the ties of engagement in the
same employ, another nearer and stronger alliance subsisted
between our hero and this youth, which latter was just departed
from the arms of the lovely Laetitia when he received her
husband's message; an instance which may also serve to justify
those strict intercourses of love and acquaintance which so
commonly subsist in modern history between the husband and
gallant, displaying the vast force of friendship contracted by
this more honourable than legal alliance, which is thought to be
at present one of the strongest bonds of amity between great men,
and the most reputable as well as easy way to their favour.

Four months had now passed since Heartfree's first confinement,
and his affairs had begun to wear a more benign aspect; but they
were a good deal injured by this attempt on Wild (so dangerous is
any attack on a GREAT MAN), several of his neighbours, and
particularly one or two of his own trade, industriously
endeavouring, from their bitter animosity against such kind of
iniquity, to spread and exaggerate his ingratitude as much as
possible; not in the least scrupling, in the violent ardour of
their indignation, to add some small circumstances of their own
knowledge of the many obligations conferred on Heartfree by Wild.
To all these scandals he quietly submitted, comforting himself in
the consciousness of his own innocence, and confiding in time, the
sure friend of justice, to acquit him.




CHAPTER ELEVEN

A SCHEME SO DEEPLY LAID, THAT IT SHAMES ALL THE POLITICS OF THIS
OUR AGE; WITH DIGRESSION AND SUBDIGRESSION.


Wild having now, to the hatred he bore Heartfree on account of
those injuries he had done him, an additional spur from this
injury received (for so it appeared to him, who, no more than the
most ignorant, considered how truly he deserved it), applied his
utmost industry to accomplish the ruin of one whose very name
sounded odious in his ears; when luckily a scheme arose in his
imagination which not only promised to effect it securely, but
(which pleased him most) by means of the mischief he had already
done him; and which would at once load him with the imputation of
having committed what he himself had done to him, and would bring
on him the severest punishment for a fact of which he was not only
innocent, but had already so greatly suffered by. And this was no
other than to charge him with having conveyed away his wife, with
his most valuable effects, in order to defraud his creditors.

He no sooner started this thought than he immediately resolved on
putting it in execution. What remained to consider was only the
quomodo, and the person or tool to be employed; for the stage of
the world differs from that in Drury-lane principally in this--
that whereas, on the latter, the hero or chief figure is almost
continually before your eyes, whilst the under-actors are not seen
above once in an evening; now, on the former, the hero or great
man is always behind the curtain, and seldom or never appears or
doth anything in his own person. He doth indeed, in this GRAND
DRAMA, rather perform the part of the prompter, and doth instruct
the well-drest figures, who are strutting in public on the stage,
what to say and do. To say the truth, a puppet-show will
illustrate our meaning better, where it is the master of the show
(the great man) who dances and moves everything, whether it be the
king of Muscovy or whatever other potentate alias puppet which we
behold on the stage; but he himself keeps wisely out of sight:
for, should he once appear, the whole motion would be at an end.
Not that any one is ignorant of his being there, or supposes that
the puppets are not mere sticks of wood, and he himself the sole
mover; but as this (though every one knows it) doth not appear
visibly, i.e., to their eyes, no one is ashamed of consenting to
be imposed upon; of helping on the drama, by calling the several
sticks or puppets by the names which the master hath allotted to
them, and by assigning to each the character which the great man
is pleased they shall move in, or rather in which he himself is
pleased to move them.

It would be to suppose thee, gentle reader, one of very little
knowledge in this world, to imagine them hast never seen some of
these puppet-shows which are so frequently acted on the great
stage; but though thou shouldst have resided all thy days in those
remote parts of this island which great men seldom visit, yet, if
thou hast any penetration, thou must have had some occasions to
admire both the solemnity of countenance in the actor and the
gravity in the spectator, while some of those farces are carried
on which are acted almost daily in every village in the kingdom.
He must have a very despicable opinion of mankind indeed who can
conceive them to be imposed on as often as they appear to be so.
The truth is, they are in the same situation with the readers of
romances; who, though they know the whole to be one entire
fiction, nevertheless agree to be deceived; and, as these find
amusement, so do the others find ease and convenience in this
concurrence. But, this being a subdigression, I return to my
digression.

A GREAT MAN ought to do his business by others; to employ hands,
as we have before said, to his purposes, and keep himself as much
behind the curtain as possible; and though it must be acknowledged
that two very great men, whose names will be both recorded in
history, did in these latter times come forth themselves on the
stage, and did hack and hew and lay each other most cruelly open
to the diversion of the spectators, yet this must be mentioned
rather as an example of avoidance than imitation, and is to be
ascribed to the number of those instances which serve to evince
the truth of these maxims: Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit. Ira
furor brevis est, &c.




CHAPTER TWELVE

NEW INSTANCES OF FRIENDLY'S FOLLY, ETC.


To return to my history, which, having rested itself a little, is
now ready to proceed on its journey: Fireblood was the person
chosen by Wild for this service. He had, on a late occasion,
experienced the talents of this youth for a good round perjury. He
immediately, therefore, found him out, and proposed it to him;
when, receiving his instant assent, they consulted together, and
soon framed an evidence, which, being communicated to one of the
most bitter and severe creditors of Heartfree, by him laid before
a magistrate, and attested by the oath of Fireblood, the justice
granted his warrant: and Heartfree was accordingly apprehended and
brought before him.

When the officers came for this poor wretch they found him meanly
diverting himself with his little children, the younger of whom
sat on his knees, and the elder was playing at a little distance
from him with Friendly. One of the officers, who was a very good
sort of a man, but one very laudably severe in his office, after
acquainting Heartfree with his errand, bad him come along and be
d--d, and leave those little bastards, for so, he said, he
supposed they were, for a legacy to the parish. Heartfree was much
surprized at hearing there was a warrant for felony against him;
but he shewed less concern than Friendly did in his countenance.
The elder daughter, when she saw the officer lay hold on her
father, immediately quitted her play, and, running to him and
bursting into tears, cried out, "You shall not hurt poor papa."
One of the other ruffians offered to take the little one rudely
from his knees; but Heartfree started up, and, catching the fellow
by the collar, dashed his head so violently against the wall,
that, had he had any brains, he might possibly have lost them by
the blow.

The officer, like most of those heroic spirits who insult men in
adversity, had some prudence mixt with his zeal for justice.
Seeing, therefore, this rough treatment of his companion, he began
to pursue more gentle methods, and very civilly desired Mr.
Heartfree to go with him, seeing he was an officer, and obliged to
execute his warrant; that he was sorry for his misfortune, and
hoped he would be acquitted. The other answered, "He should
patiently submit to the laws of his country, and would attend him
whither he was ordered to conduct him;" then, taking leave of his
children with a tender kiss, he recommended them to the care of
Friendly, who promised to see them safe home, and then to attend
him at the justice's, whose name and abode he had learned of the
constable.

Friendly arrived at the magistrate's house just as that gentleman
had signed the mittimus against his friend; for the evidence of
Fireblood was so clear and strong, and the justice was so incensed
against Heartfree, and so convinced of his guilt, that he would
hardly hear him speak in his own defence, which the reader
perhaps, when he hears the evidence against him, will be less
inclined to censure: for this witness deposed, "That he had been,
by Heartfree himself, employed to carry the orders of embezzling
to Wild, in order to be delivered to his wife: that he had been
afterwards present with Wild and her at the inn when they took
coach for Harwich, where she shewed him the casket of jewels, and
desired him to tell her husband that she had fully executed his
command;" and this he swore to have been done after Heartfree had
notice of the commission, and, in order to bring it within that
time, Fireblood, as well as Wild, swore that Mrs. Heartfree lay
several days concealed at Wild's house before her departure for
Holland.

When Friendly found the justice obdurate, and that all he could
say had no effect, nor was it any way possible for Heartfree to
escape being committed to Newgate, he resolved to accompany him
thither; where, when they arrived, the turnkey would have confined
Heartfree (he having no money) amongst the common felons; but
Friendly would not permit it, and advanced every shilling he had
in his pocket, to procure a room in the press-yard for his friend,
which indeed, through the humanity of the keeper, he did at a
cheap rate.

They spent that day together, and in the evening the prisoner
dismissed his friend, desiring him, after many thanks for his
fidelity, to be comforted on his account. "I know not," says he,
"how far the malice of my enemy may prevail; but whatever my
sufferings are, I am convinced my innocence will somewhere be
rewarded. If, therefore, any fatal accident should happen to me
(for he who is in the hands of perjury may apprehend the worst),
my dear Friendly, be a father to my poor children;" at which words
the tears gushed from his eyes. The other begged him not to admit
any such apprehensions, for that he would employ his utmost
diligence in his service, and doubted not but to subvert any
villanous design laid for his destruction, and to make his
innocence appear to the world as white as it was in his own
opinion.

We cannot help mentioning a circumstance here, though we doubt it
will appear very unnatural and incredible to our reader; which is,
that, notwithstanding the former character and behaviour of
Heartfree, this story of his embezzling was so far from surprizing
his neighbours, that many of them declared they expected no better
from him. Some were assured he could pay forty shillings in the
pound if he would. Others had overheard hints formerly pass
between him and Mrs. Heartfree which had given them suspicions.
And what is most astonishing of all is, that many of those who had
before censured him for an extravagant heedless fool, now no less
confidently abused him for a cunning, tricking, avaricious knave.




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

SOMETHING CONCERNING FIREBLOOD WHICH WILL SURPRIZE; AND SOMEWHAT
TOUCHING ONE OF THE MISS SNAPS, WHICH WILL GREATLY CONCERN THE
READER.


However, notwithstanding all these censures abroad, and in
despight of all his misfortunes at home, Heartfree in Newgate
enjoyed a quiet, undisturbed repose; while our hero, nobly
disdaining rest, lay sleepless all night, partly from the
apprehensions of Mrs. Heartfree's return before he had executed
his scheme, and partly from a suspicion lest Fireblood should
betray him; of whose infidelity he had, nevertheless, no other
cause to maintain any fear, but from his knowing him to be an
accomplished rascal, as the vulgar term it, a complete GREAT MAN
in our language. And indeed, to confess the truth, these doubts
were not without some foundation; for the very same thought
unluckily entered the head of that noble youth, who considered
whether he might not possibly sell himself for some advantage to
the other side, as he had yet no promise from Wild; but this was,
by the sagacity of the latter, prevented in the morning with a
profusion of promises, which shewed him to be of the most generous
temper in the world, with which Fireblood was extremely well
satisfied, and made use of so many protestations of his
faithfulness that he convinced Wild of the justice of his
suspicions.

At this time an accident happened, which, though it did not
immediately affect our hero, we cannot avoid relating, as it
occasioned great confusion in his family, as well as in the family
of Snap. It is indeed a calamity highly to be lamented, when it
stains untainted blood, and happens to an honourable house--an
injury never to be repaired--a blot never to be wiped out--a sore
never to be healed. To detain my reader no longer, Miss Theodosia
Snap was now safely delivered of a male infant, the product of an
amour which that beautiful (O that I could say virtuous!) creature
had with the count.

Mr. Wild and his lady were at breakfast when Mr. Snap, with all
the agonies of despair both in his voice and countenance, brought
them this melancholy news. Our hero, who had (as we have said)
wonderful good-nature when his greatness or interest was not
concerned, instead of reviling his sister-in-law, asked with a
smile, "Who was the father?" But the chaste Laetitia, we repeat
the chaste, for well did she now deserve that epithet, received it
in another manner. She fell into the utmost fury at the relation,
reviled her sister in the bitterest terms, and vowed she would
never see nor speak to her more; then burst into tears and
lamented over her father that such dishonour should ever happen to
him and herself. At length she fell severely on her husband for
the light treatment which he gave this fatal accident. She told
him he was unworthy of the honour he enjoyed of marrying into a
chaste family. That she looked on it as an affront to her virtue.
That if he had married one of the naughty hussies of the town he
could have behaved to her in no other manner. She concluded with
desiring her father to make an example of the slut, and to turn
her out of doors; for that she would not otherwise enter his
house, being resolved never to set her foot within the same
threshold with the trollop, whom she detested so much the more
because (which was perhaps true) she was her own sister.

So violent, and indeed so outrageous, was this chaste lady's love
of virtue, that she could not forgive a single slip (indeed the
only one Theodosia had ever made) in her own sister, in a sister
who loved her, and to whom she owed a thousand obligations.

Perhaps the severity of Mr. Snap, who greatly felt the injury done
to the honour of his family, would have relented, had not the
parish-officers been extremely pressing on this occasion, and for
want of security, conveyed the unhappy young lady to a place, the
name of which, for the honour of the Snaps, to whom our hero was
so nearly allied, we bury in eternal oblivion; where she suffered
so much correction for her crime, that the good-natured reader of
the male kind may be inclined to compassionate her, at least to
imagine she was sufficiently punished for a fault which, with
submission to the chaste Laetitia and all other strictly virtuous
ladies, it should be either less criminal in a woman to commit, or
more so in a man to solicit her to it.

But to return to our hero, who was a living and strong instance
that human greatness and happiness are not always inseparable. He
was under a continual alarm of frights, and fears, and jealousies.
He thought every man he beheld wore a knife for his throat, and a
pair of scissars for his purse. As for his own gang particularly,
he was thoroughly convinced there was not a single man amongst
them who would not, for the value of five shillings, bring him to
the gallows. These apprehensions so constantly broke his rest, and
kept him so assiduously on his guard to frustrate and circumvent
any designs which might be formed against him, that his condition,
to any other than the glorious eye of ambition, might seem rather
deplorable than the object of envy or desire.




CHAPTER FOURTEEN

IN WHICH OUR HERO MAKES A SPEECH WELL WORTHY TO BE CELEBRATED; AND
THE BEHAVIOUR OF ONE OF THE GANG, PERHAPS MORE UNNATURAL THAN ANY
OTHER PART OF THIS HISTORY.


There was in the gang a man named Blueskin, one of those merchants
who trade in dead oxen, sheep, &c., in short, what the vulgar call
a butcher. This gentleman had two qualities of a great man, viz.,
undaunted courage, and an absolute contempt of those ridiculous
distinctions of meum and tuum, which would cause endless disputes
did not the law happily decide them by converting both into suum.
The common form of exchanging property by trade seemed to him too
tedious; he therefore resolved to quit the mercantile profession,
and, falling acquainted with some of Mr. Wild's people, he
provided himself with arms, and enlisted of the gang; in which he
behaved for some time with great decency and order, and submitted
to accept such share of the booty with the rest as our hero
allotted him.

But this subserviency agreed ill with his temper; for we should
have before remembered a third heroic quality, namely, ambition,
which was no inconsiderable part of his composition. One day,
therefore, having robbed a gentleman at Windsor of a gold watch,
which, on its being advertised in the newspapers, with a
considerable reward, was demanded of him by Wild, he peremptorily
refused to deliver it.

"How, Mr. Blueskin!" says Wild; "you will not deliver the watch?"
"No, Mr. Wild," answered he; "I have taken it, and will keep it;
or, if I dispose of it, I will dispose of it myself, and keep the
money for which I sell it." "Sure," replied Wild, "you have not
the assurance to pretend you have any property or right in this
watch?" "I am certain," returned Blueskin, "whether I have any
right in it or no, you can prove none." "I will undertake," cries
the other, "to shew I have an absolute right to it, and that by
the laws of our gang, of which I am providentially at the head."
"I know not who put you at the head of it," cries Blueskin; "but
those who did certainly did it for their own good, that you might
conduct them the better in their robberies, inform them of the
richest booties, prevent surprizes, pack juries, bribe evidence,
and so contribute to their benefit and safety; and not to convert
all their labour and hazard to your own benefit and advantage."
"You are greatly mistaken, sir," answered Wild; "you are talking
of a legal society, where the chief magistrate is always chosen
for the public good, which, as we see in all the legal societies
of the world, he constantly consults, daily contributing, by his
superior skill, to their prosperity, and not sacrificing their
good to his own wealth, or pleasure, or humour: but in an illegal
society or gang, as this of ours, it is otherwise; for who would
be at the head of a gang, unless for his own interest? And without
a head, you know, you cannot subsist. Nothing but a head, and
obedience to that head, can preserve a gang a moment from
destruction. It is absolutely better for you to content yourselves
with a moderate reward, and enjoy that in safety at the disposal
of your chief, than to engross the whole with the hazard to which
you will be liable without his protection. And surely there is
none in the whole gang who hath less reason to complain than you;
you have tasted of my favours: witness that piece of ribbon you
wear in your hat, with which I dubbed you captain. Therefore pray,
captain, deliver the watch." "D--n your cajoling," says Blueskin:
"do you think I value myself on this bit of ribbon, which I could
have bought myself for sixpence, and have worn without your leave?
Do you imagine I think myself a captain because you, whom I know
not empowered to make one, call me so? The name of captain is but
a shadow: the men and the salary are the substance; and I am not
to be bubbled with a shadow. I will be called captain no longer,
and he who flatters me by that name I shall think affronts me, and
I will knock him down, I assure you." "Did ever man talk so
unreasonably?" cries Wild. "Are you not respected as a captain by
the whole gang since my dubbing you so? But it is the shadow only,
it seems; and you will knock a man down for affronting you who
calls you captain! Might not a man as reasonably tell a minister
of state, Sir, you have given me the shadow only? The ribbon or
the bauble that you gave me implies that I have either signalised
myself, by some great action, for the benefit and glory of my
country, or at least that I am descended from those who have done
so. I know myself to be a scoundrel, and so have been those few
ancestors I can remember, or have ever heard of. Therefore, I am
resolved to knock the first man down who calls me sir or right
honourable. But all great and wise men think themselves
sufficiently repaid by what procures them honour and precedence in
the gang, without enquiring into substance; nay, if a title or a
feather be equal to this purpose, they are substance, and not mere
shadows. But I have not time to argue with you at present, so give
me the watch without any more deliberation." "I am no more a
friend to deliberation than yourself," answered Blueskin, "and so
I tell you, once for all, by G--I never will give you the watch,
no, nor will I ever hereafter surrender any part of my booty. I
won it, and I will wear it. Take your pistols yourself, and go out
on the highway, and don't lazily think to fatten yourself with the
dangers and pains of other people." At which words he departed in
a fierce mood, and repaired to the tavern used by the gang, where
he had appointed to meet some of his acquaintance, whom he
informed of what had passed between him and Wild, and advised them
all to follow his example; which they all readily agreed to, and
Mr. Wild's d--tion was the universal toast; in drinking bumpers to
which they had finished a large bowl of punch, when a constable,
with a numerous attendance, and Wild at their head, entered the
room and seized on Blueskin, whom his companions, when they saw
our hero, did not dare attempt to rescue. The watch was found upon
him, which, together with Wild's information, was more than
sufficient to commit him to Newgate.

In the evening Wild and the rest of those who had been drinking
with Blueskin met at the tavern, where nothing was to be seen but
the profoundest submission to their leader. They vilified and
abused Blueskin, as much as they had before abused our hero, and
now repeated the same toast, only changing the name of Wild into
that of Blueskin; all agreeing with Wild that the watch found in
his pocket, and which must be a fatal evidence against him, was a
just judgment on his disobedience and revolt.

Thus did this great man by a resolute and timely example (for he
went directly to the justice when Blueskin left him) quell one of
the most dangerous conspiracies which could possibly arise in a
gang, and which, had it been permitted one day's growth, would
inevitably have ended in his destruction; so much doth it behove
all great men to be eternally on their guard, and expeditious in
the execution of their purposes; while none but the weak and
honest can indulge themselves in remissness or repose.

The Achates, Fireblood, had been present at both these meetings;
but, though he had a little too hastily concurred in cursing his
friend, and in vowing his perdition, yet now he saw all that
scheme dissolved he returned to his integrity, of which he gave an
incontestable proof, by informing Wild of the measures which had
been concerted against him, in which he said he had pretended to
acquiesce, in order the better to betray them; but this, as he
afterwards confessed on his deathbed at Tyburn, was only a copy of
his countenance; for that he was, at that time, as sincere and
hearty in his opposition to Wild as any of his companions.

Our hero received Fireblood's information with a very placid
countenance. He said, as the gang had seen their errors, and
repented, nothing was more noble than forgiveness. But, though he
was pleased modestly to ascribe this to his lenity, it really
arose from much more noble and political principles. He considered
that it would be dangerous to attempt the punishment of so many;
besides, he flattered himself that fear would keep them in order:
and indeed Fireblood had told him nothing more than he knew
before, viz., that they were all complete prigs, whom he was to
govern by their fears, and in whom he was to place no more
confidence than was necessary, and to watch them with the utmost
caution and circumspection: for a rogue, he wisely said, like
gunpowder, must be used with caution; since both are altogether as
liable to blow up the party himself who uses them as to execute
his mischievous purpose against some other person or animal.

We will now repair to Newgate, it being the place where most of
the great men of this history are hastening as fast as possible;
and, to confess the truth, it is a castle very far from being an
improper or misbecoming habitation for any great man whatever. And
as this scene will continue during the residue of our history, we
shall open it with a new book, and shall therefore take this
opportunity of closing our third.




BOOK IV

CHAPTER ONE

SENTIMENT OF THE ORDINARY'S, WORTHY TO BE WRITTEN IN LETTERS OF
GOLD; A VERY EXTRAORDINARY INSTANCE OF FOLLY IN FRIENDLY, AND A
DREADFUL ACCIDENT WHICH BEFEL OUR HERO.


Heartfree had not been long in Newgate before his frequent
conversation with his children, and other instances of a good
heart, which betrayed themselves in his actions and conversation,
created an opinion in all about him that he was one of the
silliest fellows in the universe. The ordinary himself, a very
sagacious as well as very worthy person, declared that he was a
cursed rogue, but no conjuror.

What indeed might induce the former, i.e. the roguish part of this
opinion in the ordinary, was a wicked sentiment which Heartfree
one day disclosed in conversation, and which we, who are truly
orthodox, will not pretend to justify, that he believed a sincere
Turk would be saved. To this the good man, with becoming zeal and
indignation, answered, I know not what may become of a sincere
Turk; but, if this be your persuasion, I pronounce it impossible
you should be saved. No, sir; so far from a sincere Turk's being
within the pale of salvation, neither will any sincere
Presbyterian, Anabaptist, nor Quaker whatever, be saved.

But neither did the one nor the other part of this character
prevail on Friendly to abandon his old master. He spent his whole
time with him, except only those hours when he was absent for his
sake, in procuring evidence for him against his trial, which was
now shortly to come on. Indeed this young man was the only
comfort, besides a clear conscience and the hopes beyond the
grave, which this poor wretch had; for the sight of his children
was like one of those alluring pleasures which men in some
diseases indulge themselves often fatally in, which at once
flatter and heighten their malady.

Friendly being one day present while Heartfree was, with tears in
his eyes, embracing his eldest daughter, and lamenting the hard
fate to which he feared he should be obliged to leave her, spoke
to him thus: "I have long observed with admiration the magnanimity
with which you go through your own misfortunes, and the steady
countenance with which you look on death. I have observed that all
your agonies arise from the thoughts of parting with your
children, and of leaving them in a distrest condition; now, though
I hope all your fears will prove ill grounded, yet, that I may
relieve you as much as possible from them, be assured that, as
nothing can give me more real misery than to observe so tender and
loving a concern in a master, to whose goodness I owe so many
obligations, and whom I so sincerely love, so nothing can afford
me equal pleasure with my contributing to lessen or to remove it.
Be convinced, therefore, if you can place any confidence in my
promise, that I will employ my little fortune, which you know to
be not entirely inconsiderable, in the support of this your little
family. Should any misfortune, which I pray Heaven avert, happen
to you before you have better provided for these little ones, I
will be myself their father, nor shall either of them ever know
distress if it be any way in my power to prevent it. Your younger
daughter I will provide for, and as for my little prattler, your
elder, as I never yet thought of any woman for a wife, I will
receive her as such at your hands; nor will I ever relinquish her
for another." Heartfree flew to his friend, and embraced him with
raptures of acknowledgment. He vowed to him that he had eased
every anxious thought of his mind but one, and that he must carry
with him out of the world. "O Friendly!" cried he, "it is my
concern for that best of women, whom I hate myself for having ever
censured in my opinion. O Friendly! thou didst know her goodness;
yet, sure, her perfect character none but myself was ever
acquainted with. She had every perfection, both of mind and body,
which Heaven hath indulged to her whole sex, and possessed all in
a higher excellence than nature ever indulged to another in any
single virtue. Can I bear the loss of such a woman? Can I bear the
apprehensions of what mischiefs that villain may have done to her,
of which death is perhaps the lightest?" Friendly gently
interrupted him as soon as he saw any opportunity, endeavouring to
comfort him on this head likewise, by magnifying every
circumstance which could possibly afford any hopes of his seeing
her again.

By this kind of behaviour, in which the young man exemplified so
uncommon an height of friendship, he had soon obtained in the
castle the character of as odd and silly a fellow as his master.
Indeed they were both the byword, laughing-stock, and contempt of
the whole place.

The sessions now came on at the Old Bailey. The grand jury at
Hicks's-hall had found the bill of indictment against Heartfree,
and on the second day of the session he was brought to his trial;
where, notwithstanding the utmost efforts of Friendly and the
honest old female servant, the circumstances of the fact
corroborating the evidence of Fireblood, as well as that of Wild,
who counterfeited the most artful reluctance at appearing against
his old friend Heartfree, the jury found the prisoner guilty.

Wild had now accomplished his scheme; for as to remained, it was
certainly unavoidable, seeing Heartfree was entirely void of
interest with the and was besides convicted on a statute the
infringers of which could hope no pardon.

The catastrophe to which our hero had reduced this wretch was so
wonderful an effort of greatness, that it probably made Fortune
envious of her own darling; but whether it was from this envy, or
only from that known inconstancy and weakness so often and
judiciously remarked in that lady's temper, who frequently lifts
men to the summit of human greatness, only

  ut lapsu graviore ruant;

certain it is, she now began to meditate mischief against Wild,
who seems to have come to that period at which all heroes have
arrived, and which she was resolved they never should transcend.
In short, there seems to be a certain measure of mischief and
iniquity which every great man is to fill up, and then Fortune
looks on him of no more use than a silkworm whose bottom is spun,
and deserts him. Mr. Blueskin was convicted the same day of
robbery, by our hero, an unkindness which, though he had drawn on
himself, and necessitated him to, he took greatly amiss: as Wild,
therefore, was standing near him, with that disregard and
indifference which great men are too carelessly inclined to have
for those whom they have ruined, Blueskin, privily drawing a
knife, thrust the same into the body of our hero with such
violence, that all who saw it concluded he had done his business.
And, indeed, had not fortune, not so much out of love to our hero
as from a fixed resolution to accomplish a certain purpose, of
which we have formerly given a hint, carefully placed his guts out
of the way, he must have fallen a sacrifice to the wrath of his
enemy, which, as he afterwards said, he did not deserve; for, had
he been contented to have robbed and only submitted to give him
the booty, he might have still continued safe and unimpeached in
the gang; but, so it was, that the knife, missing noble parts (the
noblest of many) the guts, perforated only the hollow of his
belly, and caused no other harm than an immoderate effusion of
blood, of which, though it at present weakened him, he soon after
recovered.

This accident, however, was in the end attended with worse
consequences: for, as very few people (those greatest of all men,
absolute princes excepted) attempt to cut the thread of human
life, like the fetal sisters, merely out of wantonness and for
their diversion, but rather by so doing propose to themselves the
acquisition of some future good, or the avenging some past evil;
and as the former of these motives did not appear probable, it put
inquisitive persons on examining into the latter. Now, as the vast
schemes of Wild, when they were discovered, however great in their
nature, seemed to some persons, like the projects of most other
such persons, rather to be calculated for the glory of the great
man himself than to redound to the general good of society,
designs began to be laid by several of those who thought it
principally their duty to put a stop to the future progress of our
hero; and a learned judge particularly, a great enemy to this kind
of greatness, procured a clause in an Act of Parliament a trap for
Wild, which he soon after fell into. By this law it was made
capital in a prig to steal with the hands of other people. A law
so plainly calculated for the destruction of all priggish
greatness, that it was indeed impossible for our hero to avoid it.




CHAPTER TWO

A SHORT HINT CONCERNING POPULAR INGRATITUDE. MR. WILD'S ARRIVAL IN
THE CASTLE, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES TO BE FOUND IN NO OTHER
HISTORY.


If we had any leisure we would here digress a little on that
ingratitude which so many writers have observed to spring up in
the people in all free governments towards their great men; who,
while they have been consulting the good of the public, by raising
their own greatness, in which the whole body (as the kingdom of
France thinks itself in the glory of their grand monarch) was so
deeply concerned, have been sometimes sacrificed by those very
people for whose glory the said great men were so industriously at
work: and this from a foolish zeal for a certain ridiculous
imaginary thing called liberty, to which great men are observed to
have a great animosity.

This law had been promulgated a very little time when Mr. Wild,
having received from some dutiful members of the gang a valuable
piece of goods, did, for a consideration somewhat short of its
original price, re-convey it to the right owner; for which fact,
being ungratefully informed against by the said owner, he was
surprized in his own house, and, being overpowered by numbers, was
hurried before a magistrate, and by him committed to that castle,
which, suitable as it is to greatness, we do not chuse to name too
often in our history, and where many great men at this time
happened to be assembled.

The governor, or, as the law more honourably calls him, keeper of
this castle, was Mr. Wild's old friend and acquaintance. This made
the latter greatly satisfied with the place of his confinement, as
he promised himself not only a kind reception and handsome
accommodation there, but even to obtain his liberty from him if he
thought it necessary to desire it: but, alas! he was deceived; his
old friend knew him no longer, and refused to see him, and the
lieutenant-governor insisted on as high garnish for fetters, and
as exorbitant a price for lodging, as if he had had a fine
gentleman in custody for murder, or any other genteel crime.

To confess a melancholy truth, it is a circumstance much to be
lamented, that there is no absolute dependence on the friendship
of great men; an observation which hath been frequently made by
those who have lived in courts, or in Newgate, or in any other
place set apart for the habitation of such persons.

The second day of his confinement he was greatly surprized at
receiving a visit from his wife; and more so, when, instead of a
countenance ready to insult him, the only motive to which he could
ascribe her presence, he saw the tears trickling down her lovely
cheeks. He embraced her with the utmost marks of affection, and
declared he could hardly regret his confinement, since it had
produced such an instance of the happiness he enjoyed in her,
whose fidelity to him on this occasion would, be believed, make
him the envy of most husbands, even in Newgate. He then begged her
to dry her eyes, and be comforted; for that matters might go
better with him than she expected. "No, no," says she, "I am
certain you would be found guilty. DEATH. I knew what it would
always come to. I told you it was impossible to carry on such a
trade long; but you would not be advised, and now you see the
consequence-now you repent when it is too late. All the comfort I
shall have when you are NUBBED [Footnote: The cant word for
hanging.] is, that I gave you a good advice. If you had always
gone out by yourself, as I would have had you, you might have
robbed on to the end of the chapter; but you was wiser than all
the world, or rather lazier, and see what your laziness is come
to--to the CHEAT, [Footnote: The gallows.] for thither you will go
now, that's infallible. And a just judgment on you for following
your headstrong will; I am the only person to be pitied; poor I,
who shall be scandalised for your fault. THERE GOES SHE WHOSE
HUSBAND WAS HANGED: methinks I hear them crying so already." At
which words she burst into tears. He could not then forbear
chiding her for this unnecessary concern on his account, and
begged her not to trouble him any more. She answered with some
spirit, "On your account, and be d--d to you! No, if the old cull
of a justice had not sent me hither, I believe it would have been
long enough before I should have come hither to see after you; d--
n me, I am committed for the FILINGLAY, [Footnote: Picking
pockets.] man, and we shall be both nubbed together. 'I faith, my
dear, it almost makes me amends for being nubbed myself, to have
the pleasure of seeing thee nubbed too." "Indeed, my dear,"
answered Wild, "it is what I have long wished for thee; but I do
not desire to bear thee company, and I have still hopes to have
the pleasure of seeing you go without me; at least I will have the
pleasure to be rid of you now." And so saying, he seized her by
the waist, and with strong arm flung her out of the room; but not
before she had with her nails left a bloody memorial on his cheek:
and thus this fond couple parted.

Wild had scarce recovered himself from the uneasiness into which
this unwelcome visit, proceeding from the disagreeable fondness of
his wife, had thrown him, than the faithful Achates appeared. The
presence of this youth was indeed a cordial to his spirits. He
received him with open arms, and expressed the utmost satisfaction
in the fidelity of his friendship, which so far exceeded the
fashion of the times, and said many things which we have forgot on
the occasion; but we remember they all tended to the praise of
Fireblood, whose modesty, at length, put a stop to the torrent of
compliments, by asserting he had done no more than his duty, and
that he should have detested himself could he have forsaken his
friend in his adversity; and, after many protestations that he
came the moment he heard of his misfortune, he asked him if he
could be of any service. Wild answered, since he had so kindly
proposed that question, he must say he should be obliged to him if
he could lend him a few guineas; for that he was very seedy.
Fireblood replied that he was greatly unhappy in not having it
then in his power, adding many hearty oaths that he had not a
farthing of money in his pocket, which was, indeed, strictly true;
for he had only a bank-note, which he had that evening purloined
from a gentleman in the playhouse passage. He then asked for his
wife, to whom, to speak truly, the visit was intended, her
confinement being the misfortune of which he had just heard; for,
as for that of Mr. Wild himself, he had known it from the first
minute, without ever intending to trouble him with his company.
Being informed therefore of the visit which had lately happened,
he reproved Wild for his cruel treatment of that good creature;
then, taking as sudden a leave as he civilly could of the
gentleman, he hastened to comfort his lady, who received him with
great kindness.




CHAPTER THREE

CURIOUS ANECDOTES RELATING TO THE HISTORY OF NEWGATE.


There resided in the castle at the same time with Mr. Wild one
Roger Johnson, a very GREAT MAN, who had long been at the head of
all the prigs in Newgate, and had raised contributions on them. He
examined into the nature of their defence, procured and instructed
their evidence, and made himself, at least in their opinion, so
necessary to them, that the whole fate of Newgate seemed entirely
to depend upon him.

Wild had not been long in confinement before he began to oppose
this man. He represented him to the prigs as a fellow who, under
the plausible pretence of assisting their causes, was in reality
undermining THE LIBERTIES OF NEWGATE. He at first threw out
certain sly hints and insinuations; but, having by degrees formed
a party against Roger, he one day assembled them together, and
spoke to them in the following florid manner:

"Friends and fellow-citizens,--The cause which I am to mention to
you this day is of such mighty importance, that when I consider my
own small abilities, I tremble with an apprehension lest your
safety may be rendered precarious by the weakness of him who hath
undertaken to represent to you your danger. Gentlemen, the liberty
of Newgate is at stake; your privileges have been long undermined,
and are now openly violated by one man; by one who hath engrossed
to himself the whole conduct of your trials, under colour of which
he exacts what contributions on you he pleases; but are those sums
appropriated to the uses for which they are raised? Your frequent
convictions at the Old Bailey, those depredations of justice, must
too sensibly and sorely demonstrate the contrary. What evidence
doth he ever produce for the prisoner which the prisoner himself
could not have provided, and often better instructed? How many
noble youths have there been lost when a single alibi would have
saved them! Should I be silent, nay, could your own injuries want
a tongue to remonstrate, the very breath which by his neglect hath
been stopped at the cheat would cry out loudly against him. Nor is
the exorbitancy of his plunders visible only in the dreadful
consequences it hath produced to the prigs, nor glares it only in
the miseries brought on them: it blazes forth in the more
desirable effects it hath wrought for himself, in the rich
perquisites acquired by it: witness that silk nightgown, that robe
of shame, which, to his eternal dishonour, he publicly wears; that
gown which I will not scruple to call the winding-sheet of the
liberties of Newgate. Is there a prig who hath the interest and
honour of Newgate so little at heart that he can refrain from
blushing when he beholds that trophy, purchased with the breath of
so many prigs? Nor is this all. His waistcoat embroidered with
silk, and his velvet cap, bought with the same price, are ensigns
of the same disgrace. Some would think the rags which covered his
nakedness when first he was committed hither well exchanged for
these gaudy trappings; but in my eye no exchange can be profitable
when dishonour is the condition. If, therefore, Newgate--" Here the
only copy which we could procure of this speech breaks off
abruptly; however, we can assure the reader, from very authentic
information, that he concluded with advising the prigs to put
their affairs into other hands. After which, one of his party, as
had been before concerted, in a very long speech recommended him
(Wild himself) to their choice.

Newgate was divided into parties on this occasion, the prigs on
each side representing their chief or great man to be the only
person by whom the affairs of Newgate could be managed with safety
and advantage. The prigs had indeed very incompatible interests;
for, whereas the supporters of Johnson, who was in possession of
the plunder of Newgate, were admitted to some share under their
leader, so the abettors of Wild had, on his promotion, the same
views of dividing some part of the spoil among themselves. It is
no wonder, therefore, they were both so warm on each side. What
may seem more remarkable was, that the debtors, who were entirely
unconcerned in the dispute, and who were the destined plunder of
both parties, should interest themselves with the utmost violence,
some on behalf of Wild, and others in favour of Johnson. So that
all Newgate resounded with WILD for ever, JOHNSON for ever. And
the poor debtors re-echoed THE LIBERTIES OF NEWGATE, which, in the
cant language, signifies plunder, as loudly as the thieves
themselves. In short, such quarrels and animosities happened
between them, that they seemed rather the people of two countries
long at war with each other than the inhabitants of the same
castle.

Wild's party at length prevailed, and he succeeded to the place
and power of Johnson, whom he presently stripped of all his
finery; but, when it was proposed that he should sell it and
divide the money for the good of the whole, he waved that motion,
saying it was not yet time, that he should find a better
opportunity, that the cloathes wanted cleaning, with many other
pretences, and within two days, to the surprize of many, he
appeared in them himself; for which he vouchsafed no other apology
than that they fitted him much better than they did Johnson, and
that they became him in a much more elegant manner.

This behaviour of Wild greatly incensed the debtors, particularly
those by whose means he had been promoted. They grumbled
extremely, and vented great indignation against Wild; when one day
a very grave man, and one of much authority among them, bespake
them as follows:

"Nothing sure can be more justly ridiculous than the conduct of
those who should lay the lamb in the wolfs way, and then should
lament his being devoured. What a wolf is in a sheep-fold, a great
man is in society. Now, when one wolf is in possession of a sheep-
fold, how little would it avail the simple flock to expel him and
place another in his stead! Of the same benefit to us is the
overthrowing one prig in favour of another. And for what other
advantage was your struggle? Did you not all know that Wild and
his followers were prigs, as well as Johnson and his? What then
could the contention be among such but that which you have now
discovered it to have been? Perhaps some would say, Is it then our
duty tamely to submit to the rapine of the prig who now plunders
us for fear of an exchange? Surely no: but I answer, It is better
to shake the plunder off than to exchange the plunderer. And by
what means can we effect this but by a total change in our
manners? Every prig is a slave. His own priggish desires, which
enslave him, themselves betray him to the tyranny of others. To
preserve, therefore, the liberty of Newgate is to change the
manners of Newgate. Let us, therefore, who are confined here for
debt only, separate ourselves entirely from the prigs; neither
drink with them nor converse with them. Let us at the same time
separate ourselves farther from priggism itself. Instead of being
ready, on every opportunity, to pillage each other, let us be
content with our honest share of the common bounty, and with the
acquisition of our own industry. When we separate from the prigs,
let us enter into a closer alliance with one another. Let us
consider ourselves all as members of one community, to the public
good of which we are to sacrifice our private views; not to give
up the interest of the whole for every little pleasure or profit
which shall accrue to ourselves. Liberty is consistent with no
degree of honesty inferior to this, and the community where this
abounds no prig will have the impudence or audaciousness to
endeavour to enslave; or if he should, his own destruction would
be the only consequence of his attempt. But while one man pursues
his ambition, another his interest, another his safety; while one
hath a roguery (a priggism they here call it) to commit, and
another a roguery to defend; they must naturally fly to the favour
and protection of those who have power to give them what they
desire, and to defend them from what they fear; nay, in this view
it becomes their interest to promote this power in their patrons.
Now, gentlemen, when we are no longer prigs, we shall no longer
have these fears or these desires. What remains, therefore, for us
but to resolve bravely to lay aside our priggism, our roguery, in
plainer words, and preserve our liberty, or to give up the latter
in the preservation and preference of the former?"

This speech was received with much applause; however, Wild
continued as before to levy contributions among the prisoners, to
apply the garnish to his own use, and to strut openly in the
ornaments which he had stripped from Johnson. To speak sincerely,
there was more bravado than real use or advantage in these
trappings. As for the nightgown, its outside indeed made a
glittering tinsel appearance, but it kept him not warm, nor could
the finery of it do him much honour, since every one knew it did
not properly belong to him; as to the waistcoat, it fitted him
very ill, being infinitely too big for him; and the cap was so
heavy that it made his head ache. Thus these cloathes, which
perhaps (as they presented the idea of their misery more sensibly
to the people's eyes) brought him more envy, hatred, and
detraction, than all his deeper impositions and more real
advantages, afforded very little use or honour to the wearer; nay,
could scarce serve to amuse his own vanity when this was cool
enough to reflect with the least seriousness. And, should I speak
in the language of a man who estimated human happiness without
regard to that greatness, which we have so laboriously endeavoured
to paint in this history, it is probable he never took (i.e.
robbed the prisoners of) a shilling, which he himself did not pay
too dear for.




CHAPTER FOUR

THE DEAD-WARRANT ARRIVES FOR HEARTFREE; ON WHICH OCCASION WILD
BETRAYS SOME HUMAN WEAKNESS.


The dead-warrant, as it is called, now came down to Newgate for
the execution of Heartfree among the rest of the prisoners. And
here the reader must excuse us, who profess to draw natural, not
perfect characters, and to record the truths of history, not the
extravagances of romance, while we relate a weakness in Wild of
which we are ourselves ashamed, and which we would willingly have
concealed, could we have preserved at the same time that strict
attachment to truth and impartiality, which we have professed in
recording the annals of this great man. Know then, reader, that
this dead-warrant did not affect Heartfree, who was to suffer a
shameful death by it, with half the concern it gave Wild, who had
been the occasion of it. He had been a little struck the day
before on seeing the children carried away in tears from their
father. This sight brought the remembrance of some slight injuries
he had done the father to his mind, which he endeavoured as much
as possible to obliterate; but, when one of the keepers (I should
say lieutenants of the castle) repeated Heartfree's name among
those of the malefactors who were to suffer within a few days, the
blood forsook his countenance, and in a cold still stream moved
heavily to his heart, which had scarce strength enough left to
return it through his veins. In short, his body so visibly
demonstrated the pangs of his mind, that to escape observation he
retired to his room, where he sullenly gave vent to such bitter
agonies, that even the injured Heartfree, had not the apprehension
of what his wife had suffered shut every avenue of compassion,
would have pitied him.

When his mind was thoroughly fatigued, and worn out with the
horrors which the approaching fate of the poor wretch, who lay
under a sentence which he had iniquitously brought upon him, had
suggested, sleep promised him relief; but this promise was, alas!
delusive. This certain friend to the tired body is often the
severest enemy to the oppressed mind. So at least it proved to
Wild, adding visionary to real horrors, and tormenting his
imagination with phantoms too dreadful to be described. At length,
starting from these visions, he no sooner recovered his waking
senses, than he cryed out--"I may yet prevent this catastrophe. It
is not too late to discover the whole." He then paused a moment;
but greatness, instantly returning to his assistance, checked the
base thought, as it first offered itself to his mind. He then
reasoned thus coolly with himself:--"Shall I, like a child, or a
woman, or one of those mean wretches whom I have always despised,
be frightened by dreams and visionary phantoms to sully that
honour which I have so difficultly acquired and so gloriously
maintained? Shall I, to redeem the worthless life of this silly
fellow, suffer my reputation to contract a stain which the blood
of millions cannot wipe away? Was it only that the few, the simple
part of mankind, should call me a rogue, perhaps I could submit;
but to be for ever contemptible to the prigs, as a wretch who
wanted spirit to execute my undertaking, can never be digested.
What is the life of a single man? Have not whole armies and
nations been sacrificed to the honour of ONE GREAT MAN? Nay, to
omit that first class of greatness, the conquerors of mankind, how
often have numbers fallen by a fictitious plot only to satisfy the
spleen, or perhaps exercise the ingenuity, of a member of that
second order of greatness the ministerial! What have I done then?
Why, I have ruined a family, and brought an innocent man to the
gallows. I ought rather to weep with Alexander that n salutations admit of, and told me he should likewise
remember my arrival at his cave to the last day of his life,
adding, O that he could there spend the whole in the company of
one whose bright eyes had kindled--but I know you will think, sir,
that we women love to repeat the compliments made us, I will
therefore omit them. In a word, the sailors being now arrived, I
quitted him with some compassion for the reluctance with which he
parted from me, and went forward with my companions.

"We had proceeded but a very few paces before one of the sailors
said to his comrades, 'D--n me, Jack, who knows whether yon fellow
hath not some good flip in his cave?' I innocently answered, The
poor wretch hath only one bottle of brandy. 'Hath he so?' cries
the sailor; ''fore George, we will taste it;' and so saying they
immediately returned back, and myself with them. We found the poor
man prostrate on the ground, expressing all the symptoms of misery
and lamentation. I told him in French (for the sailors could not
speak that language) what they wanted. He pointed to the place
where the bottle was deposited, saying they were welcome to that
and whatever else he had, and added he cared not if they took his
life also. The sailors searched the whole cave, where finding
nothing more which they deemed worth their taking, they walked off
with the bottle, and, immediately emptying it without offering me
a drop, they proceeded with me towards the town.

"In our way I observed one whisper another, while he kept his eye
stedfastly fixed on me. This gave me some uneasiness; but the
other answered, 'No, d--n me, the captain will never forgive us:
besides, we have enough of it among the black women, and, in my
mind, one colour is as good as another.' This was enough to give
me violent apprehensions; but I heard no more of that kind till we
came to the town, where, in about six hours, I arrived in safety.

"As soon as I came to the captain he enquired what was become of
my friend, meaning the villanous count. When he was informed by me
of what had happened, he wished me heartily joy of my delivery,
and, expressing the utmost abhorrence of such baseness, swore if
ever he met him he would cut his throat; but, indeed, we both
concluded that he had died of the blow which the hermit had given
him.

"I was now introduced to the chief magistrate of this country, who
was desirous of seeing me. I will give you a short description of
him. He was chosen (as is the custom there) for his superior
bravery and wisdom. His power is entirely absolute during his
continuance; but, on the first deviation from equity and justice,
he is liable to be deposed and punished by the people, the elders
of whom, once a year assemble to examine into his conduct. Besides
the danger which these examinations, which are very strict, expose
him to, his office is of such care and trouble that nothing but
that restless love of power so predominant in the mind of man
could make it the object of desire, for he is indeed the only
slave of all the natives of this country. He is obliged, in time
of peace, to hear the complaint of every person in his dominions
and to render him justice; for which purpose every one may demand
an audience of him, unless during the hour which he is allowed for
dinner, when he sits alone at the table, and is attended in the
most public manner with more than European ceremony. This is done
to create an awe and respect towards him in the eye of the vulgar;
but lest it should elevate him too much in his own opinion, in
order to his humiliation he receives every evening in private,
from a kind of beadle, a gentle kick on his posteriors; besides
which he wears a ring in his nose, somewhat resembling that we
ring our pigs with, and a chain round his neck not unlike that
worn by our aldermen; both which I suppose to be emblematical, but
heard not the reasons of either assigned. There are many more
particularities among these people which, when I have an
opportunity, I may relate to you. The second day after my return
from court one of his officers, whom they call SCHACH PIMPACH,
waited upon me, and, by a French interpreter who lives here,
informed me that the chief magistrate liked my person, and offered
me an immense present if I would suffer him to enjoy it (this is,
it seems, their common form of making love). I rejected the
present, and never heard any further solicitations; for, as it is
no shame for women here to consent at the first proposal, so they
never receive a second.

"I had resided in this town a week when the captain informed me
that a number of slaves, who had been taken captives in war, were
to be guarded to the sea-side, where they were to be sold to the
merchants who traded in them to America; that if I would embrace
this opportunity I might assure myself of finding a passage to
America, and thence to England; acquainting me at the same time
that he himself intended to go with them. I readily agreed to
accompany him. The chief, being advertised of our designs, sent
for us both to court, and, without mentioning a word of love to
me, having presented me with a very rich jewel, of less value, he
said, than my chastity, took a very civil leave, recommending me
to the care of heaven, and ordering us a large supply of
provisions for our journey.

"We were provided with mules for ourselves and what we carried
with us, and in nine days reached the sea-shore, where we found an
English vessel ready to receive both us and the slaves. We went
aboard it, and sailed the next day with a fair wind for New
England, where I hoped to get an immediate passage to the Old: but
Providence was kinder than my expectation; for the third day after
we were at sea we met an English man-of-war homeward bound; the
captain of it was a very good-natured man, and agreed to take me
on board. I accordingly took my leave of my old friend, the master
of the shipwrecked vessel, who went on to New England, whence he
intended to pass to Jamaica, where his owners lived. I was now
treated with great civility, had a little cabin assigned me, and
dined every day at the captain's table, who was indeed a very
gallant man, and at first, made me a tender of his affections;
but, when he found me resolutely bent to preserve myself pure and
entire for the best of husbands, he grew cooler in his addresses,
and soon behaved in a manner very pleasing to me, regarding my sex
only so far as to pay me a deference, which is very agreeable to
us all.

"To conclude my story; I met with no adventure in this passage at
all worth relating, till my landing at Gravesend, whence the
captain brought me in his own boat to the Tower. In a short hour
after my arrival we had that meeting which, however dreadful at
first, will, I now hope, by the good offices of the best of men,
whom Heaven for ever bless, end in our perfect happiness, and be a
strong instance of what I am persuaded is the surest truth, THAT
PROVIDENCE WILL SOONER OR LATER PROCURE THE FELICITY OF THE
VIRTUOUS AND INNOCENT."

Mrs. Heartfree thus ended her speech, having before delivered to
her husband the jewels which the count had robbed him of, and that
presented her by the African chief, which last was of immense
value. The good magistrate was sensibly touched at her narrative,
as well on the consideration of the sufferings she had herself
undergone as for those of her husband, which he had himself been
innocently the instrument of bringing upon him. That worthy man,
however, much rejoiced in what he had already done for his
preservation, and promised to labour with his utmost interest and
industry to procure the absolute pardon, rather of his sentence
than of his guilt, which he now plainly discovered was a barbarous
and false imputation.




CHAPTER TWELVE

THE HISTORY RETURNS TO THE CONTEMPLATION OF GREATNESS.


But we have already, perhaps, detained our reader too long in this
relation from the consideration of our hero, who daily gave the
most exalted proofs of greatness in cajoling the prigs, and in
exactions on the debtors; which latter now grew so great, i. e.,
corrupted in their morals, that they spoke with the utmost
contempt of what the vulgar call honesty. The greatest character
among them was that of a pickpocket, or, in truer language, a
file; and the only censure was want of dexterity. As to virtue,
goodness, and such like, they were the objects of mirth and
derision, and all Newgate was a complete collection of prigs,
every man being desirous to pick his neighbour's pocket, and every
one was as sensible that his neighbour was as ready to pick his;
so that (which is almost incredible) as great roguery was daily
committed within the walls of Newgate as without.

The glory resulting from these actions of Wild probably animated
the envy of his enemies against him. The day of his trial now
approached; for which, as Socrates did, he prepared himself; but
not weakly and foolishly, like that philosopher, with patience and
resignation, but with a good number of false witnesses. However,
as success is not always proportioned to the wisdom of him who
endeavours to attain it, so are we more sorry than ashamed to
relate that our hero was, notwithstanding his utmost caution and
prudence, convicted, and sentenced to a death which, when we
consider not only the great men who have suffered it, but the much
larger number of those whose highest honour it hath been to merit
it, we cannot call otherwise than honourable. Indeed, those who
have unluckily missed it seem all their days to have laboured in
vain to attain an end which Fortune, for reasons only known to
herself, hath thought proper to deny them. Without any farther
preface then, our hero was sentenced to be hanged by the neck:
but, whatever was to be now his fate, he might console himself
that he had perpetrated what

  ---------Nec Judicis ira, nec ignis.
   Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolera vetustas.

For my own part, I confess, I look on this death of hanging to be
as proper for a hero as any other; and I solemnly declare that had
Alexander the Great been hanged it would not in the least have
diminished my respect to his memory. Provided a hero in his life
doth but execute a sufficient quantity of mischief; provided he be
but well and heartily cursed by the widow, the orphan, the poor,
and the oppressed (the sole rewards, as many authors have bitterly
lamented both in prose and verse, of greatness, i. e., priggism),
I think it avails little of what nature his death be, whether it
be by the axe, the halter, or the sword. Such names will be always
sure of living to posterity, and of enjoying that fame which they
so gloriously and eagerly coveted; for, according to a GREAT
dramatic poet--

  Fame

   Not more survives from good than evil deeds.
   Th' aspiring youth that fired th' Ephesian dome
   Outlives in fame the pious fool who rais'd it

Our hero now suspected that the malice of his enemies would
overpower him. He therefore betook himself to that true support of
greatness in affliction, a bottle; by means of which he was
enabled to curse, swear, and bully, and brave his fate. Other
comfort indeed he had not much, for not a single friend ever came
near him. His wife, whose trial was deferred to the next sessions,
visited him but once, when she plagued, tormented, and upbraided
him so cruelly, that he forbad the keeper ever to admit her again.
The ordinary of Newgate had frequent conferences with him, and
greatly would it embellish our history could we record all which
that good man delivered on these occasions; but unhappily we could
procure only the substance of a single conference, which was taken
down in shorthand by one who overheard it. We shall transcribe it
therefore exactly in the same form and words we received it; nor
can we help regarding it as one of the most curious pieces which
either ancient or modern history hath recorded.




CHAPTER THIRTEEN

A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE ORDINARY OF NEWGATE AND MR. JONATHAN WILD
THE GREAT; IN WHICH THE SUBJECTS OF DEATH, IMMORTALITY, AND OTHER
GRAVE MATTERS, ARE VERY LEARNEDLY HANDLED BY THE FORMER.


ORDINARY. Good morrow to you, sir; I hope you rested well last
night.

JONATHAN. D--n'd ill, sir. I dreamt so confoundedly of hanging,
that it disturbed my sleep.

ORDINARY. Fie upon it! You should be more resigned. I wish you
would make a little better use of those instructions which I have
endeavoured to inculcate into you, and particularly last Sunday,
and from these words: "Those who do evil shall go into everlasting
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." I undertook to shew
you, first, what is meant by EVERLASTING FIRE; and, secondly, who
were THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. I then proceeded to draw some
inferences from the whole; [Footnote: He pronounced this word
HULL, and perhaps would have spelt it so.] in which I am mightily
deceived if I did not convince you that you yourself was one of
those ANGELS, and, consequently, must expect EVERLASTING FIRE to
be your portion in the other world.

JONATHAN. Faith, doctor, I remember very little of your
inferences; for I fell asleep soon after your naming your text.
But did you preach this doctrine then, or do you repeat it now in
order to comfort me?

ORDINARY. I do it in order to bring you to a true sense of your
manifold sins, and, by that means, to induce you to repentance.
Indeed, had I the eloquence of Cicero, or of Tully, it would not
be sufficient to describe the pains of hell or the joys of heaven.
The utmost that we are taught is, THAT EAR HATH NOT HEARD, NOR CAN
HEART CONCEIVE. Who then would, for the pitiful consideration of
the riches and pleasures of this world, forfeit such inestimable
happiness! such joys! such pleasures! such delights? Or who would
run the venture of such misery, which, but to think on, shocks the
human understanding? Who, in his senses, then, would prefer the
latter to the former?

JONATHAN. Ay, who indeed? I assure you, doctor, I had much rather
be happy than miserable. But [Footnote: This part was so blotted
that it was illegible.]

       .       .       .       .       .       .       .

ORDINARY. Nothing can be plainer. St. . . .

JONATHAN. You ... to frighten me out of my wits. But the good ...
is, I doubt not, more merciful than his wicked.. If I should
believe all you say, I am sure I should die in inexpressible
horrour.

ORDINARY. Despair is sinful. You should place your hopes in
repentance and grace; and though it is most true that you are in
danger of the judgment, yet there is still room for mercy; and no
man, unless excommunicated, is absolutely without hopes of a
reprieve.

JONATHAN. I am not without hopes of a reprieve from the cheat yet.
I have pretty good interest; but if I cannot obtain it, you shall
not frighten me out of my courage. I will not die like a pimp. D--
n me, what is death? It is nothing but to be with Platos and with
Caesars, as the poet says, and all the other great heroes of
antiquity. ...

ORDINARY. Ay, all this is very true; but life is sweet for all
that; and I had rather live to eternity than go into the company
of any such heathens, who are, I doubt not, in hell with the devil
and his angels; and, as little as you seem to apprehend it, you
may find yourself there before you expect it. Where, then, will be
your tauntings and your vauntings, your boastings and your
braggings? You will then be ready to give more for a drop of water
than you ever gave for a bottle of wine.

JONATHAN. Faith, doctor! well minded. What say you to a bottle of
wine?

ORDINARY. I will drink no wine with an atheist. I should expect
the devil to make a third in such company, for, since he knows you
are his, he may be impatient to have his due.

JONATHAN. It is your business to drink with the wicked, in order
to amend them.

ORDINARY. I despair of it; and so I consign you over to the devil,
who is ready to receive you.

JONATHAN. You are more unmerciful to me than the judge, doctor. He
recommended my soul to heaven; and it is your office to shew me
the way thither.

ORDINARY. No: the gates are barred against all revilers of the
clergy.

JONATHAN. I revile only the wicked ones, if any such are, which
cannot affect you, who, if men were preferred in the church by
merit only, would have long since been a bishop. Indeed, it might
raise any good man's indignation to observe one of your vast
learning and abilities obliged to exert them in so low a sphere,
when so many of your inferiors wallow in wealth and preferment.

ORDINARY. Why, it must be confessed that there are bad men in all
orders; but you should not censure too generally. I must own I
might have expected higher promotion; but I have learnt patience
and resignation; and I would advise you to the same temper of
mind; which if you can attain, I know you will find mercy. Nay, I
do now promise you you will. It is true you are a sinner; but your
crimes are not of the blackest dye: you are no murderer, nor
guilty of sacrilege. And, if you are guilty of theft, you make
some atonement by suffering for it, which many others do not.
Happy is it indeed for those few who are detected in their sins,
and brought to exemplary punishment for them in this world. So
far, therefore, from repining at your fate when you come to the
tree, you should exult and rejoice in it; and, to say the truth, I
question whether, to a wise man, the catastrophe of many of those
who die by a halter is not more to be envied than pitied. Nothing
is so sinful as sin, and murder is the greatest of all sins. It
follows, that whoever commits murder is happy in suffering for it.
If, therefore, a man who commits murder is so happy in dying for
it, how much better must it be for you, who have committed a less
crime!

JONATHAN. All this is very true; but let us take a bottle of wine
to cheer our spirits.

ORDINARY. Why wine? Let me tell you, Mr. Wild, there is nothing so
deceitful as the spirits given us by wine. If you must drink, let
us have a bowl of punch--a liquor I the rather prefer, as it is
nowhere spoken against in Scripture, and as it is more wholesome
for the gravel, a distemper with which I am grievously afflicted.

JONATHAN (having called for a bowl). I ask your pardon, doctor; I
should have remembered that punch was your favourite liquor. I
think you never taste wine while there is any punch remaining on
the table.

ORDINARY. I confess I look on punch to be the more eligible
liquor, as well for the reasons I before mentioned as likewise for
one other cause, viz., it is the properest for a DRAUGHT. I own I
took it a little unkind of you to mention wine, thinking you knew
my palate.

JONATHAN. You are in the right; and I will take a swinging cup to
your being made a bishop.

ORDINARY. And I will wish you a reprieve in as large a draught.
Come, don't despair; it is yet time enough to think of dying; you
have good friends, who very probably may prevail for you. I have
known many a man reprieved who had less reason to expect it.

JONATHAN. But if I should flatter myself with such hopes, and be
deceived--what then would become of my soul?

ORDINARY. Pugh! Never mind your soul--leave that to me; I will
render a good account of it, I warrant you. I have a sermon in my
pocket which may be of some use to you to hear. I do not value
myself on the talent of preaching, since no man ought to value
himself for any gift in this world. But perhaps there are not many
such sermons. But to proceed, since we have nothing else to do
till the punch comes. My text is the latter part of a verse only:

---To the Greeks FOOLISHNESS.

The occasion of these words was principally that philosophy of the
Greeks which at that time had overrun great part of the heathen
world, had poisoned, and, as it were, puffed up their minds with
pride, so that they disregarded all kinds of doctrine in
comparison of their own; and, however safe and however sound the
learning of the others might be, yet, if it anywise contradicted
their own laws, customs, and received opinions, AWAY WITH IT--IT
IS NOT FOR US. It was to the Greeks FOOLISHNESS.

In the former part, therefore, of my discourse on these words, I
shall principally confine myself to the laying open and
demonstrating the great emptiness and vanity of this philosophy,
with which these idle and absurd sophists were so proudly blown up
and elevated.

And here I shall do two things: First, I shall expose the matter;
and, secondly, the manner of this absurd philosophy.

And first, for the first of these, namely, the matter. Now here we
may retort the unmannerly word which our adversaries have
audaciously thrown in our faces; for what was all this mighty
matter of philosophy, this heap of knowledge, which was to bring
such large harvests of honour to those who sowed it, and so
greatly and nobly to enrich the ground on which it fell; what was
it but FOOLISHNESS? An inconsistent heap of nonsense, of
absurdities and contradictions, bringing no ornament to the mind
in its theory, nor exhibiting any usefulness to the body in its
practice. What were all the sermons and the savings, the fables
and the morals of all these wise men, but, to use the word
mentioned in my text once more, FOOLISHNESS? What was their great
master Plato, or their other great light Aristotle? Both fools,
mere quibblers and sophists, idly and vainly attached to certain
ridiculous notions of their own, founded neither on truth nor on
reason. Their whole works are a strange medley of the greatest
falsehoods, scarce covered over with the colour of truth: their
precepts are neither borrowed from nature nor guided by reason;
mere fictions, serving only to evince the dreadful height of human
pride; in one word, FOOLISHNESS. It may be perhaps expected of me
that I should give some instances from their works to prove this
charge; but, as to transcribe every passage to my purpose would be
to transcribe their whole works, and as in such a plentiful crop
it is difficult to chuse; instead of trespassing on your patience,
I shall conclude this first head with asserting what I have so
fully proved, and what may indeed be inferred from the text, that
the philosophy of the Greeks was FOOLISHNESS.

Proceed we now, in the second place, to consider the manner in
which this inane and simple doctrine was propagated. And here--But
here the punch by entring waked Mr. Wild, who was fast asleep, and
put an end to the sermon; nor could we obtain any further account
of the conversation which passed at this interview.




CHAPTER FOURTEEN

WILD PROCEEDS TO THE HIGHEST CONSUMMATION OF HUMAN GREATNESS.


The day now drew nigh when our great man was to exemplify the last
and noblest act of greatness by which any hero can signalise
himself. This was the day of execution, or consummation, or
apotheosis (for it is called by different names), which was to
give our hero an opportunity of facing death and damnation,
without any fear in his heart, or, at least, without betraying any
symptoms of it in his countenance. A completion of greatness which
is heartily to be wished to every great man; nothing being more
worthy of lamentation than when Fortune, like a lazy poet, winds
up her catastrophe aukwardly, and, bestowing too little care on
her fifth act, dismisses the hero with a sneaking and private
exit, who had in the former part of the drama performed such
notable exploits as must promise to every good judge among the
spectators a noble, public, and exalted end.

But she was resolved to commit no such error in this instance. Our
hero was too much and too deservedly her favourite to be neglected
by her in his last moments; accordingly all efforts for a reprieve
were vain, and the name of Wild stood at the head of those who
were ordered for execution.

From the time he gave over all hopes of life, his conduct was
truly great and admirable. Instead of shewing any marks of
dejection or contrition, he rather infused more confidence and
assurance into his looks. He spent most of his hours in drinking
with his friends and with the good man above commemorated. In one
of these compotations, being asked whether he was afraid to die,
he answered, "D--n me, it is only a dance without music." Another
time, when one expressed some sorrow for his misfortune, as he
termed it, he said with great fierceness--"A man can die but
once." Again, when one of his intimate acquaintance hinted his
hopes, that he would die like a man, he cocked his hat in
defiance, and cried out greatly--"Zounds! who's afraid?"

Happy would it have been for posterity, could we have retrieved
any entire conversation which passed at this season, especially
between our hero and his learned comforter; but we have searched
many pasteboard records in vain.

On the eve of his apotheosis, Wild's lady desired to see him, to
which he consented. This meeting was at first very tender on both
sides; but it could not continue so, for unluckily, some hints of
former miscarriages intervening, as particularly when she asked
him how he could have used her so barbarously once as calling her
b--, and whether such language became a man, much less a
gentleman, Wild flew into a violent passion, and swore she was the
vilest of b--s to upbraid him at such a season with an unguarded
word spoke long ago. She replied, with many tears, she was well
enough served for her folly in visiting such a brute; but she had
one comfort, however, that it would be the last time he could ever
treat her so; that indeed she had some obligation to him, for that
his cruelty to her would reconcile her to the fate he was to-
morrow to suffer; and, indeed, nothing but such brutality could
have made the consideration of his shameful death (so this weak
woman called hanging), which was now inevitable, to be borne even
without madness. She then proceeded to a recapitulation of his
faults in an exacter order, and with more perfect memory, than one
would have imagined her capable of; and it is probable would have
rehearsed a complete catalogue had not our hero's patience failed
him, so that with the utmost fury and violence he caught her by
the hair and kicked her, as heartily as his chains would suffer
him, out of the room.

At length the morning came which Fortune at his birth had
resolutely ordained for the consummation of our hero's GREATNESS:
he had himself indeed modestly declined the public honour she
intended him, and had taken a quantity of laudanum, in order to
retire quietly off the stage; but we have already observed, in the
course of our wonderful history, that to struggle against this
lady's decrees is vain and impotent; and whether she hath
determined you shall be hanged or be a prime minister, it is in
either case lost labour to resist. Laudanum, therefore, being
unable to stop the breath of our hero, which the fruit of hemp-
seed, and not the spirit of poppy-seed, was to overcome, he was at
the usual hour attended by the proper gentleman appointed for that
purpose, and acquainted that the cart was ready. On this occasion
he exerted that greatness of courage which hath been so much
celebrated in other heroes; and, knowing it was impossible to
resist, he gravely declared he would attend them. He then
descended to that room where the fetters of great men are knocked
off in a most solemn and ceremonious manner. Then shaking hands
with his friends (to wit, those who were conducting him to the
tree), and drinking their healths in a bumper of brandy, he
ascended the cart, where he was no sooner seated than he received
the acclamations of the multitude, who were highly ravished with
his GREATNESS.

The cart now moved slowly on, being preceded by a troop of horse-
guards bearing javelins in their hands, through streets lined with
crowds all admiring the great behaviour of our hero, who rode on,
sometimes sighing, sometimes swearing, sometimes singing or
whistling, as his humour varied.

When he came to the tree of glory, he was welcomed with an
universal shout of the people, who were there assembled in
prodigious numbers to behold a sight much more rare in populous
cities than one would reasonably imagine it should be, viz., the
proper catastrophe of a great man.

But though envy was, through fear, obliged to join the general
voice in applause on this occasion, there were not wanting some
who maligned this completion of glory, which was now about to be
fulfilled to our hero, and endeavoured to prevent it by knocking
him on the head as he stood under the tree, while the ordinary was
performing his last office. They therefore began to batter the
cart with stones, brick-bats, dirt, and all manner of mischievous
weapons, some of which, erroneously playing on the robes of the
ecclesiastic, made him so expeditious in his repetition, that with
wonderful alacrity he had ended almost in an instant, and conveyed
himself into a place of safety in a hackney-coach, where he waited
the compulsion with a temper of mind described in these verses:

    Suave mari magno, turbantibus aequora ventis,
     E terra alterius magnum spectare laborem.

We must not, however, omit one circumstance, as it serves to shew
the most admirable conservation of character in our hero to his
last moment, which was, that, whilst the ordinary was busy in his
ejaculations, Wild, in the midst of the shower of stones, &c.,
which played upon him, applied his hands to the parson's pocket,
and emptied it of his bottle-screw, which he carried out of the
world in his hand.

The ordinary being now descended from the cart, Wild had just
opportunity to cast his eyes around the crowd, and to give them a
hearty curse, when immediately the horses moved on, and with
universal applause our hero swung out of this world.

Thus fell Jonathan Wild the GREAT, by a death as glorious as his
life had been, and which was so truly agreeable to it, that the
latter must have been deprobably maimed and imperfect without the
former; a death which hath been alone wanting to complete the
characters of several ancient and modern heroes, whose histories
would then have been read with much greater pleasure by the wisest
in all ages. Indeed we could almost wish that whenever Fortune
seems wantonly to deviate from her purpose, and leaves her work
imperfect in this particular, the historian would indulge himself
in the license of poetry and romance, and even do a violence to
truth, to oblige his reader with a page which must be the most
delightful in all his history, and which could never fail of
producing an instructive moral.

Narrow minds may possibly have some reason to be ashamed of going
this way out of the world, if their consciences can fly in their
faces and assure them they have not merited such an honour; but he
must be a fool who is ashamed of being hanged, who is not weak
enough to be ashamed of having deserved it.




CHAPTER FIFTEEN

THE CHARACTER OF OUR HERO, AND THE CONCLUSION OF THIS HISTORY.


We will now endeavour to draw the character of this great man;
and, by bringing together those several features as it were of his
mind which lie scattered up and down in this history, to present
our readers with a perfect picture of greatness.

Jonathan Wild had every qualification necessary to form a great
man. As his most powerful and predominant passion was ambition, so
nature had, with consummate propriety, adapted all his faculties
to the attaining those glorious ends to which this passion
directed him. He was extremely ingenious in inventing designs,
artful in contriving the means to accomplish his purposes, and
resolute in executing them: for as the most exquisite cunning and
most undaunted boldness qualified him for any undertaking, so was
he not restrained by any of those weaknesses which disappoint the
views of mean and vulgar souls, and which are comprehended in one
general term of honesty, which is a corruption of HONOSTY, a word
derived from what the Greeks call an ass. He was entirely free
from those low vices of modesty and good-nature, which, as he
said, implied a total negation of human greatness, and were the
only qualities which absolutely rendered a man incapable of making
a considerable figure in the world. His lust was inferior only to
his ambition; but, as for what simple people call love, he knew
not what it was. His avarice was immense, but it was of the
rapacious, not of the tenacious kind; his rapaciousness was indeed
so violent, that nothing ever contented him but the whole; for,
however considerable the share was which his coadjutors allowed
him of a booty, he was restless in inventing means to make himself
master of the smallest pittance reserved by them. He said laws
were made for the use of prigs only, and to secure their property;
they were never therefore more perverted than when their edge was
turned against these; but that this generally happened through
their want of sufficient dexterity. The character which he most
valued himself upon, and which he principally honoured in others,
was that of hypocrisy. His opinion was, that no one could carry
priggism very far without it; for which reason, he said, there was
little greatness to be expected in a man who acknowledged his
vices, but always much to be hoped from him who professed great
virtues: wherefore, though he would always shun the person whom he
discovered guilty of a good action, yet he was never deterred by a
good character, which was more commonly the effect of profession
than of action: for which reason, he himself was always very
liberal of honest professions, and had as much virtue and goodness
in his mouth as a saint; never in the least scrupling to swear by
his honour, even to those who knew him the best; nay, though he
held good-nature and modesty in the highest contempt, he
constantly practised the affectation of both, and recommended this
to others, whose welfare, on his own account, he wished well to.
He laid down several maxims as the certain methods of attaining
greatness, to which, in his own pursuit of it, he constantly
adhered. As--

1. Never to do more mischief to another than was necessary to the
effecting his purpose; for that mischief was too precious a thing
to be thrown away.

2. To know no distinction of men from affection; but to sacrifice
all with equal readiness to his interest.

3. Never to communicate more of an affair than was necessary to
the person who was to execute it.

4. Not to trust him who hath deceived you, nor who knows he hath
been deceived by you.

5. To forgive no enemy; but to be cautious and often dilatory in
revenge.

6. To shun poverty and distress, and to ally himself as close as
possible to power and riches.

7. To maintain a constant gravity in his countenance and
behaviour, and to affect wisdom on all occasions.

8. To foment eternal jealousies in his gang, one of another.

9. Never to reward any one equal to his merit; but always to
insinuate that the reward was above it.

10. That all men were knaves or fools, and much the greater number
a composition of both.

11. That a good name, like money, must be parted with, or at least
greatly risqued, in order to bring the owner any advantage.

12. That virtues, like precious stones, were easily counterfeited;
that the counterfeits in both cases adorned the wearer equally,
and that very few had knowledge or discernment sufficient to
distinguish the counterfeit jewel from the real.

13. That many men were undone by not going deep enough in roguery;
as in gaming any man may be a loser who doth not play the whole
game.

14. That men proclaim their own virtues, as shopkeepers expose
their goods, in order to profit by them.

15. That the heart was the proper seat of hatred, and the
countenance of affection and friendship.

He had many more of the same kind, all equally good with these,
and which were after his decease found in his study, as the twelve
excellent and celebrated rules were in that of king Charles the
first; for he never promulgated them in his lifetime, not having
them constantly in his mouth, as some grave persons have the rules
of virtue and morality, without paying the least regard to them in
their actions: whereas our hero, by a constant and steady
adherence to his rules in conforming everything he did to them,
acquired at length a settled habit of walking by them, till at
last he was in no danger of inadvertently going out of the way;
and by these means he arrived at that degree of greatness, which
few have equalled; none, we may say, have exceeded: for, though it
must be allowed that there have been some few heroes, who have
done greater mischiefs to mankind, such as those who have betrayed
the liberty of their country to others, or have undermined and
overpowered it themselves; or conquerors who have impoverished,
pillaged, sacked, burnt, and destroyed the countries and cities of
their fellow-creatures, from no other provocation than that of
glory, i. e., as the tragic poet calls it,

           a privilege to kill,
   A strong temptation to do bravely ill;

yet, if we consider it in the light wherein actions are placed in
this line,

  Laetius est, quoties magno tibi constat honestum;

when we see our hero, without the least assistance or pretence,
setting himself at the head of a gang, which he had not any shadow
of right to govern; if we view him maintaining absolute power, and
exercising tyranny over a lawless crew, contrary to all law but
that of his own will; if we consider him setting up an open trade
publickly, in defiance not only of the laws of his country but of
the common sense of his countrymen; if we see him first contriving
the robbery of others, and again the defrauding the very robbers
of that booty, which they had ventured their necks to acquire, and
which without any hazard, they might have retained; here sure he
must appear admirable, and we may challenge not only the truth of
history, but almost the latitude of fiction, to equal his glory.

Nor had he any of those flaws in his character which, though they
have been commended by weak writers, have (as I hinted in the
beginning of this history) by the judicious reader been censured
and despised. Such was the clemency of Alexander and Caesar, which
nature had so grossly erred in giving them, as a painter would who
should dress a peasant in robes of state or give the nose or any
other feature of a Venus to a satyr. What had the destroyers of
mankind, that glorious pair, one of whom came into the world to
usurp the dominion and abolish the constitution of his own
country; the other to conquer, enslave, and rule over the whole
world, at least as much as was well known to him, and the
shortness of his life would give him leave to visit; what had, I
say, such as these to do with clemency? Who cannot see the
absurdity and contradiction of mixing such an ingredient with
those noble and great qualities I have before mentioned? Now, in
Wild everything was truly great, almost without alloy, as his
imperfections (for surely some small ones he had) were only such
as served to denominate him a human creature, of which kind none
ever arrived at consummate excellence. But surely his whole
behaviour to his friend Heartfree is a convincing proof that the
true iron or steel greatness of his heart was not debased by any
softer metal. Indeed, while greatness consists in power, pride,
insolence, and doing mischief to mankind--to speak out--while a
great man and a great rogue are synonymous terms, so long shall
Wild stand unrivalled on the pinnacle of GREATNESS. Nor must we
omit here, as the finishing of his character, what indeed ought to
be remembered on his tomb or his statue, the conformity above
mentioned of his death to his life; and that Jonathan Wild the
Great, after all his mighty exploits, was, what so few GREAT men
can accomplish--hanged by the neck till he was dead.

Having thus brought our hero to his conclusion, it may be
satisfactory to some readers (for many, I doubt not, carry their
concern no farther than his fate) to know what became of
Heartfree. We shall acquaint them, therefore, that his sufferings
were now at an end; that the good magistrate easily prevailed for
his pardon, nor was contented till he had made him all the
reparation he could for his troubles, though the share he had in
bringing these upon him was not only innocent but from its motive
laudable. He procured the restoration of the jewels from the man-
of-war at her return to England, and, above all, omitted no labour
to restore Heartfree to his reputation, and to persuade his
neighbours, acquaintance, and customers, of his innocence. When
the commission of bankruptcy was satisfied, Heartfree had a
considerable sum remaining; for the diamond presented to his wife
was of prodigious value, and infinitely recompensed the loss of
those jewels which Miss Straddle had disposed of. He now set up
again in his trade: compassion for his unmerited misfortunes
brought him many customers among those who had any regard to
humanity; and he hath, by industry joined with parsimony, amassed
a considerable fortune. His wife and he are now grown old in the
purest love and friendship, but never had another child. Friendly
married his elder daughter at the age of nineteen, and became his
partner in trade. As to the younger, she never would listen to the
addresses of any lover, not even of a young nobleman, who offered
to take her with two thousand pounds, which her father would have
willingly produced, and indeed did his utmost to persuade her to
the match; but she refused absolutely, nor would give any other
reason, when Heartfree pressed her, than that she had dedicated
her days to his service, and was resolved no other duty should
interfere with that which she owed the best of fathers, nor
prevent her from being the nurse of his old age.

Thus Heartfree, his wife, his two daughters, his son-in-law, and
his grandchildren, of which he hath several, live all together in
one house; and that with such amity and affection towards each
other, that they are in the neighbourhood called the family of
love.

As to all the other persons mentioned in this history in the light
of greatness, they had all the fate adapted to it, being every one
hanged by the neck, save two, viz., Miss Theodosia Snap, who was
transported to America, where she was pretty well married,
reformed, and made a good wife; and the count, who recovered of
the wound he had received from the hermit and made his escape into
France, where he committed a robbery, was taken, and broke on the
wheel.

Indeed, whoever considers the common fate of great men must allow
they well deserve and hardly earn that applause which is given
them by the world; for, when we reflect on the labours and pains,
the cares, disquietudes, and dangers which attend their road to
greatness, we may say with the divine that a man may go to heaven
with half the pains which it costs him to purchase hell. To say
the truth, the world have this reason at least to honour such
characters as that of Wild: that, while it is in the power of
every man to be perfectly honest, not one in a thousand is capable
of being a complete rogue; and few indeed there are who, if they
were inspired with the vanity of imitating our hero, would not
after much fruitless pains be obliged to own themselves inferior
to MR. JONATHAN WILD THE GREAT.

GENERAL INTRODUCTION.


There are few amusements more dangerous for an author than the
indulgence in ironic descriptions of his own work. If the irony is
depreciatory, posterity is but too likely to say, "Many a true word is
spoken in jest;" if it is encomiastic, the same ruthless and ungrateful
critic is but too likely to take it as an involuntary confession of
folly and vanity. But when Fielding, in one of his serio-comic
introductions to _Tom Jones_, described it as "this prodigious work," he
all unintentionally (for he was the least pretentious of men)
anticipated the verdict which posterity almost at once, and with
ever-increasing suffrage of the best judges as time went on, was about
to pass not merely upon this particular book, but upon his whole genius
and his whole production as a novelist. His work in other kinds is of a
very different order of excellence. It is sufficiently interesting at
times in itself; and always more than sufficiently interesting as his;
for which reasons, as well as for the further one that it is
comparatively little known, a considerable selection from it is offered
to the reader in the last two volumes of this edition. Until the present
occasion (which made it necessary that I should acquaint myself with
it) I own that my own knowledge of these miscellaneous writings was by
no means thorough. It is now pretty complete; but the idea which I
previously had of them at first and second hand, though a little
improved, has not very materially altered. Though in all this hack-work
Fielding displayed, partially and at intervals, the same qualities which
he displayed eminently and constantly in the four great books here
given, he was not, as the French idiom expresses it, _dans son
assiette_, in his own natural and impregnable disposition and situation
of character and ability, when he was occupied on it. The novel was for
him that _assiette_; and all his novels are here.

Although Henry Fielding lived in quite modern times, although by family
and connections he was of a higher rank than most men of letters, and
although his genius was at once recognised by his contemporaries so soon
as it displayed itself in its proper sphere, his biography until very
recently was by no means full; and the most recent researches, including
those of Mr Austin Dobson--a critic unsurpassed for combination of
literary faculty and knowledge of the eighteenth century--have not
altogether sufficed to fill up the gaps. His family, said to have
descended from a member of the great house of Hapsburg who came to
England in the reign of Henry II., distinguished itself in the Wars of
the Roses, and in the seventeenth century was advanced to the peerages
of Denbigh in England and (later) of Desmond in Ireland. The novelist
was the grandson of John Fielding, Canon of Salisbury, the fifth son of
the first Earl of Desmond of this creation. The canon's third son,
Edmond, entered the army, served under Marlborough, and married Sarah
Gold or Gould, daughter of a judge of the King's Bench. Their eldest son
was Henry, who was born on April 22, 1707, and had an uncertain number
of brothers and sisters of the whole blood. After his first wife's
death, General Fielding (for he attained that rank) married again. The
most remarkable offspring of the first marriage, next to Henry, was his
sister Sarah, also a novelist, who wrote David Simple; of the second,
John, afterwards Sir John Fielding, who, though blind, succeeded his
half-brother as a Bow Street magistrate, and in that office combined an
equally honourable record with a longer tenure.

Fielding was born at Sharpham Park in Somersetshire, the seat of his
maternal grandfather; but most of his early youth was spent at East
Stour in Dorsetshire, to which his father removed after the judge's
death. He is said to have received his first education under a parson of
the neighbourhood named Oliver, in whom a very uncomplimentary tradition
sees the original of Parson Trulliber. He was then certainly sent to
Eton, where he did not waste his time as regards learning, and made
several valuable friends. But the dates of his entering and leaving
school are alike unknown; and his subsequent sojourn at Leyden for two
years--though there is no reason to doubt it--depends even less upon
any positive documentary evidence. This famous University still had a
great repute as a training school in law, for which profession he was
intended; but the reason why he did not receive the even then far more
usual completion of a public school education by a sojourn at Oxford or
Cambridge may be suspected to be different. It may even have had
something to do with a curious escapade of his about which not very much
is known--an attempt to carry off a pretty heiress of Lyme, named
Sarah Andrew.

Even at Leyden, however, General Fielding seems to have been unable or
unwilling to pay his son's expenses, which must have been far less there
than at an English University; and Henry's return to London in 1728-29
is said to have been due to sheer impecuniosity. When he returned to
England, his father was good enough to make him an allowance of L200
nominal, which appears to have been equivalent to L0 actual. And as
practically nothing is known of him for the next six or seven years,
except the fact of his having worked industriously enough at a large
number of not very good plays of the lighter kind, with a few poems and
miscellanies, it is reasonably enough supposed that he lived by his pen.
The only product of this period which has kept (or indeed which ever
received) competent applause is _Tom Thumb, or the Tragedy of
Tragedies_, a following of course of the _Rehearsal_, but full of humour
and spirit. The most successful of his other dramatic works were the
_Mock Doctor_ and the _Miser_, adaptations of Moliere's famous pieces.
His undoubted connection with the stage, and the fact of the
contemporary existence of a certain Timothy Fielding, helped suggestions
of less dignified occupations as actor, booth-keeper, and so forth; but
these have long been discredited and indeed disproved.

In or about 1735, when Fielding was twenty-eight, we find him in a new,
a more brilliant and agreeable, but even a more transient phase. He had
married (we do not know when or where) Miss Charlotte Cradock, one of
three sisters who lived at Salisbury (it is to be observed that
Fielding's entire connections, both in life and letters, are with the
Western Counties and London), who were certainly of competent means, and
for whose alleged illegitimacy there is no evidence but an unsupported
fling of that old maid of genius, Richardson. The descriptions both of
Sophia and of Amelia are said to have been taken from this lady; her
good looks and her amiability are as well established as anything of the
kind can be in the absence of photographs and affidavits; and it is
certain that her husband was passionately attached to her, during their
too short married life. His method, however, of showing his affection
smacked in some ways too much of the foibles which he has attributed to
Captain Booth, and of those which we must suspect Mr Thomas Jones would
also have exhibited, if he had not been adopted as Mr Allworthy's heir,
and had not had Mr Western's fortune to share and look forward to. It is
true that grave breaches have been made by recent criticism in the very
picturesque and circumstantial story told on the subject by Murphy, the
first of Fielding's biographers. This legend was that Fielding, having
succeeded by the death of his mother to a small estate at East Stour,
worth about L200 a year, and having received L1500 in ready money as his
wife's fortune, got through the whole in three years by keeping open
house, with a large retinue in "costly yellow liveries," and so forth.
In details, this story has been simply riddled. His mother had died long
before; he was certainly not away from London three years, or anything
like it; and so forth. At the same time, the best and soberest judges
agree that there is an intrinsic probability, a consensus (if a vague
one) of tradition, and a chain of almost unmistakably personal
references in the novels, which plead for a certain amount of truth, at
the bottom of a much embellished legend. At any rate, if Fielding
established himself in the country, it was not long before he returned
to town; for early in 1736 we find him back again, and not merely a
playwright, but lessee of the "Little Theatre" in the Haymarket. The
plays which he produced here--satirico-political pieces, such as
_Pasquin_ and the _Historical Register_--were popular enough, but
offended the Government; and in 1737 a new bill regulating theatrical
performances, and instituting the Lord Chamberlain's control, was
passed. This measure put an end directly to the "Great Mogul's Company,"
as Fielding had called his troop, and indirectly to its manager's career
as a playwright. He did indeed write a few pieces in future years, but
they were of the smallest importance.

After this check he turned at last to a serious profession, entered
himself of the Middle Temple in November of the same year, and was
called three years later; but during these years, and indeed for some
time afterwards, our information about him is still of the vaguest
character. Nobody doubts that he had a large share in the _Champion_, an
essay-periodical on the usual eighteenth-century model, which began to
appear in 1739, and which is still occasionally consulted for the work
that is certainly or probably his. He went the Western Circuit, and
attended the Wiltshire Sessions, after he was called, giving up his
contributions to periodicals soon after that event. But he soon returned
to literature proper, or rather made his _debut_ in it, with the
immortal book now republished. The _History of the Adventures of Joseph
Andrews, and his Friend Mr Abraham Adams_, appeared in February 1742,
and its author received from Andrew Millar, the publisher, the sum of
L183, 11s. Even greater works have fetched much smaller sums; but it
will be admitted that _Joseph Andrews_ was not dear.

The advantage, however, of presenting a survey of an author's life
uninterrupted by criticism is so clear, that what has to be said about
_Joseph_ may be conveniently postponed for the moment. Immediately after
its publication the author fell back upon miscellaneous writing, and in
the next year (1743) collected and issued three volumes of
_Miscellanies_. In the two first volumes the only thing of much interest
is the unfinished and unequal, but in part powerful, _Journey from this
World to the Next_, an attempt of a kind which Fontenelle and others,
following Lucian, had made very popular with the time. But the third
volume of the _Miscellanies_ deserved a less modest and gregarious
appearance, for it contained, and is wholly occupied by, the wonderful
and terrible satire of _Jonathan Wild_, the greatest piece of pure irony
in English out of Swift. Soon after the publication of the book, a great
calamity came on Fielding. His wife had been very ill when he wrote the
preface; soon afterwards she was dead. They had taken the chance, had
made the choice, that the more prudent and less wise student-hero and
heroine of Mr Browning's _Youth and Art_ had shunned; they had no doubt
"sighed deep, laughed free, Starved, feasted, despaired," and we need
not question, that they had also "been happy."

Except this sad event and its rather incongruous sequel, Fielding's
marriage to his wife's maid Mary Daniel--a marriage, however, which did
not take place till full four years later, and which by all accounts
supplied him with a faithful and excellent companion and nurse, and his
children with a kind stepmother--little or nothing is again known of
this elusive man of genius between the publication of the _Miscellanies_
in 1743, and that of _Tom Jones_ in 1749. The second marriage itself in
November 1747; an interview which Joseph Warton had with him rather more
than a year earlier (one of the very few direct interviews we have); the
publication of two anti-Jacobite newspapers (Fielding was always a
strong Whig and Hanoverian), called the _True Patriot_ and the
_Jacobite's Journal_ in 1745 and the following years; some indistinct
traditions about residences at Twickenham and elsewhere, and some, more
precise but not much more authenticated, respecting patronage by the
Duke of Bedford, Mr Lyttelton, Mr Allen, and others, pretty well sum up
the whole.

_Tom Jones_ was published in February (a favourite month with Fielding
or his publisher Millar) 1749; and as it brought him the, for those
days, very considerable sum of L600 to which Millar added another
hundred later, the novelist must have been, for a time at any rate,
relieved from his chronic penury. But he had already, by Lyttelton's
interest, secured his first and last piece of preferment, being made
Justice of the Peace for Westminster, an office on which he entered with
characteristic vigour. He was qualified for it not merely by a solid
knowledge of the law, and by great natural abilities, but by his
thorough kindness of heart; and, perhaps, it may also be added, by his
long years of queer experience on (as Mr Carlyle would have said) the
"burning marl" of the London Bohemia. Very shortly afterwards he was
chosen Chairman of Quarter Sessions, and established himself in Bow
Street. The Bow Street magistrate of that time occupied a most singular
position, and was more like a French Prefect of Police or even a
Minister of Public Safety than a mere justice. Yet he was ill paid.
Fielding says that the emoluments, which before his accession had but
been L500 a year of "dirty" money, were by his own action but L300 of
clean; and the work, if properly performed, was very severe.

That he performed it properly all competent evidence shows, a foolish,
inconclusive, and I fear it must be said emphatically snobbish story of
Walpole's notwithstanding. In particular, he broke up a gang of
cut-throat thieves, which had been the terror of London. But his tenure
of the post was short enough, and scarcely extended to five years. His
health had long been broken, and he was now constantly attacked by gout,
so that he had frequently to retreat on Bath from Bow Street, or his
suburban cottage of Fordhook, Ealing. But he did not relax his literary
work. His pen was active with pamphlets concerning his office; _Amelia_,
his last novel, appeared towards the close of 1751; and next year saw
the beginning of a new paper, the _Covent Garden Journal_, which
appeared twice a week, ran for the greater part of the year, and died in
November. Its great author did not see that month twice again. In the
spring of 1753 he grew worse; and after a year's struggle with ill
health, hard work, and hard weather, lesser measures being pronounced
useless, was persuaded to try the "Portugal Voyage," of which he has
left so charming a record in the _Journey to Lisbon_. He left Fordhook
on June 26, 1754, reached Lisbon in August, and, dying there on the 8th
of October, was buried in the cemetery of the Estrella.

Of not many writers perhaps does a clearer notion, as far as their
personality goes, exist in the general mind that interests itself at all
in literature than of Fielding. Yet more than once a warning has been
sounded, especially by his best and most recent biographer, to the
effect that this idea is founded upon very little warranty of scripture.
The truth is, that as the foregoing record--which, brief as it is, is a
sufficiently faithful summary--will have shown, we know very little
about Fielding. We have hardly any letters of his, and so lack the best
by far and the most revealing of all character-portraits; we have but
one important autobiographic fragment, and though that is of the highest
interest and value, it was written far in the valley of the shadow of
death, it is not in the least retrospective, and it affords but dim and
inferential light on his younger, healthier, and happier days and ways.
He came, moreover, just short of one set of men of letters, of whom we
have a great deal of personal knowledge, and just beyond another. He was
neither of those about Addison, nor of those about Johnson. No intimate
friend of his has left us anything elaborate about him. On the other
hand, we have a far from inconsiderable body of documentary evidence, of
a kind often by no means trustworthy. The best part of it is contained
in the letters of his cousin, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and the
reminiscences or family traditions of her grand-daughter, Lady Louisa
Stuart. But Lady Mary, vivacious and agreeable as she is, had with all
her talent a very considerable knack of writing for effect, of drawing
strong contrasts and the like; and it is not quite certain that she saw
very much of Fielding in the last and most interesting third of his
life. Another witness, Horace Walpole, to less knowledge and equally
dubious accuracy, added decided ill-will, which may have been due partly
to the shrinking of a dilettante and a fop from a burly Bohemian; but I
fear is also consequent upon the fact that Horace could not afford to
despise Fielding's birth, and knew him to be vastly his own superior in
genius. We hear something of him again from Richardson; and Richardson
hated him with the hatred of dissimilar genius, of inferior social
position, and, lastly, of the cat for the dog who touzles and worries
her. Johnson partly inherited or shared Richardson's aversion, partly
was blinded to Fielding's genius by his aggressive Whiggery. I fear,
too, that he was incapable of appreciating it for reasons other than
political. It is certain that Johnson, sane and robust as he was, was
never quite at ease before genius of the gigantic kind, either in dead
or living. Whether he did not like to have to look up too much, or was
actually unable to do so, it is certain that Shakespeare, Milton,
Swift, and Fielding, those four Atlantes of English verse and prose, all
affected him with lukewarm admiration, or with positive dislike, for
which it is vain to attempt to assign any uniform secondary cause,
political or other. It may be permitted to hint another reason. All
Johnson's most sharp-sighted critics have noticed, though most have
discreetly refrained from insisting on, his "thorn-in-the-flesh," the
combination in him of very strong physical passions with the deepest
sense of the moral and religious duty of abstinence. It is perhaps
impossible to imagine anything more distasteful to a man so buffeted,
than the extreme indulgence with which Fielding regards, and the easy
freedom, not to say gusto, with which he depicts, those who succumb to
similar temptation. Only by supposing the workings of some subtle
influence of this kind is it possible to explain, even in so capricious
a humour as Johnson's, the famous and absurd application of the term
"barren rascal" to a writer who, dying almost young, after having for
many years lived a life of pleasure, and then for four or five one of
laborious official duty, has left work anything but small in actual
bulk, and fertile with the most luxuriant growth of intellectual
originality.

Partly on the _obiter dicta_ of persons like these, partly on the still
more tempting and still more treacherous ground of indications drawn
from his works, a Fielding of fantasy has been constructed, which in
Thackeray's admirable sketch attains real life and immortality as a
creature of art, but which possesses rather dubious claims as a
historical character. It is astonishing how this Fielding of fantasy
sinks and shrivels when we begin to apply the horrid tests of criticism
to his component parts. The _eidolon_, with inked ruffles and a towel
round his head, sits in the Temple and dashes off articles for the
_Covent Garden Journal_; then comes Criticism, hellish maid, and reminds
us that when the _Covent Garden Journal_ appeared, Fielding's wild oats,
if ever sown at all, had been sown long ago; that he was a busy
magistrate and householder in Bow Street; and that, if he had towels
round his head, it was probably less because he had exceeded in liquor
than because his Grace of Newcastle had given him a headache by wanting
elaborate plans and schemes prepared at an hour's notice. Lady Mary,
apparently with some envy, tells us that he could "feel rapture with his
cook-maid." "Which many has," as Mr Ridley remarks, from Xanthias
Phoceus downwards; but when we remember the historic fact that he
married this maid (not a "cook-maid" at all), and that though he always
speaks of her with warm affection and hearty respect, such "raptures" as
we have of his clearly refer to a very different woman, who was both a
lady and a beautiful one, we begin a little to shake our heads. Horace
Walpole at second-hand draws us a Fielding, pigging with low companions
in a house kept like a hedge tavern; Fielding himself, within a year or
two, shows us more than half-undesignedly in the _Voyage to Lisbon_ that
he was very careful about the appointments and decency of his table,
that he stood rather upon ceremony in regard to his own treatment of his
family, and the treatment of them and himself by others, and that he was
altogether a person orderly, correct, and even a little finikin. Nor is
there the slightest reasonable reason to regard this as a piece of
hypocrisy, a vice as alien from the Fielding of fancy as from the
Fielding of fact, and one the particular manifestation of which, in this
particular place, would have been equally unlikely and unintelligible.

It may be asked whether I propose to substitute for the traditional
Fielding a quite different person, of regular habits and methodical
economy. Certainly not. The traditional estimate of great men is rarely
wrong altogether, but it constantly has a habit of exaggerating and
dramatising their characteristics. For some things in Fielding's career
we have positive evidence of document, and evidence hardly less certain
of probability. Although I believe the best judges are now of opinion
that his impecuniosity has been overcharged, he certainly had
experiences which did not often fall to the lot of even a cadet of good
family in the eighteenth century. There can be no reasonable doubt that
he was a man who had a leaning towards pretty girls and bottles of good
wine; and I should suppose that if the girl were kind and fairly
winsome, he would not have insisted that she should possess Helen's
beauty, that if the bottle of good wine were not forthcoming, he would
have been very tolerant of a mug of good ale. He may very possibly have
drunk more than he should, and lost more than he could conveniently pay.
It may be put down as morally ascertained that towards all these
weaknesses of humanity, and others like unto them, he held an attitude
which was less that of the unassailable philosopher than that of the
sympathiser, indulgent and excusing. In regard more especially to what
are commonly called moral delinquencies, this attitude was so decided
as to shock some people even in those days, and many in these. Just when
the first sheets of this edition were passing through the press, a
violent attack was made in a newspaper correspondence on the morality of
_Tom Jones_ by certain notorious advocates of Purity, as some say, of
Pruriency and Prudery combined, according to less complimentary
estimates. Even midway between the two periods we find the admirable
Miss Ferrier, a sister of Fielding's own craft, who sometimes had
touches of nature and satire not far inferior to his own, expressing by
the mouth of one of her characters with whom she seems partly to agree,
the sentiment that his works are "vanishing like noxious exhalations."
Towards any misdoing by persons of the one sex towards persons of the
other, when it involved brutality or treachery, Fielding was pitiless;
but when treachery and brutality were not concerned, he was, to say the
least, facile. So, too, he probably knew by experience--he certainly
knew by native shrewdness and acquired observation--that to look too
much on the wine when it is red, or on the cards when they are
parti-coloured, is ruinous to health and fortune; but he thought not
over badly of any man who did these things. Still it is possible to
admit this in him, and to stop short of that idea of a careless and
reckless _viveur_ which has so often been put forward. In particular,
Lady Mary's view of his childlike enjoyment of the moment has been, I
think, much exaggerated by posterity, and was probably not a little
mistaken by the lady herself. There are two moods in which the motto is
_Carpe diem_, one a mood of simply childish hurry, the other one where
behind the enjoyment of the moment lurks, and in which the enjoyment of
the moment is not a little heightened by, that vast ironic consciousness
of the before and after, which I at least see everywhere in the
background of Fielding's work.

The man, however, of whom we know so little, concerns us much less than
the author of the works, of which it only rests with ourselves to know
everything. I have above classed Fielding as one of the four Atlantes of
English verse and prose, and I doubt not that both the phrase and the
application of it to him will meet with question and demur. I have only
to interject, as the critic so often has to interject, a request to the
court to take what I say in the sense in which I say it. I do not mean
that Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, and Fielding are in all or even in most
respects on a level. I do not mean that the three last are in all
respects of the greatest names in English literature. I only mean that,
in a certain quality, which for want of a better word I have chosen to
call Atlantean, they stand alone. Each of them, for the metaphor is
applicable either way, carries a whole world on his shoulders, or looks
down on a whole world from his natural altitude. The worlds are
different, but they are worlds; and though the attitude of the giants is
different also, it agrees in all of them on the points of competence and
strength. Take whomsoever else we may among our men of letters, and we
shall find this characteristic to be in comparison wanting. These four
carry their world, and are not carried by it; and if it, in the language
so dear to Fielding himself, were to crash and shatter, the inquiry,
"_Que vous reste-t-il?_" could be answered by each, "_Moi!_"

The appearance which Fielding makes is no doubt the most modest of the
four. He has not Shakespeare's absolute universality, and in fact not
merely the poet's tongue, but the poet's thought seems to have been
denied him. His sphere is not the ideal like Milton's. His irony,
splendid as it is, falls a little short of that diabolical magnificence
which exalts Swift to the point whence, in his own way, he surveys all
the kingdoms of the world, and the glory or vainglory of them. All
Fielding's critics have noted the manner, in a certain sense modest, in
another ostentatious, in which he seems to confine himself to the
presentation of things English. They might have added to the
presentation of things English--as they appear in London, and on the
Western Circuit, and on the Bath Road.

But this apparent parochialism has never deceived good judges. It did
not deceive Lady Mary, who had seen the men and manners of very many
climes; it did not deceive Gibbon, who was not especially prone to
overvalue things English, and who could look down from twenty centuries
on things ephemeral. It deceives, indeed, I am told, some excellent
persons at the present day, who think Fielding's microcosm a "toylike
world," and imagine that Russian Nihilists and French Naturalists have
gone beyond it. It will deceive no one who has lived for some competent
space of time a life during which he has tried to regard his
fellow-creatures and himself, as nearly as a mortal may, _sub specie
aeternitatis_.

As this is in the main an introduction to a complete reprint of
Fielding's four great novels, the justification in detail of the
estimate just made or hinted of the novelist's genius will be best and
most fitly made by a brief successive discussion of the four as they are
here presented, with some subsequent remarks on the _Miscellanies_ here
selected. And, indeed, it is not fanciful to perceive in each book a
somewhat different presentment of the author's genius; though in no one
of the four is any one of his masterly qualities absent. There is
tenderness even in _Jonathan Wild_; there are touches in _Joseph
Andrews_ of that irony of the Preacher, the last echo of which is heard
amid the kindly resignation of the _Journey to Lisbon_, in the sentence,
"Whereas envy of all things most exposes us to danger from others, so
contempt of all things best secures us from them." But on the whole it
is safe to say that _Joseph Andrews_ best presents Fielding's
mischievous and playful wit; _Jonathan Wild_ his half-Lucianic
half-Swiftian irony; _Tom Jones_ his unerring knowledge of human nature,
and his constructive faculty; _Amelia_ his tenderness, his _mitis
sapientia_, his observation of the details of life. And first of
the first.

_The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews and his friend Mr
Abraham Adams_ was, as has been said above, published in February 1742.
A facsimile of the agreement between author and publisher will be given
in the second volume of this series; and it is not uninteresting to
observe that the witness, William Young, is none other than the asserted
original of the immortal Mr Adams himself. He might, on Balzac's plea in
a tolerably well-known anecdote, have demanded half of the L183, 11s. Of
the other origins of the book we have a pretty full account, partly
documentary. That it is "writ in the manner of Cervantes," and is
intended as a kind of comic epic, is the author's own statement--no
doubt as near the actual truth as is consistent with comic-epic theory.
That there are resemblances to Scarron, to Le Sage, and to other
practitioners of the Picaresque novel is certain; and it was inevitable
that there should be. Of directer and more immediate models or
starting-points one is undoubted; the other, though less generally
admitted, not much less indubitable to my mind. The parody of
Richardson's _Pamela_, which was little more than a year earlier (Nov.
1740), is avowed, open, flagrant; nor do I think that the author was so
soon carried away by the greater and larger tide of his own invention as
some critics seem to hold. He is always more or less returning to the
ironic charge; and the multiplicity of the assailants of Joseph's virtue
only disguises the resemblance to the long-drawn dangers of Pamela from
a single ravisher. But Fielding was also well acquainted with Marivaux's
_Paysan Parvenu_, and the resemblances between that book and _Joseph
Andrews_ are much stronger than Fielding's admirers have always been
willing to admit. This recalcitrance has, I think, been mainly due to
the erroneous conception of Marivaux as, if not a mere fribble, yet a
Dresden-Shepherdess kind of writer, good at "preciousness" and
patch-and-powder manners, but nothing more.

There was, in fact, a very strong satiric and ironic touch in the author
of _Marianne_, and I do not think that I was too rash when some years
ago I ventured to speak of him as "playing Fielding to his own
Richardson" in the _Paysan Parvenu_.

Origins, however, and indebtedness and the like, are, when great work is
concerned, questions for the study and the lecture-room, for the
literary historian and the professional critic, rather than for the
reader, however intelligent and alert, who wishes to enjoy a
masterpiece, and is content simply to enjoy it. It does not really
matter how close to anything else something which possesses independent
goodness is; the very utmost technical originality, the most spotless
purity from the faintest taint of suggestion, will not suffice to confer
merit on what does not otherwise possess it. Whether, as I rather think,
Fielding pursued the plan he had formed _ab incepto_, or whether he
cavalierly neglected it, or whether the current of his own genius
carried him off his legs and landed him, half against his will, on the
shore of originality, are questions for the Schools, and, as I venture
to think, not for the higher forms in them. We have _Joseph Andrews_ as
it is; and we may be abundantly thankful for it. The contents of it, as
of all Fielding's work in this kind, include certain things for which
the moderns are scantly grateful. Of late years, and not of late years
only, there has grown up a singular and perhaps an ignorant impatience
of digressions, of episodes, of tales within a tale. The example of this
which has been most maltreated is the "Man of the Hill" episode in _Tom
Jones_; but the stories of the "Unfortunate Jilt" and of Mr Wilson in
our present subject, do not appear to me to be much less obnoxious to
the censure; and _Amelia_ contains more than one or two things of the
same kind. Me they do not greatly disturb; and I see many defences for
them besides the obvious, and at a pinch sufficient one, that
divagations of this kind existed in all Fielding's Spanish and French
models, that the public of the day expected them, and so forth. This
defence is enough, but it is easy to amplify and reintrench it. It is
not by any means the fact that the Picaresque novel of adventure is the
only or the chief form of fiction which prescribes or admits these
episodic excursions. All the classical epics have them; many eastern and
other stories present them; they are common, if not invariable, in the
abundant mediaeval literature of prose and verse romance; they are not
unknown by any means in the modern novel; and you will very rarely hear
a story told orally at the dinner-table or in the smoking-room without
something of the kind. There must, therefore, be something in them
corresponding to an inseparable accident of that most unchanging of all
things, human nature. And I do not think the special form with which we
are here concerned by any means the worst that they have taken. It has
the grand and prominent virtue of being at once and easily skippable.
There is about Cervantes and Le Sage, about Fielding and Smollett, none
of the treachery of the modern novelist, who induces the conscientious
reader to drag through pages, chapters, and sometimes volumes which have
nothing to do with the action, for fear he should miss something that
has to do with it. These great men have a fearless frankness, and almost
tell you in so many words when and what you may skip. Therefore, if the
"Curious Impertinent," and the "Baneful Marriage," and the "Man of the
Hill," and the "Lady of Quality," get in the way, when you desire to
"read for the story," you have nothing to do but turn the page till
_finis_ comes. The defence has already been made by an illustrious hand
for Fielding's inter-chapters and exordiums. It appears to me to be
almost more applicable to his insertions.

And so we need not trouble ourselves any more either about the
insertions or about the exordiums. They both please me; the second class
has pleased persons much better worth pleasing than I can pretend to be;
but the making or marring of the book lies elsewhere. I do not think
that it lies in the construction, though Fielding's following of the
ancients, both sincere and satiric, has imposed a false air of
regularity upon that. The Odyssey of Joseph, of Fanny, and of their
ghostly mentor and bodily guard is, in truth, a little haphazard, and
might have been longer or shorter without any discreet man approving it
the more or the less therefor. The real merits lie partly in the
abounding humour and satire of the artist's criticism, but even more in
the marvellous vivacity and fertility of his creation. For the very
first time in English prose fiction every character is alive, every
incident is capable of having happened. There are lively touches in the
Elizabethan romances; but they are buried in verbiage, swathed in stage
costume, choked and fettered by their authors' want of art. The quality
of Bunyan's knowledge of men was not much inferior to Shakespeare's, or
at least to Fielding's; but the range and the results of it were cramped
by his single theological purpose, and his unvaried allegoric or typical
form. Why Defoe did not discover the New World of Fiction, I at least
have never been able to put into any brief critical formula that
satisfies me, and I have never seen it put by any one else. He had not
only seen it afar off, he had made landings and descents on it; he had
carried off and exhibited in triumph natives such as Robinson Crusoe,
as Man Friday, as Moll Flanders, as William the Quaker; but he had
conquered, subdued, and settled no province therein. I like _Pamela_; I
like it better than some persons who admire Richardson on the whole more
than I do, seem to like it. But, as in all its author's work, the
handling seems to me academic--the working out on paper of an
ingeniously conceived problem rather than the observation or evolution
of actual or possible life. I should not greatly fear to push the
comparison even into foreign countries; but it is well to observe
limits. Let us be content with holding that in England at least, without
prejudice to anything further, Fielding was the first to display the
qualities of the perfect novelist as distinguished from the romancer.

What are those qualities, as shown in _Joseph Andrews_? The faculty of
arranging a probable and interesting course of action is one, of course,
and Fielding showed it here. But I do not think that it is at any time
the greatest one; and nobody denies that he made great advances in this
direction later. The faculty of lively dialogue is another; and that he
has not often been refused; but much the same may be said of it. The
interspersing of appropriate description is another; but here also we
shall not find him exactly a paragon. It is in character--the chief
_differentia_ of the novel as distinguished not merely from its elder
sister the romance, and its cousin the drama, but still more from every
other kind of literature--that Fielding stands even here pre-eminent. No
one that I can think of, except his greatest successor in the present
century, has the same unfailing gift of breathing life into every
character he creates or borrows; and even Thackeray draws, if I may use
the phrase, his characters more in the flat and less in the round than
Fielding. Whether in Blifil he once failed, we must discuss hereafter;
he has failed nowhere in _Joseph Andrews_. Some of his sketches may
require the caution that they are eighteenth-century men and women; some
the warning that they are obviously caricatured, or set in designed
profile, or merely sketched. But they are all alive. The finical
estimate of Gray (it is a horrid joy to think how perfectly capable
Fielding was of having joined in that practical joke of the young
gentlemen of Cambridge, which made Gray change his college), while
dismissing these light things with patronage, had to admit that "parson
Adams is perfectly well, so is Mrs Slipslop." "They _were_, Mr
Gray," said some one once, "they were more perfectly well, and in a
higher kind, than anything you ever did; though you were a pretty
workman too."

Yes, parson Adams is perfectly well, and so is Mrs Slipslop. But so are
they all. Even the hero and heroine, tied and bound as they are by the
necessity under which their maker lay of preserving Joseph's
Joseph-hood, and of making Fanny the example of a franker and less
interested virtue than her sister-in-law that might have been, are
surprisingly human where most writers would have made them sticks. And
the rest require no allowance. Lady Booby, few as are the strokes given
to her, is not much less alive than Lady Bellaston. Mr Trulliber,
monster and not at all delicate monster as he is, is also a man, and
when he lays it down that no one even in his own house shall drink when
he "caaled vurst," one can but pay his maker the tribute of that silent
shudder of admiration which hails the addition of one more everlasting
entity to the world of thought and fancy. And Mr Tow-wouse is real, and
Mrs Tow-wouse is more real still, and Betty is real; and the coachman,
and Miss Grave-airs, and all the wonderful crew from first to last. The
dresses they wear, the manners they exhibit, the laws they live under,
the very foods and drinks they live upon, are "past like the shadows on
glasses"--to the comfort and rejoicing of some, to the greater or less
sorrow of others. But _they_ are there--alive, full of blood, full of
breath as we are, and, in truth, I fear a little more so. For some
purposes a century is a gap harder to cross and more estranging than a
couple of millenniums. But in their case the gap is nothing; and it is
not too much to say that as they have stood the harder test, they will
stand the easier. There are very striking differences between Nausicaa
and Mrs Slipslop; there are differences not less striking between Mrs
Slipslop and Beatrice. But their likeness is a stranger and more
wonderful thing than any of their unlikenesses. It is that they are
all women, that they are all live citizenesses of the Land of Matters
Unforgot, the fashion whereof passeth not away, and the franchise
whereof, once acquired, assures immortality.



NOTE TO GENERAL INTRODUCTION.


_The text of this issue in the main follows that of the standard or
first collected edition of 1762. The variants which the author
introduced in successive editions during his lifetime are not
inconsiderable; but for the purposes of the present issue it did not
seem necessary or indeed desirable to take account of them. In the case
of prose fiction, more than in any other department of literature, it is
desirable that work should be read in the form which represents the
completest intention and execution of the author. Nor have any notes
been attempted; for again such things, in the case of prose fiction, are
of very doubtful use, and supply pretty certain stumbling-blocks to
enjoyment; while in the particular case of Fielding, the annotation,
unless extremely capricious, would have to be disgustingly full. Far be
it at any rate from the present editor to bury these delightful
creations under an ugly crust of parallel passages and miscellaneous
erudition. The sheets, however, have been carefully read in order to
prevent the casual errors which are wont to creep into frequently
reprinted texts; and the editor hopes that if any such have escaped him,
the escape will not be attributed to wilful negligence. A few obvious
errors, in spelling of proper names, &c., which occur in the 1762
version have been corrected: but wherever the readings of that version
are possible they have been preferred. The embellishments of the edition
are partly fanciful and partly "documentary;" so that it is hoped both
classes of taste may have something to feed upon._




AUTHOR'S PREFACE.


As it is possible the mere English reader may have a different idea of
romance from the author of these little[A] volumes, and may consequently
expect a kind of entertainment not to be found, nor which was even
intended, in the following pages, it may not be improper to premise a
few words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to
have seen hitherto attempted in our language.

[A] _Joseph Andrews_ was originally published in 2 vols. duodecimo.

The EPIC, as well as the DRAMA, is divided into tragedy and comedy.
HOMER, who was the father of this species of poetry, gave us a pattern
of both these, though that of the latter kind is entirely lost; which
Aristotle tells us, bore the same relation to comedy which his Iliad
bears to tragedy. And perhaps, that we have no more instances of it
among the writers of antiquity, is owing to the loss of this great
pattern, which, had it survived, would have found its imitators equally
with the other poems of this great original.

And farther, as this poetry may be tragic or comic, I will not scruple
to say it may be likewise either in verse or prose: for though it wants
one particular, which the critic enumerates in the constituent parts of
an epic poem, namely metre; yet, when any kind of writing contains all
its other parts, such as fable, action, characters, sentiments, and
diction, and is deficient in metre only, it seems, I think, reasonable
to refer it to the epic; at least, as no critic hath thought proper to
range it under any other head, or to assign it a particular name
to itself.

Thus the Telemachus of the archbishop of Cambray appears to me of the
epic kind, as well as the Odyssey of Homer; indeed, it is much fairer
and more reasonable to give it a name common with that species from
which it differs only in a single instance, than to confound it with
those which it resembles in no other. Such are those voluminous works,
commonly called Romances, namely, Clelia, Cleopatra, Astraea, Cassandra,
the Grand Cyrus, and innumerable others, which contain, as I apprehend,
very little instruction or entertainment.

Now, a comic romance is a comic epic poem in prose; differing from
comedy, as the serious epic from tragedy: its action being more extended
and comprehensive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and
introducing a greater variety of characters. It differs from the serious
roma(says he, taking the gentleman by the hand), "I
am heartily glad to meet with a man of your kidney; for, though I am a
poor parson, I will be bold to say I am an honest man, and would not do
an ill thing to be made a bishop; nay, though it hath not fallen in my
way to offer so noble a sacrifice, I have not been without opportunities
of suffering for the sake of my conscience, I thank Heaven for them; for
I have had relations, though I say it, who made some figure in the
world; particularly a nephew, who was a shopkeeper and an alderman of a
corporation. He was a good lad, and was under my care when a boy; and I
believe would do what I bade him to his dying day. Indeed, it looks like
extreme vanity in me to affect being a man of such consequence as to
have so great an interest in an alderman; but others have thought so
too, as manifestly appeared by the rector, whose curate I formerly was,
sending for me on the approach of an election, and telling me, if I
expected to continue in his cure, that I must bring my nephew to vote
for one Colonel Courtly, a gentleman whom I had never heard tidings of
till that instant. I told the rector I had no power over my nephew's
vote (God forgive me for such prevarication!); that I supposed he would
give it according to his conscience; that I would by no means endeavour
to influence him to give it otherwise. He told me it was in vain to
equivocate; that he knew I had already spoke to him in favour of esquire
Fickle, my neighbour; and, indeed, it was true I had; for it was at a
season when the church was in danger, and when all good men expected
they knew not what would happen to us all. I then answered boldly, if he
thought I had given my promise, he affronted me in proposing any breach
of it. Not to be too prolix; I persevered, and so did my nephew, in the
esquire's interest, who was chose chiefly through his means; and so I
lost my curacy, Well, sir, but do you think the esquire ever mentioned a
word of the church? _Ne verbum quidem, ut ita dicam_: within two years
he got a place, and hath ever since lived in London; where I have been
informed (but God forbid I should believe that,) that he never so much
as goeth to church. I remained, sir, a considerable time without any
cure, and lived a full month on one funeral sermon, which I preached on
the indisposition of a clergyman; but this by the bye. At last, when Mr
Fickle got his place, Colonel Courtly stood again; and who should make
interest for him but Mr Fickle himself! that very identical Mr Fickle,
who had formerly told me the colonel was an enemy to both the church and
state, had the confidence to sollicit my nephew for him; and the colonel
himself offered me to make me chaplain to his regiment, which I refused
in favour of Sir Oliver Hearty, who told us he would sacrifice
everything to his country; and I believe he would, except his hunting,
which he stuck so close to, that in five years together he went but
twice up to parliament; and one of those times, I have been told, never
was within sight of the House. However, he was a worthy man, and the
best friend I ever had; for, by his interest with a bishop, he got me
replaced into my curacy, and gave me eight pounds out of his own pocket
to buy me a gown and cassock, and furnish my house. He had our interest
while he lived, which was not many years. On his death I had fresh
applications made to me; for all the world knew the interest I had with
my good nephew, who now was a leading man in the corporation; and Sir
Thomas Booby, buying the estate which had been Sir Oliver's, proposed
himself a candidate. He was then a young gentleman just come from his
travels; and it did me good to hear him discourse on affairs which, for
my part, I knew nothing of. If I had been master of a thousand votes he
should have had them all. I engaged my nephew in his interest, and he
was elected; and a very fine parliament-man he was. They tell me he made
speeches of an hour long, and, I have been told, very fine ones; but he
could never persuade the parliament to be of his opinion. _Non omnia
possumus omnes_. He promised me a living, poor man! and I believe I
should have had it, but an accident happened, which was, that my lady
had promised it before, unknown to him. This, indeed, I never heard till
afterwards; for my nephew, who died about a month before the incumbent,
always told me I might be assured of it. Since that time, Sir Thomas,
poor man, had always so much business, that he never could find leisure
to see me. I believe it was partly my lady's fault too, who did not
think my dress good enough for the gentry at her table. However, I must
do him the justice to say he never was ungrateful; and I have always
found his kitchen, and his cellar too, open to me: many a time, after
service on a Sunday--for I preach at four churches--have I recruited my
spirits with a glass of his ale. Since my nephew's death, the
corporation is in other hands; and I am not a man of that consequence I
was formerly. I have now no longer any talents to lay out in the service
of my country; and to whom nothing is given, of him can nothing be
required. However, on all proper seasons, such as the approach of an
election, I throw a suitable dash or two into my sermons; which I have
the pleasure to hear is not disagreeable to Sir Thomas and the other
honest gentlemen my neighbours, who have all promised me these five
years to procure an ordination for a son of mine, who is now near
thirty, hath an infinite stock of learning, and is, I thank Heaven, of
an unexceptionable life; though, as he was never at an university, the
bishop refuses to ordain him. Too much care cannot indeed be taken in
admitting any to the sacred office; though I hope he will never act so
as to be a disgrace to any order, but will serve his God and his country
to the utmost of his power, as I have endeavoured to do before him; nay,
and will lay down his life whenever called to that purpose. I am sure I
have educated him in those principles; so that I have acquitted my duty,
and shall have nothing to answer for on that account. But I do not
distrust him, for he is a good boy; and if Providence should throw it in
his way to be of as much consequence in a public light as his father
once was, I can answer for him he will use his talents as honestly as I
have done."



CHAPTER IX.

_In which the gentleman discants on bravery and heroic virtue, till an
unlucky accident puts an end to the discourse._


The gentleman highly commended Mr Adams for his good resolutions, and
told him, "He hoped his son would tread in his steps;" adding, "that if
he would not die for his country, he would not be worthy to live in it.
I'd make no more of shooting a man that would not die for his
country, than--

"Sir," said he, "I have disinherited a nephew, who is in the army,
because he would not exchange his commission and go to the West Indies.
I believe the rascal is a coward, though he pretends to be in love
forsooth. I would have all such fellows hanged, sir; I would have them
hanged." Adams answered, "That would be too severe; that men did not
make themselves; and if fear had too much ascendance in the mind, the
man was rather to be pitied than abhorred; that reason and time might
teach him to subdue it." He said, "A man might be a coward at one time,
and brave at another. Homer," says he, "who so well understood and
copied Nature, hath taught us this lesson; for Paris fights and Hector
runs away. Nay, we have a mighty instance of this in the history of
later ages, no longer ago than the 705th year of Rome, when the great
Pompey, who had won so many battles and been honoured with so many
triumphs, and of whose valour several authors, especially Cicero and
Paterculus, have formed such elogiums; this very Pompey left the battle
of Pharsalia before he had lost it, and retreated to his tent, where he
sat like the most pusillanimous rascal in a fit of despair, and yielded
a victory, which was to determine the empire of the world, to Caesar. I
am not much travelled in the history of modern times, that is to say,
these last thousand years; but those who are can, I make no question,
furnish you with parallel instances." He concluded, therefore, that, had
he taken any such hasty resolutions against his nephew, he hoped he
would consider better, and retract them. The gentleman answered with
great warmth, and talked much of courage and his country, till,
perceiving it grew late, he asked Adams, "What place he intended for
that night?" He told him, "He waited there for the stage-coach."--"The
stage-coach, sir!" said the gentleman; "they are all passed by long ago.
You may see the last yourself almost three miles before us."--"I protest
and so they are," cries Adams; "then I must make haste and follow them."
The gentleman told him, "he would hardly be able to overtake them; and
that, if he did not know his way, he would be in danger of losing
himself on the downs, for it would be presently dark; and he might
ramble about all night, and perhaps find himself farther from his
journey's end in the morning than he was now." He advised him,
therefore, "to accompany him to his house, which was very little out of
his way," assuring him "that he would find some country fellow in his
parish who would conduct him for sixpence to the city where he was
going." Adams accepted this proposal, and on they travelled, the
gentleman renewing his discourse on courage, and the infamy of not being
ready, at all times, to sacrifice our lives to our country. Night
overtook them much about the same time as they arrived near some bushes;
whence, on a sudden, they heard the most violent shrieks imaginable in a
female voice. Adams offered to snatch the gun out of his companion's
hand. "What are you doing?" said he. "Doing!" said Adams; "I am
hastening to the assistance of the poor creature whom some villains are
murdering." "You are not mad enough, I hope," says the gentleman,
trembling: "do you consider this gun is only charged with shot, and that
the robbers are most probably furnished with pistols loaded with
bullets? This is no business of ours; let us make as much haste as
possible out of the way, or we may fall into their hands ourselves." The
shrieks now increasing, Adams made no answer, but snapt his fingers,
and, brandishing his crabstick, made directly to the place whence the
voice issued; and the man of courage made as much expedition towards his
own home, whither he escaped in a very short time without once looking
behind him; where we will leave him, to contemplate his own bravery, and
to censure the want of it in others, and return to the good Adams, who,
on coming up to the place whence the noise proceeded, found a woman
struggling with a man, who had thrown her on the ground, and had almost
overpowered her. The great abilities of Mr Adams were not necessary to
have formed a right judgment of this affair on the first sight. He did
not, therefore, want the entreaties of the poor wretch to assist her;
but, lifting up his crabstick, he immediately levelled a blow at that
part of the ravisher's head where, according to the opinion of the
ancients, the brains of some persons are deposited, and which he had
undoubtedly let forth, had not Nature (who, as wise men have observed,
equips all creatures with what is most expedient for them) taken a
provident care (as she always doth with those she intends for
encounters) to make this part of the head three times as thick as those
of ordinary men who are designed to exercise talents which are vulgarly
called rational, and for whom, as brains are necessary, she is obliged
to leave some room for them in the cavity of the skull; whereas, those
ingredients being entirely useless to persons of the heroic calling, she
hath an opportunity of thickening the bone, so as to make it less
subject to any impression, or liable to be cracked or broken: and
indeed, in some who are predestined to the command of armies and
empires, she is supposed sometimes to make that part perfectly solid.

As a game cock, when engaged in amorous toying with a hen, if perchance
he espies another cock at hand, immediately quits his female, and
opposes himself to his rival, so did the ravisher, on the information of
the crabstick, immediately leap from the woman and hasten to assail the
man. He had no weapons but what Nature had furnished him with. However,
he clenched his fist, and presently darted it at that part of Adams's
breast where the heart is lodged. Adams staggered at the violence of the
blow, when, throwing away his staff, he likewise clenched that fist
which we have before commemorated, and would have discharged it full in
the breast of his antagonist, had he not dexterously caught it with his
left hand, at the same time darting his head (which some modern heroes
of the lower class use, like the battering-ram of the ancients, for a
weapon of offence; another reason to admire the cunningness of Nature,
in composing it of those impenetrable materials); dashing his head, I
say, into the stomach of Adams, he tumbled him on his back; and, not
having any regard to the laws of heroism, which would have restrained
him from any farther attack on his enemy till he was again on his legs,
he threw himself upon him, and, laying hold on the ground with his left
hand, he with his right belaboured the body of Adams till he was weary,
and indeed till he concluded (to use the language of fighting) "that he
had done his business;" or, in the language of poetry, "that he had sent
him to the shades below;" in plain English, "that he was dead."

But Adams, who was no chicken, and could bear a drubbing as well as any
boxing champion in the universe, lay still only to watch his
opportunity; and now, perceiving his antagonist to pant with his
labours, he exerted his utmost force at once, and with such success that
he overturned him, and became his superior; when, fixing one of his
knees in his breast, he cried out in an exulting voice, "It is my turn
now;" and, after a few minutes' constant application, he gave him so
dexterous a blow just under his chin that the fellow no longer retained
any motion, and Adams began to fear he had struck him once too often;
for he often asserted "he should be concerned to have the blood of even
the wicked upon him."

Adams got up and called aloud to the young woman. "Be of good cheer,
damsel," said he, "you are no longer in danger of your ravisher, who, I
am terribly afraid, lies dead at my feet; but God forgive me what I have
done in defence of innocence!" The poor wretch, who had been some time
in recovering strength enough to rise, and had afterwards, during the
engagement, stood trembling, being disabled by fear even from running
away, hearing her champion was victorious, came up to him, but not
without apprehensions even of her deliverer; which, however, she was
soon relieved from by his courteous behaviour and gentle words. They
were both standing by the body, which lay motionless on the ground, and
which Adams wished to see stir much more than the woman did, when he
earnestly begged her to tell him "by what misfortune she came, at such a
time of night, into so lonely a place." She acquainted him, "She was
travelling towards London, and had accidentally met with the person from
whom he had delivered her, who told her he was likewise on his journey
to the same place, and would keep her company; an offer which,
suspecting no harm, she had accepted; that he told her they were at a
small distance from an inn where she might take up her lodging that
evening, and he would show her a nearer way to it than by following the
road; that if she had suspected him (which she did not, he spoke so
kindly to her), being alone on these downs in the dark, she had no human
means to avoid him; that, therefore, she put her whole trust in
Providence, and walked on, expecting every moment to arrive at the inn;
when on a sudden, being come to those bushes, he desired her to stop,
and after some rude kisses, which she resisted, and some entreaties,
which she rejected, he laid violent hands on her, and was attempting to
execute his wicked will, when, she thanked G--, he timely came up and
prevented him." Adams encouraged her for saying she had put her whole
trust in Providence, and told her, "He doubted not but Providence had
sent him to her deliverance, as a reward for that trust. He wished
indeed he had not deprived the wicked wretch of life, but G--'s will be
done;" said, "He hoped the goodness of his intention would excuse him in
the next world, and he trusted in her evidence to acquit him in this."
He was then silent, and began to consider with himself whether it would
be properer to make his escape, or to deliver himself into the hands of
justice; which meditation ended as the reader will see in the
next chapter.



CHAPTER X.

_Giving an account of the strange catastrophe of the preceding
adventure, which drew poor Adams into fresh calamities; and who the
woman was who owed the preservation of her chastity to his
victorious arm._


The silence of Adams, added to the darkness of the night and loneliness
of the place, struck dreadful apprehension into the poor woman's mind;
she began to fear as great an enemy in her deliverer as he had
delivered her from; and as she had not light enough to discover the age
of Adams, and the benevolence visible in his countenance, she suspected
he had used her as some very honest men have used their country; and had
rescued her out of the hands of one rifler in order to rifle her
himself. Such were the suspicions she drew from his silence; but indeed
they were ill-grounded. He stood over his vanquished enemy, wisely
weighing in his mind the objections which might be made to either of the
two methods of proceeding mentioned in the last chapter, his judgment
sometimes inclining to the one, and sometimes to the other; for both
seemed to him so equally advisable and so equally dangerous, that
probably he would have ended his days, at least two or three of them, on
that very spot, before he had taken any resolution; at length he lifted
up his eyes, and spied a light at a distance, to which he instantly
addressed himself with _Heus tu, traveller, heus tu!_ He presently heard
several voices, and perceived the light approaching toward him. The
persons who attended the light began some to laugh, others to sing, and
others to hollow, at which the woman testified some fear (for she had
concealed her suspicions of the parson himself); but Adams said, "Be of
good cheer, damsel, and repose thy trust in the same Providence which
hath hitherto protected thee, and never will forsake the innocent."
These people, who now approached, were no other, reader, than a set of
young fellows, who came to these bushes in pursuit of a diversion which
they call bird-batting. This, if you are ignorant of it (as perhaps if
thou hast never travelled beyond Kensington, Islington, Hackney, or the
Borough, thou mayst be), I will inform thee, is performed by holding a
large clap-net before a lanthorn, and at the same time beating the
bushes; for the birds, when they are disturbed from their places of
rest, or roost, immediately make to the light, and so are inticed
within the net. Adams immediately told them what happened, and desired
them to hold the lanthorn to the face of the man on the ground, for he
feared he had smote him fatally. But indeed his fears were frivolous;
for the fellow, though he had been stunned by the last blow he received,
had long since recovered his senses, and, finding himself quit of Adams,
had listened attentively to the discourse between him and the young
woman; for whose departure he had patiently waited, that he might
likewise withdraw himself, having no longer hopes of succeeding in his
desires, which were moreover almost as well cooled by Mr Adams as they
could have been by the young woman herself had he obtained his utmost
wish. This fellow, who had a readiness at improving any accident,
thought he might now play a better part than that of a dead man; and,
accordingly, the moment the candle was held to his face he leapt up,
and, laying hold on Adams, cried out, "No, villain, I am not dead,
though you and your wicked whore might well think me so, after the
barbarous cruelties you have exercised on me. Gentlemen," said he, "you
are luckily come to the assistance of a poor traveller, who would
otherwise have been robbed and murdered by this vile man and woman, who
led me hither out of my way from the high-road, and both falling on me
have used me as you see." Adams was going to answer, when one of the
young fellows cried, "D--n them, let's carry them both before the
justice." The poor woman began to tremble, and Adams lifted up his
voice, but in vain. Three or four of them laid hands on him; and one
holding the lanthorn to his face, they all agreed he had the most
villainous countenance they ever beheld; and an attorney's clerk, who
was of the company, declared he was sure he had remembered him at the
bar. As to the woman, her hair was dishevelled in the struggle, and her
nose had bled; so that they could not perceive whether she was handsome
or ugly, but they said her fright plainly discovered her guilt. And
searching her pockets, as they did those of Adams, for money, which the
fellow said he had lost, they found in her pocket a purse with some gold
in it, which abundantly convinced them, especially as the fellow offered
to swear to it. Mr Adams was found to have no more than one halfpenny
about him. This the clerk said "was a great presumption that he was an
old offender, by cunningly giving all the booty to the woman." To which
all the rest readily assented.

This accident promising them better sport than what they had proposed,
they quitted their intention of catching birds, and unanimously resolved
to proceed to the justice with the offenders. Being informed what a
desperate fellow Adams was, they tied his hands behind him; and, having
hid their nets among the bushes, and the lanthorn being carried before
them, they placed the two prisoners in their front, and then began their
march; Adams not only submitting patiently to his own fate, but
comforting and encouraging his companion under her sufferings.

Whilst they were on their way the clerk informed the rest that this
adventure would prove a very beneficial one; for that they would all be
entitled to their proportions of £80 for apprehending the robbers. This
occasioned a contention concerning the parts which they had severally
borne in taking them; one insisting he ought to have the greatest share,
for he had first laid his hands on Adams; another claiming a superior
part for having first held the lanthorn to the man's face on the ground,
by which, he said, "the whole was discovered." The clerk claimed
four-fifths of the reward for having proposed to search the prisoners,
and likewise the carrying them before the justice: he said, "Indeed, in
strict justice, he ought to have the whole." These claims, however,
they at last consented to refer to a future decision, but seemed all to
agree that the clerk was entitled to a moiety. They then debated what
money should be allotted to the young fellow who had been employed only
in holding the nets. He very modestly said, "That he did not apprehend
any large proportion would fall to his share, but hoped they would allow
him something; he desired them to consider that they had assigned their
nets to his care, which prevented him from being as forward as any in
laying hold of the robbers" (for so those innocent people were called);
"that if he had not occupied the nets, some other must;" concluding,
however, "that he should be contented with the smallest share
imaginable, and should think that rather their bounty than his merit."
But they were all unanimous in excluding him from any part whatever, the
clerk particularly swearing, "If they gave him a shilling they might do
what they pleased with the rest; for he would not concern himself with
the affair." This contention was so hot, and so totally engaged the
attention of all the parties, that a dexterous nimble thief, had he been
in Mr Adams's situation, would have taken care to have given the justice
no trouble that evening. Indeed, it required not the art of a Sheppard
to escape, especially as the darkness of the night would have so much
befriended him; but Adams trusted rather to his innocence than his
heels, and, without thinking of flight, which was easy, or resistance
(which was impossible, as there were six lusty young fellows, besides
the villain himself, present), he walked with perfect resignation the
way they thought proper to conduct him.

Adams frequently vented himself in ejaculations during their journey; at
last, poor Joseph Andrews occurring to his mind, he could not refrain
sighing forth his name, which being heard by his companion in
affliction, she cried with some vehemence, "Sure I should know that
voice; you cannot certainly, sir, be Mr Abraham Adams?"--"Indeed,
damsel," says he, "that is my name; there is something also in your
voice which persuades me I have heard it before."--"La! sir," says she,
"don't you remember poor Fanny?"--"How, Fanny!" answered Adams: "indeed
I very well remember you; what can have brought you hither?"--"I have
told you, sir," replied she, "I was travelling towards London; but I
thought you mentioned Joseph Andrews; pray what is become of him?"--"I
left him, child, this afternoon," said Adams, "in the stage-coach, in
his way towards our parish, whither he is going to see you."--"To see
me! La, sir," answered Fanny, "sure you jeer me; what should he be going
to see me for?"--"Can you ask that?" replied Adams. "I hope, Fanny, you
are not inconstant; I assure you he deserves much better of you."--"La!
Mr Adams," said she, "what is Mr Joseph to me? I am sure I never had
anything to say to him, but as one fellow-servant might to another."--"I
am sorry to hear this," said Adams; "a virtuous passion for a young man
is what no woman need be ashamed of. You either do not tell me truth, or
you are false to a very worthy man." Adams then told her what had
happened at the inn, to which she listened very attentively; and a sigh
often escaped from her, notwithstanding her utmost endeavours to the
contrary; nor could she prevent herself from asking a thousand
questions, which would have assured any one but Adams, who never saw
farther into people than they desired to let him, of the truth of a
passion she endeavoured to conceal. Indeed, the fact was, that this poor
girl, having heard of Joseph's misfortune, by some of the servants
belonging to the coach which we have formerly mentioned to have stopt at
the inn while the poor youth was confined to his bed, that instant
abandoned the cow she was milking, and, taking with her a little bundle
of clothes under her arm, and all the money she was worth in her own
purse, without consulting any one, immediately set forward in pursuit of
one whom, notwithstanding her shyness to the parson, she loved with
inexpressible violence, though with the purest and most delicate
passion. This shyness, therefore, as we trust it will recommend her
character to all our female readers, and not greatly surprize such of
our males as are well acquainted with the younger part of the other sex,
we shall not give ourselves any trouble to vindicate.



CHAPTER XI.

_What happened to them while before the justice. A chapter very full of
learning._


Their fellow-travellers were so engaged in the hot dispute concerning
the division of the reward for apprehending these innocent people, that
they attended very little to their discourse. They were now arrived at
the justice's house, and had sent one of his servants in to acquaint his
worship that they had taken two robbers and brought them before him. The
justice, who was just returned from a fox-chase, and had not yet
finished his dinner, ordered them to carry the prisoners into the
stable, whither they were attended by all the servants in the house, and
all the people in the neighbourhood, who flocked together to see them
with as much curiosity as if there was something uncommon to be seen, or
that a rogue did not look like other people.

The justice, now being in the height of his mirth and his cups,
bethought himself of the prisoners; and, telling his company he believed
they should have good sport in their examination, he ordered them into
his presence. They had no sooner entered the room than he began to
revile them, saying, "That robberies on the highway were now grown so
frequent, that people could not sleep safely in their beds, and assured
them they both should be made examples of at the ensuing assizes." After
he had gone on some time in this manner, he was reminded by his clerk,
"That it would be proper to take the depositions of the witnesses
against them." Which he bid him do, and he would light his pipe in the
meantime. Whilst the clerk was employed in writing down the deposition
of the fellow who had pretended to be robbed, the justice employed
himself in cracking jests on poor Fanny, in which he was seconded by all
the company at table. One asked, "Whether she was to be indicted for a
highwayman?" Another whispered in her ear, "If she had not provided
herself a great belly, he was at her service." A third said, "He
warranted she was a relation of Turpin." To which one of the company, a
great wit, shaking his head, and then his sides, answered, "He believed
she was nearer related to Turpis;" at which there was an universal
laugh. They were proceeding thus with the poor girl, when somebody,
smoking the cassock peeping forth from under the greatcoat of Adams,
cried out, "What have we here, a parson?" "How, sirrah," says the
justice, "do you go robbing in the dress of a clergyman? let me tell you
your habit will not entitle you to the benefit of the clergy." "Yes,"
said the witty fellow, "he will have one benefit of clergy, he will be
exalted above the heads of the people;" at which there was a second
laugh. And now the witty spark, seeing his jokes take, began to rise in
spirits; and, turning to Adams, challenged him to cap verses, and,
provoking him by giving the first blow, he repeated--

    _"Molle meum levibus cord est vilebile telis."_

Upon which Adams, with a look full of ineffable contempt, told him, "He
deserved scourging for his pronunciation." The witty fellow answered,
"What do you deserve, doctor, for not being able to answer the first
time? Why, I'll give one, you blockhead, with an S.

    _"'Si licet, ut fulvum spectatur in ignibus haurum.'_

"What, canst not with an M neither? Thou art a pretty fellow for a
parson! Why didst not steal some of the parson's Latin as well as his
gown?" Another at the table then answered, "If he had, you would have
been too hard for him; I remember you at the college a very devil at
this sport; I have seen you catch a freshman, for nobody that knew you
would engage with you." "I have forgot those things now," cried the wit.
"I believe I could have done pretty well formerly. Let's see, what did I
end with?--an M again--aye--

    _"'Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, virorum.'_

I could have done it once." "Ah! evil betide you, and so you can now,"
said the other: "nobody in this country will undertake you." Adams could
hold no longer: "Friend," said he, "I have a boy not above eight years
old who would instruct thee that the last verse runs thus:--

    _"'Ut sunt Divorum, Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, virorum.'"_

"I'll hold thee a guinea of that," said the wit, throwing the money on
the table. "And I'll go your halves," cries the other. "Done," answered
Adams; but upon applying to his pocket he was forced to retract, and own
he had no money about him; which set them all a-laughing, and confirmed
the triumph of his adversary, which was not moderate, any more than the
approbation he met with from the whole company, who told Adams he must
go a little longer to school before he attempted to attack that
gentleman in Latin.

The clerk, having finished the depositions, as well of the fellow
himself, as of those who apprehended the prisoners, delivered them to
the justice; who, having sworn the several witnesses without reading a
syllable, ordered his clerk to make the mittimus.

Adams then said, "He hoped he should not be condemned unheard." "No,
no," cries the justice, "you will be asked what you have to say for
yourself when you come on your trial: we are not trying you now; I shall
only commit you to gaol: if you can prove your innocence at size, you
will be found ignoramus, and so no harm done." "Is it no punishment,
sir, for an innocent man to lie several months in gaol?" cries Adams: "I
beg you would at least hear me before you sign the mittimus." "What
signifies all you can say?" says the justice: "is it not here in black
and white against you? I must tell you you are a very impertinent fellow
to take up so much of my time. So make haste with his mittimus."

The clerk now acquainted the justice that among other suspicious things,
as a penknife, &c., found in Adams's pocket, they had discovered a book
written, as he apprehended, in cyphers; for no one could read a word in
it. "Ay," says the justice, "the fellow may be more than a common
robber, he may be in a plot against the Government. Produce the book."
Upon which the poor manuscript of Aeschylus, which Adams had transcribed
with his own hand, was brought forth; and the justice, looking at it,
shook his head, and, turning to the prisoner, asked the meaning of those
cyphers. "Cyphers?" answered Adams, "it is a manuscript of Aeschylus."
"Who? who?" said the justice. Adams repeated, "Aeschylus." "That is an
outlandish name," cried the clerk. "A fictitious name rather, I
believe," said the justice. One of the company declared it looked very
much like Greek. "Greek?" said the justice; "why, 'tis all writing."
"No," says the other, "I don't positively say it is so; for it is a very
long time since I have seen any Greek." "There's one," says he, turning
to the parson of the parish, who was present, "will tell us
immediately." The parson, taking up the book, and putting on his
spectacles and gravity together, muttered some words to himself, and
then pronounced aloud--"Ay, indeed, it is a Greek manuscript; a very
fine piece of antiquity. I make no doubt but it was stolen from the same
clergyman from whom the rogue took the cassock." "What did the rascal
mean by his Aeschylus?" says the justice. "Pooh!" answered the doctor,
with a contemptuous grin, "do you think that fellow knows anything of
this book? Aeschylus! ho! ho! I see now what it is--a manuscript of one
of the fathers. I know a nobleman who would give a great deal of money
for such a piece of antiquity. Ay, ay, question and answer. The
beginning is the catechism in Greek. Ay, ay, _Pollaki toi_: What's your
name?"--"Ay, what's your name?" says the justice to Adams; who answered,
"It is Aeschylus, and I will maintain it."--"Oh! it is," says the
justice: "make Mr Aeschylus his mittimus. I will teach you to banter me
with a false name."

One of the company, having looked steadfastly at Adams, asked him, "If
he did not know Lady Booby?" Upon which Adams, presently calling him to
mind, answered in a rapture, "O squire! are you there? I believe you
will inform his worship I am innocent."--"I can indeed say," replied the
squire, "that I am very much surprized to see you in this situation:"
and then, addressing himself to the justice, he said, "Sir, I assure
you Mr Adams is a clergyman, as he appears, and a gentleman of a very
good character. I wish you would enquire a little farther into this
affair; for I am convinced of his innocence."--"Nay," says the justice,
"if he is a gentleman, and you are sure he is innocent, I don't desire
to commit him, not I: I will commit the woman by herself, and take your
bail for the gentleman: look into the book, clerk, and see how it is to
take bail--come--and make the mittimus for the woman as fast as you
can."--"Sir," cries Adams, "I assure you she is as innocent as
myself."--"Perhaps," said the squire, "there may be some mistake! pray
let us hear Mr Adams's relation."--"With all my heart," answered the
justice; "and give the gentleman a glass to wet his whistle before he
begins. I know how to behave myself to gentlemen as well as another.
Nobody can say I have committed a gentleman since I have been in the
commission." Adams then began the narrative, in which, though he was
very prolix, he was uninterrupted, unless by several hums and hahs of
the justice, and his desire to repeat those parts which seemed to him
most material. When he had finished, the justice, who, on what the
squire had said, believed every syllable of his story on his bare
affirmation, notwithstanding the depositions on oath to the contrary,
began to let loose several rogues and rascals against the witness, whom
he ordered to stand forth, but in vain; the said witness, long since
finding what turn matters were likely to take, had privily withdrawn,
without attending the issue. The justice now flew into a violent
passion, and was hardly prevailed with not to commit the innocent
fellows who had been imposed on as well as himself. He swore, "They had
best find out the fellow who was guilty of perjury, and bring him before
him within two days, or he would bind them all over to their good
behaviour." They all promised to use their best endeavours to that
purpose, and were dismissed. Then the justice insisted that Mr Adams
should sit down and take a glass with him; and the parson of the parish
delivered him back the manuscript without saying a word; nor would
Adams, who plainly discerned his ignorance, expose it. As for Fanny, she
was, at her own request, recommended to the care of a maid-servant of
the house, who helped her to new dress and clean herself.

The company in the parlour had not been long seated before they were
alarmed with a horrible uproar from without, where the persons who had
apprehended Adams and Fanny had been regaling, according to the custom
of the house, with the justice's strong beer. These were all fallen
together by the ears, and were cuffing each other without any mercy. The
justice himself sallied out, and with the dignity of his presence soon
put an end to the fray. On his return into the parlour, he reported,
"That the occasion of the quarrel was no other than a dispute to whom,
if Adams had been convicted, the greater share of the reward for
apprehending him had belonged." All the company laughed at this, except
Adams, who, taking his pipe from his mouth, fetched a deep groan, and
said, "He was concerned to see so litigious a temper in men. That he
remembered a story something like it in one of the parishes where his
cure lay:--There was," continued he, "a competition between three young
fellows for the place of the clerk, which I disposed of, to the best of
my abilities, according to merit; that is, I gave it to him who had the
happiest knack at setting a psalm. The clerk was no sooner established
in his place than a contention began between the two disappointed
candidates concerning their excellence; each contending on whom, had
they two been the only competitors, my election would have fallen. This
dispute frequently disturbed the congregation, and introduced a discord
into the psalmody, till I was forced to silence them both. But, alas!
the litigious spirit could not be stifled; and, being no longer able to
vent itself in singing, it now broke forth in fighting. It produced many
battles (for they were very near a match), and I believe would have
ended fatally, had not the death of the clerk given me an opportunity to
promote one of them to his place; which presently put an end to the
dispute, and entirely reconciled the contending parties." Adams then
proceeded to make some philosophical observations on the folly of
growing warm in disputes in which neither party is interested. He then
applied himself vigorously to smoaking; and a long silence ensued, which
was at length broke by the justice, who began to sing forth his own
praises, and to value himself exceedingly on his nice discernment in the
cause which had lately been before him. He was quickly interrupted by Mr
Adams, between whom and his worship a dispute now arose, whether he
ought not, in strictness of law, to have committed him, the said Adams;
in which the latter maintained he ought to have been committed, and the
justice as vehemently held he ought not. This had most probably produced
a quarrel (for both were very violent and positive in their opinions),
had not Fanny accidentally heard that a young fellow was going from the
justice's house to the very inn where the stage-coach in which Joseph
was, put up. Upon this news, she immediately sent for the parson out of
the parlour. Adams, when he found her resolute to go (though she would
not own the reason, but pretended she could not bear to see the faces of
those who had suspected her of such a crime), was as fully determined to
go with her; he accordingly took leave of the justice and company: and
so ended a dispute in which the law seemed shamefully to intend to set a
magistrate and a divine together by the ears.



CHAPTER XII.

_A very delightful adventure, as well to the persons concerned as to the
good-natured reader._


Adams, Fanny, and the guide, set out together about one in the morning,
the moon being then just risen. They had not gone above a mile before a
most violent storm of rain obliged them to take shelter in an inn, or
rather alehouse, where Adams immediately procured himself a good fire, a
toast and ale, and a pipe, and began to smoke with great content,
utterly forgetting everything that had happened.

Fanny sat likewise down by the fire; but was much more impatient at the
storm. She presently engaged the eyes of the host, his wife, the maid of
the house, and the young fellow who was their guide; they all conceived
they had never seen anything half so handsome; and indeed, reader, if
thou art of an amorous hue, I advise thee to skip over the next
paragraph; which, to render our history perfect, we are obliged to set
down, humbly hoping that we may escape the fate of Pygmalion; for if it
should happen to us, or to thee, to be struck with this picture, we
should be perhaps in as helpless a condition as Narcissus, and might say
to ourselves, _Quod petis est nusquam_. Or, if the finest features in it
should set Lady ----'s image before our eyes, we should be still in as
bad a situation, and might say to our desires, _Coelum ipsum petimus
stultitia_.

Fanny was now in the nineteenth year of her age; she was tall and
delicately shaped; but not one of those slender young women who seem
rather intended to hang up in the hall of an anatomist than for any
other purpose. On the contrary, she was so plump that she seemed
bursting through her tight stays, especially in the part which confined
her swelling breasts. Nor did her hips want the assistance of a hoop to
extend them. The exact shape of her arms denoted the form of those limbs
which she concealed; and though they were a little reddened by her
labour, yet, if her sleeve slipped above her elbow, or her handkerchief
discovered any part of her neck, a whiteness appeared which the finest
Italian paint would be unable to reach. Her hair was of a chesnut brown,
and nature had been extremely lavish to her of it, which she had cut,
and on Sundays used to curl down her neck, in the modern fashion. Her
forehead was high, her eyebrows arched, and rather full than otherwise.
Her eyes black and sparkling; her nose just inclining to the Roman; her
lips red and moist, and her underlip, according to the opinion of the
ladies, too pouting. Her teeth were white, but not exactly even. The
small-pox had left one only mark on her chin, which was so large, it
might have been mistaken for a dimple, had not her left cheek produced
one so near a neighbour to it, that the former served only for a foil to
the latter. Her complexion was fair, a little injured by the sun, but
overspread with such a bloom that the finest ladies would have exchanged
all their white for it: add to these a countenance in which, though she
was extremely bashful, a sensibility appeared almost incredible; and a
sweetness, whenever she smiled, beyond either imitation or description.
To conclude all, she had a natural gentility, superior to the
acquisition of art, and which surprized all who beheld her.

This lovely creature was sitting by the fire with Adams, when her
attention was suddenly engaged by a voice from an inner room, which sung
the following song:--

    THE SONG.

    Say, Chloe, where must the swain stray
      Who is by thy beauties undone?
    To wash their remembrance away,
      To what distant Lethe must run?
    The wretch who is sentenced to die
      May escape, and leave justice behind;
    From his country perhaps he may fly,
      But oh! can he fly from his mind?

    O rapture! unthought of before,
      To be thus of Chloe possess'd;
    Nor she, nor no tyrant's hard power,
      Her image can tear from my breast.
    But felt not Narcissus more joy,
      With his eyes he beheld his loved charms?
    Yet what he beheld the fond boy
      More eagerly wish'd in his arms.

    How can it thy dear image be
      Which fills thus my bosom with woe?
    Can aught bear resemblance to thee
      Which grief and not joy can bestow?
    This counterfeit snatch from my heart,
      Ye pow'rs, tho' with torment I rave,
    Tho' mortal will prove the fell smart:
      I then shall find rest in my grave.

    Ah, see the dear nymph o'er the plain
      Come smiling and tripping along!
    A thousand Loves dance in her train,
      The Graces around her all throng.
    To meet her soft Zephyrus flies,
      And wafts all the sweets from the flowers,
    Ah, rogue I whilst he kisses her eyes,
      More sweets from her breath he devours.

    My soul, whilst I gaze, is on fire:
      But her looks were so tender and kind,
    My hope almost reach'd my desire,
      And left lame despair far behind.
    Transported with madness, I flew,
      And eagerly seized on my bliss;
    Her bosom but half she withdrew,
      But half she refused my fond kiss.

    Advances like these made me bold;
      I whisper'd her--Love, we're alone.--
    The rest let immortals unfold;
      No language can tell but their own.
    Ah, Chloe, expiring, I cried,
      How long I thy cruelty bore!
    Ah, Strephon, she blushing replied,
      You ne'er was so pressing before.

Adams had been ruminating all this time on a passage in Aeschylus,
without attending in the least to the voice, though one of the most
melodious that ever was heard, when, casting his eyes on Fanny, he cried
out, "Bless us, you look extremely pale!"--"Pale! Mr Adams," says she;
"O Jesus!" and fell backwards in her chair. Adams jumped up, flung his
Aeschylus into the fire, and fell a-roaring to the people of the house
for help. He soon summoned every one into the room, and the songster
among the rest; but, O reader! when this nightingale, who was no other
than Joseph Andrews himself, saw his beloved Fanny in the situation we
have described her, canst thou conceive the agitations of his mind? If
thou canst not, waive that meditation to behold his happiness, when,
clasping her in his arms, he found life and blood returning into her
cheeks: when he saw her open her beloved eyes, and heard her with the
softest accent whisper, "Are you Joseph Andrews?"--"Art thou my Fanny?"
he answered eagerly: and, pulling her to his heart, he imprinted
numberless kisses on her lips, without considering who were present.

If prudes are offended at the lusciousness of this picture, they may
take their eyes off from it, and survey parson Adams dancing about the
room in a rapture of joy. Some philosophers may perhaps doubt whether he
was not the happiest of the three: for the goodness of his heart enjoyed
the blessings which were exulting in the breasts of both the other two,
together with his own. But we shall leave such disquisitions, as too
deep for us, to those who are building some favourite hypothesis, which
they will refuse no metaphysical rubbish to erect and support: for our
part, we give it clearly on the side of Joseph, whose happiness was not
only greater than the parson's, but of longer duration: for as soon as
the first tumults of Adams's rapture were over he cast his eyes towards
the fire, where Aeschylus lay expiring; and immediately rescued the
poor remains, to wit, the sheepskin covering, of his dear friend, which
was the work of his own hands, and had been his inseparable companion
for upwards of thirty years.

Fanny had no sooner perfectly recovered herself than she began to
restrain the impetuosity of her transports; and, reflecting on what she
had done and suffered in the presence of so many, she was immediately
covered with confusion; and, pushing Joseph gently from her, she begged
him to be quiet, nor would admit of either kiss or embrace any longer.
Then, seeing Mrs Slipslop, she curtsied, and offered to advance to her;
but that high woman would not return her curtsies; but, casting her eyes
another way, immediately withdrew into another room, muttering, as she
went, she wondered who the creature was.



CHAPTER XIII.

_A dissertation concerning high people and low people, with Mrs
Slipslop's departure in no very good temper of mind, and the evil plight
in which she left Adams and his company._


It will doubtless seem extremely odd to many readers, that Mrs Slipslop,
who had lived several years in the same house with Fanny, should, in a
short separation, utterly forget her. And indeed the truth is, that she
remembered her very well. As we would not willingly, therefore, that
anything should appear unnatural in this our history, we will endeavour
to explain the reasons of herhe first requisites to which I apprehended were to be supplied by a
taylor, a periwig-maker, and some few more tradesmen, who deal in
furnishing out the human body. Notwithstanding the lowness of my purse,
I found credit with them more easily than I expected, and was soon
equipped to my wish. This I own then agreeably surprized me; but I have
since learned that it is a maxim among many tradesmen at the polite end
of the town to deal as largely as they can, reckon as high as they can,
and arrest as soon as they can.

The next qualifications, namely, dancing, fencing, riding the great
horse, and music, came into my head: but, as they required expense and
time, I comforted myself, with regard to dancing, that I had learned a
little in my youth, and could walk a minuet genteelly enough; as to
fencing, I thought my good-humour would preserve me from the danger of a
quarrel; as to the horse, I hoped it would not be thought of; and for
music, I imagined I could easily acquire the reputation of it; for I had
heard some of my schoolfellows pretend to knowledge in operas, without
being able to sing or play on the fiddle.

Knowledge of the town seemed another ingredient; this I thought I should
arrive at by frequenting public places. Accordingly I paid constant
attendance to them all; by which means I was soon master of the
fashionable phrases, learned to cry up the fashionable diversions, and
knew the names and faces of the most fashionable men and women.

Nothing now seemed to remain but an intrigue, which I was resolved to
have immediately; I mean the reputation of it; and indeed I was so
successful, that in a very short time I had half-a-dozen with the finest
women in town.

At these words Adams fetched a deep groan, and then, blessing himself,
cried out, "Good Lord! what wicked times these are!"

Not so wicked as you imagine, continued the gentleman; for I assure you
they were all vestal virgins for anything which I knew to the contrary.
The reputation of intriguing with them was all I sought, and was what I
arrived at: and perhaps I only flattered myself even in that; for very
probably the persons to whom I showed their billets knew as well as I
that they were counterfeits, and that I had written them to myself.
"Write letters to yourself!" said Adams, staring. O sir, answered the
gentleman, it is the very error of the times. Half our modern plays have
one of these characters in them. It is incredible the pains I have
taken, and the absurd methods I employed, to traduce the character of
women of distinction. When another had spoken in raptures of any one, I
have answered, "D--n her, she! We shall have her at H----d's very soon."
When he hath replied, "He thought her virtuous," I have answered, "Ay,
thou wilt always think a woman virtuous, till she is in the streets; but
you and I, Jack or Tom (turning to another in company), know better." At
which I have drawn a paper out of my pocket, perhaps a taylor's bill,
and kissed it, crying at the same time, "By Gad I was once fond of her."

"Proceed, if you please, but do not swear any more," said Adams.

Sir, said the gentleman, I ask your pardon. Well, sir, in this course of
life I continued full three years.--"What course of life?" answered
Adams; "I do not remember you have mentioned any."--Your remark is just,
said the gentleman, smiling; I should rather have said, in this course
of doing nothing. I remember some time afterwards I wrote the journal of
one day, which would serve, I believe, as well for any other during the
whole time. I will endeavour to repeat it to you.

In the morning I arose, took my great stick, and walked out in my green
frock, with my hair in papers (a groan from Adams), and sauntered about
till ten. Went to the auction; told lady ---- she had a dirty face;
laughed heartily at something captain ---- said, I can't remember what,
for I did not very well hear it; whispered lord ----; bowed to the duke
of ----; and was going to bid for a snuff-box, but did not, for fear I
should have had it.

    From  2 to 4, drest myself.  _A groan._
          4 to 6, dined.         _A groan._
          6 to 8, coffee-house.
          8 to 9, Drury-lane playhouse.
          9 to 10, Lincoln's Inn Fields.
         10 to 12, Drawing-room. _A great groan._

At all which places nothing happened worth remark.

At which Adams said, with some vehemence, "Sir, this is below the life
of an animal, hardly above vegetation: and I am surprized what could
lead a man of your sense into it." What leads us into more follies than
you imagine, doctor, answered the gentleman--vanity; for as contemptible
a creature as I was, and I assure you, yourself cannot have more
contempt for such a wretch than I now have, I then admired myself, and
should have despised a person of your present appearance (you will
pardon me), with all your learning and those excellent qualities which I
have remarked in you. Adams bowed, and begged him to proceed. After I
had continued two years in this course of life, said the gentleman, an
accident happened which obliged me to change the scene. As I was one day
at St James's coffee-house, making very free with the character of a
young lady of quality, an officer of the guards, who was present,
thought proper to give me the lye. I answered I might possibly be
mistaken, but I intended to tell no more than the truth. To which he
made no reply but by a scornful sneer. After this I observed a strange
coldness in all my acquaintance; none of them spoke to me first, and
very few returned me even the civility of a bow. The company I used to
dine with left me out, and within a week I found myself in as much
solitude at St James's as if I had been in a desart. An honest elderly
man, with a great hat and long sword, at last told me he had a
compassion for my youth, and therefore advised me to show the world I
was not such a rascal as they thought me to be. I did not at first
understand him; but he explained himself, and ended with telling me, if
I would write a challenge to the captain, he would, out of pure charity,
go to him with it. "A very charitable person, truly!" cried Adams. I
desired till the next day, continued the gentleman, to consider on it,
and, retiring to my lodgings, I weighed the consequences on both sides
as fairly as I could. On the one, I saw the risk of this alternative,
either losing my own life, or having on my hands the blood of a man with
whom I was not in the least angry. I soon determined that the good which
appeared on the other was not worth this hazard. I therefore resolved to
quit the scene, and presently retired to the Temple, where I took
chambers. Here I soon got a fresh set of acquaintance, who knew nothing
of what had happened to me. Indeed, they were not greatly to my
approbation; for the beaus of the Temple are only the shadows of the
others. They are the affectation of affectation. The vanity of these is
still more ridiculous, if possible, than of the others. Here I met with
smart fellows who drank with lords they did not know, and intrigued with
women they never saw. Covent Garden was now the farthest stretch of my
ambition; where I shone forth in the balconies at the playhouses,
visited whores, made love to orange-wenches, and damned plays. This
career was soon put a stop to by my surgeon, who convinced me of the
necessity of confining myself to my room for a month. At the end of
which, having had leisure to reflect, I resolved to quit all farther
conversation with beaus and smarts of every kind, and to avoid, if
possible, any occasion of returning to this place of confinement. "I
think," said Adams, "the advice of a month's retirement and reflection
was very proper; but I should rather have expected it from a divine than
a surgeon." The gentleman smiled at Adams's simplicity, and, without
explaining himself farther on such an odious subject, went on thus: I
was no sooner perfectly restored to health than I found my passion for
women, which I was afraid to satisfy as I had done, made me very uneasy;
I determined, therefore, to keep a mistress. Nor was I long before I
fixed my choice on a young woman, who had before been kept by two
gentlemen, and to whom I was recommended by a celebrated bawd. I took
her home to my chambers, and made her a settlement during cohabitation.
This would, perhaps, have been very ill paid: however, she did not
suffer me to be perplexed on that account; for, before quarter-day, I
found her at my chambers in too familiar conversation with a young
fellow who was drest like an officer, but was indeed a city apprentice.
Instead of excusing her inconstancy, she rapped out half-a-dozen oaths,
and, snapping her fingers at me, swore she scorned to confine herself to
the best man in England. Upon this we parted, and the same bawd
presently provided her another keeper. I was not so much concerned at
our separation as I found, within a day or two, I had reason to be for
our meeting; for I was obliged to pay a second visit to my surgeon. I
was now forced to do penance for some weeks, during which time I
contracted an acquaintance with a beautiful young girl, the daughter of
a gentleman who, after having been forty years in the army, and in all
the campaigns under the Duke of Marlborough, died a lieutenant on
half-pay, and had left a widow, with this only child, in very distrest
circumstances: they had only a small pension from the government, with
what little the daughter could add to it by her work, for she had great
excellence at her needle. This girl was, at my first acquaintance with
her, solicited in marriage by a young fellow in good circumstances. He
was apprentice to a linendraper, and had a little fortune, sufficient to
set up his trade. The mother was greatly pleased with this match, as
indeed she had sufficient reason. However, I soon prevented it. I
represented him in so low a light to his mistress, and made so good an
use of flattery, promises, and presents, that, not to dwell longer on
this subject than is necessary, I prevailed with the poor girl, and
conveyed her away from her mother! In a word, I debauched her.--(At
which words Adams started up, fetched three strides across the room, and
then replaced himself in his chair.) You are not more affected with this
part of my story than myself; I assure you it will never be sufficiently
repented of in my own opinion: but, if you already detest it, how much
more will your indignation be raised when you hear the fatal
consequences of this barbarous, this villanous action! If you please,
therefore, I will here desist.--"By no means," cries Adams; "go on, I
beseech you; and Heaven grant you may sincerely repent of this and many
other things you have related!"--I was now, continued the gentleman, as
happy as the possession of a fine young creature, who had a good
education, and was endued with many agreeable qualities, could make me.
We lived some months with vast fondness together, without any company or
conversation, more than we found in one another: but this could not
continue always; and, though I still preserved great affection for her,
I began more and more to want the relief of other company, and
consequently to leave her by degrees--at last whole days to herself. She
failed not to testify some uneasiness on these occasions, and complained
of the melancholy life she led; to remedy which, I introduced her into
the acquaintance of some other kept mistresses, with whom she used to
play at cards, and frequent plays and other diversions. She had not
lived long in this intimacy before I perceived a visible alteration in
her behaviour; all her modesty and innocence vanished by degrees, till
her mind became thoroughly tainted. She affected the company of rakes,
gave herself all manner of airs, was never easy but abroad, or when she
had a party at my chambers. She was rapacious of money, extravagant to
excess, loose in her conversation; and, if ever I demurred to any of her
demands, oaths, tears, and fits were the immediate consequences. As the
first raptures of fondness were long since over, this behaviour soon
estranged my affections from her; I began to reflect with pleasure that
she was not my wife, and to conceive an intention of parting with her;
of which, having given her a hint, she took care to prevent me the pains
of turning her out of doors, and accordingly departed herself, having
first broken open my escrutore, and taken with her all she could find,
to the amount of about £200. In the first heat of my resentment I
resolved to pursue her with all the vengeance of the law: but, as she
had the good luck to escape me during that ferment, my passion
afterwards cooled; and, having reflected that I had been the first
aggressor, and had done her an injury for which I could make her no
reparation, by robbing her of the innocence of her mind; and hearing at
the same time that the poor old woman her mother had broke her heart on
her daughter's elopement from her, I, concluding myself her murderer
("As you very well might," cries Adams, with a groan), was pleased that
God Almighty had taken this method of punishing me, and resolved quietly
to submit to the loss. Indeed, I could wish I had never heard more of
the poor creature, who became in the end an abandoned profligate; and,
after being some years a common prostitute, at last ended her miserable
life in Newgate.--Here the gentleman fetched a deep sigh, which Mr Adams
echoed very loudly; and both continued silent, looking on each other for
some minutes. At last the gentleman proceeded thus: I had been perfectly
constant to this girl during the whole time I kept her: but she had
scarce departed before I discovered more marks of her infidelity to me
than the loss of my money. In short, I was forced to make a third visit
to my surgeon, out of whose hands I did not get a hasty discharge.


I now forswore all future dealings with the sex, complained loudly that
the pleasure did not compensate the pain, and railed at the beautiful
creatures in as gross language as Juvenal himself formerly reviled them
in. I looked on all the town harlots with a detestation not easy to be
conceived, their persons appeared to me as painted palaces, inhabited by
Disease and Death: nor could their beauty make them more desirable
objects in my eyes than gilding could make me covet a pill, or golden
plates a coffin. But though I was no longer the absolute slave, I found
some reasons to own myself still the subject, of love. My hatred for
women decreased daily; and I am not positive but time might have
betrayed me again to some common harlot, had I not been secured by a
passion for the charming Sapphira, which, having once entered upon, made
a violent progress in my heart. Sapphira was wife to a man of fashion
and gallantry, and one who seemed, I own, every way worthy of her
affections; which, however, he had not the reputation of having. She was
indeed a coquette _achevée_. "Pray, sir," says Adams, "what is a
coquette? I have met with the word in French authors, but never could
assign any idea to it. I believe it is the same with _une sotte,_
Anglicè, a fool." Sir, answered the gentleman, perhaps you are not much
mistaken; but, as it is a particular kind of folly, I will endeavour to
describe it. Were all creatures to be ranked in the order of creation
according to their usefulness, I know few animals that would not take
place of a coquette; nor indeed hath this creature much pretence to
anything beyond instinct; for, though sometimes we might imagine it was
animated by the passion of vanity, yet far the greater part of its
actions fall beneath even that low motive; for instance, several absurd
gestures and tricks, infinitely more foolish than what can be observed
in the most ridiculous birds and beasts, and which would persuade the
beholder that the silly wretch was aiming at our contempt. Indeed its
characteristic is affectation, and this led and governed by whim only:
for as beauty, wisdom, wit, good-nature, politeness, and health are
sometimes affected by this creature, so are ugliness, folly, nonsense,
ill-nature, ill-breeding, and sickness likewise put on by it in their
turn. Its life is one constant lie; and the only rule by which you can
form any judgment of them is, that they are never what they seem. If it
was possible for a coquette to love (as it is not, for if ever it
attains this passion the coquette ceases instantly), it would wear the
face of indifference, if not of hatred, to the beloved object; you may
therefore be assured, when they endeavour to persuade you of their
liking, that they are indifferent to you at least. And indeed this was
the case of my Sapphira, who no sooner saw me in the number of her
admirers than she gave me what is commonly called encouragement: she
would often look at me, and, when she perceived me meet her eyes, would
instantly take them off, discovering at the same time as much surprize
and emotion as possible. These arts failed not of the success she
intended; and, as I grew more particular to her than the rest of her
admirers, she advanced, in proportion, more directly to me than to the
others. She affected the low voice, whisper, lisp, sigh, start, laugh,
and many other indications of passion which daily deceive thousands.
When I played at whist with her, she would look earnestly at me, and at
the same time lose deal or revoke; then burst into a ridiculous laugh
and cry, "La! I can't imagine what I was thinking of." To detain you no
longer, after I had gone through a sufficient course of gallantry, as I
thought, and was thoroughly convinced I had raised a violent passion in
my mistress, I sought an opportunity of coming to an eclaircissement
with her. She avoided this as much as possible; however, great assiduity
at length presented me one. I will not describe all the particulars of
this interview; let it suffice that, when she could no longer pretend
not to see my drift, she first affected a violent surprize, and
immediately after as violent a passion: she wondered what I had seen in
her conduct which could induce me to affront her in this manner; and,
breaking from me the first moment she could, told me I had no other way
to escape the consequence of her resentment than by never seeing, or at
least speaking to her more. I was not contented with this answer; I
still pursued her, but to no purpose; and was at length convinced that
her husband had the sole possession of her person, and that neither he
nor any other had made any impression on her heart. I was taken off from
following this _ignis fatuus_ by some advances which were made me by the
wife of a citizen, who, though neither very young nor handsome, was yet
too agreeable to be rejected by my amorous constitution. I accordingly
soon satisfied her that she had not cast away her hints on a barren or
cold soil: on the contrary, they instantly produced her an eager and
desiring lover. Nor did she give me any reason to complain; she met the
warmth she had raised with equal ardour. I had no longer a coquette to
deal with, but one who was wiser than to prostitute the noble passion of
love to the ridiculous lust of vanity. We presently understood one
another; and, as the pleasures we sought lay in a mutual gratification,
we soon found and enjoyed them. I thought myself at first greatly happy
in the possession of this new mistress, whose fondness would have
quickly surfeited a more sickly appetite; but it had a different effect
on mine: she carried my passion higher by it than youth or beauty had
been able. But my happiness could not long continue uninterrupted. The
apprehensions we lay under from the jealousy of her husband gave us
great uneasiness. "Poor wretch! I pity him," cried Adams. He did indeed
deserve it, said the gentleman; for he loved his wife with great
tenderness; and, I assure you, it is a great satisfaction to me that I
was not the man who first seduced her affections from him. These
apprehensions appeared also too well grounded, for in the end he
discovered us, and procured witnesses of our caresses. He then
prosecuted me at law, and recovered £3000 damages, which much distressed
my fortune to pay; and, what was worse, his wife, being divorced, came
upon my hands. I led a very uneasy life with her; for, besides that my
passion was now much abated, her excessive jealousy was very
troublesome. At length death rid me of an inconvenience which the
consideration of my having been the author of her misfortunes would
never suffer me to take any other method of discarding.

I now bad adieu to love, and resolved to pursue other less dangerous and
expensive pleasures. I fell into the acquaintance of a set of jolly
companions, who slept all day and drank all night; fellows who might
rather be said to consume time than to live. Their best conversation was
nothing but noise: singing, hollowing, wrangling, drinking, toasting,
sp--wing, smoaking were the chief ingredients of our entertainment. And
yet, bad as these were, they were more tolerable than our graver scenes,
which were either excessive tedious narratives of dull common matters of
fact, or hot disputes about trifling matters, which commonly ended in a
wager. This way of life the first serious reflection put a period to;
and I became member of a club frequented by young men of great
abilities. The bottle was now only called in to the assistance of our
conversation, which rolled on the deepest points of philosophy. These
gentlemen were engaged in a search after truth, in the pursuit of which
they threw aside all the prejudices of education, and governed
themselves only by the infallible guide of human reason. This great
guide, after having shown them the falsehood of that very ancient but
simple tenet, that there is such a being as a Deity in the universe,
helped them to establish in his stead a certain rule of right, by
adhering to which they all arrived at the utmost purity of morals.
Reflection made me as much delighted with this society as it had taught
me to despise and detest the former. I began now to esteem myself a
being of a higher order than I had ever before conceived; and was the
more charmed with this rule of right, as I really found in my own nature
nothing repugnant to it. I held in utter contempt all persons who wanted
any other inducement to virtue besides her intrinsic beauty and
excellence; and had so high an opinion of my present companions, with
regard to their morality, that I would have trusted them with whatever
was nearest and dearest to me. Whilst I was engaged in this delightful
dream, two or three accidents happened successively, which at first much
surprized me;--for one of our greatest philosophers, or rule-of-right
men, withdrew himself from us, taking with him the wife of one of his
most intimate friends. Secondly, another of the same society left the
club without remembering to take leave of his bail. A third, having
borrowed a sum of money of me, for which I received no security, when I
asked him to repay it, absolutely denied the loan. These several
practices, so inconsistent with our golden rule, made me begin to
suspect its infallibility; but when I communicated my thoughts to one of
the club, he said, "There was nothing absolutely good or evil in itself;
that actions were denominated good or bad by the circumstances of the
agent. That possibly the man who ran away with his neighbour's wife
might be one of very good inclinations, but over-prevailed on by the
violence of an unruly passion; and, in other particulars, might be a
very worthy member of society; that if the beauty of any woman created
in him an uneasiness, he had a right from nature to relieve
himself;"--with many other things, which I then detested so much, that I
took leave of the society that very evening and never returned to it
again. Being now reduced to a state of solitude which I did not like, I
became a great frequenter of the playhouses, which indeed was always my
favourite diversion; and most evenings passed away two or three hours
behind the scenes, where I met with several poets, with whom I made
engagements at the taverns. Some of the players were likewise of our
parties. At these meetings we were generally entertained by the poets
with reading their performances, and by the players with repeating their
parts: upon which occasions, I observed the gentleman who furnished our
entertainment was commonly the best pleased of the company; who, though
they were pretty civil to him to his face, seldom failed to take the
first opportunity of his absence to ridicule him. Now I made some
remarks which probably are too obvious to be worth relating. "Sir," says
Adams, "your remarks if you please." First then, says he, I concluded
that the general observation, that wits are most inclined to vanity, is
not true. Men are equally vain of riches, strength, beauty, honours, &c.
But these appear of themselves to the eyes of the beholders, whereas the
poor wit is obliged to produce his performance to show you his
perfection; and on his readiness to do this that vulgar opinion I have
before mentioned is grounded; but doth not the person who expends vast
sums in the furniture of his house or the ornaments of his person, who
consumes much time and employs great pains in dressing himself, or who
thinks himself paid for self-denial, labour, or even villany, by a title
or a ribbon, sacrifice as much to vanity as the poor wit who is desirous
to read you his poem or his play? My second remark was, that vanity is
the worst of passions, and more apt to contaminate the mind than any
other: for, as selfishness is much more general than we please to allow
it, so it is natural to hate and envy those who stand between us and the
good we desire. Now, in lust and ambition these are few; and even in
avarice we find many who are no obstacles to our pursuits; but the vain
man seeks pre-eminence; and everything which is excellent or
praiseworthy in another renders him the mark of his antipathy. Adams now
began to fumble in his pockets, and soon cried out, "O la! I have it not
about me." Upon this, the gentleman asking him what he was searching
for, he said he searched after a sermon, which he thought his
masterpiece, against vanity. "Fie upon it, fie upon it!" cries he, "why
do I ever leave that sermon out of my pocket? I wish it was within five
miles; I would willingly fetch it, to read it you." The gentleman
answered that there was no need, for he was cured of the passion. "And
for that very reason," quoth Adams, "I would read it, for I am confident
you would admire it: indeed, I have never been a greater enemy to any
passion than that silly one of vanity." The gentleman smiled, and
proceeded--From this society I easily passed to that of the gamesters,
where nothing remarkable happened but the finishing my fortune, which
those gentlemen soon helped me to the end of. This opened scenes of life
hitherto unknown; poverty and distress, with their horrid train of duns,
attorneys, bailiffs, haunted me day and night. My clothes grew shabby,
my credit bad, my friends and acquaintance of all kinds cold. In this
situation the strangest thought imaginable came into my head; and what
was this but to write a play? for I had sufficient leisure: fear of
bailiffs confined me every day to my room: and, having always had a
little inclination and something of a genius that way, I set myself to
work, and within a few months produced a piece of five acts, which was
accepted of at the theatre. I remembered to have formerly taken tickets
of other poets for their benefits, long before the appearance of their
performances; and, resolving to follow a precedent which was so well
suited to my present circumstances, I immediately provided myself with a
large number of little papers. Happy indeed would be the state of
poetry, would these tickets pass current at the bakehouse, the
ale-house, and the chandler's shop: but alas! far otherwise; no taylor
will take them in payment for buckram, canvas, stay-tape; nor no bailiff
for civility money. They are, indeed, no more than a passport to beg
with; a certificate that the owner wants five shillings, which induces
well-disposed Christians to charity. I now experienced what is worse
than poverty, or rather what is the worst consequence of poverty--I mean
attendance and dependance on the great. Many a morning have I waited
hours in the cold parlours of men of quality; where, after seeing the
lowest rascals in lace and embroidery, the pimps and buffoons in
fashion, admitted, I have been sometimes told, on sending in my name,
that my lord could not possibly see me this morning; a sufficient
assurance that I should never more get entrance into that house.
Sometimes I have been at last admitted; and the great man hath thought
proper to excuse himself, by telling me he was tied up. "Tied up," says
Adams, "pray what's that?" Sir, says the gentleman, the profit which
booksellers allowed authors for the best works was so very small, that
certain men of birth and fortune some years ago, who were the patrons of
wit and learning, thought fit to encourage them farther by entering into
voluntary subscriptions for their encouragement. Thus Prior, Rowe, Pope,
and some other men of genius, received large sums for their labours from
the public. This seemed so easy a method of getting money, that many of
the lowest scribblers of the times ventured to publish their works in
the same way; and many had the assurance to take in subscriptions for
what was not writ, nor ever intended. Subscriptions in this manner
growing infinite, and a kind of tax on the publick, some persons,
finding it not so easy a task to discern good from bad authors, or to
know what genius was worthy encouragement and what was not, to prevent
the expense of subscribing to so many, invented a method to excuse
themselves from all subscriptions whatever; and this was to receive a
small sum of money in consideration of giving a large one if ever they
subscribed; which many have done, and many more have pretended to have
done, in order to silence all solicitation. The same method was likewise
taken with playhouse tickets, which were no less a public grievance; and
this is what they call being tied up from subscribing. "I can't say but
the term is apt enough, and somewhat typical," said Adams; "for a man of
large fortune, who ties himself up, as you call it, from the
encouragement of men of merit, ought to be tied up in reality." Well,
sir, says the gentleman, to return to my story. Sometimes I have
received a guinea from a man of quality, given with as ill a grace as
alms are generally to the meanest beggar; and purchased too with as much
time spent in attendance as, if it had been spent in honest industry,
might have brought me more profit with infinitely more satisfaction.
After about two months spent in this disagreeable way, with the utmost
mortification, when I was pluming my hopes on the prospect of a
plentiful harvest from my play, upon applying to the prompter to know
when it came into rehearsal, he informed me he had received orders from
the managers to return me the play again, for that they could not
possibly act it that season; but, if I would take it and revise it
against the next, they would be glad to see it again. I snatched it from
him with great indignation, and retired to my room, where I threw myself
on the bed in a fit of despair. "You should rather have thrown yourself
on your knees," says Adams, "for despair is sinful." As soon, continued
the gentleman, as I had indulged the first tumult of my passion, I began
to consider coolly what course I should take, in a situation without
friends, money, credit, or reputation of any kind. After revolving many
things in my mind, I could see no other possibility of furnishing myself
with the miserable necessaries of life than to retire to a garret near
the Temple, and commence hackney-writer to the lawyers, for which I was
well qualified, being an excellent penman. This purpose I resolved on,
and immediately put it in execution. I had an acquaintance with an
attorney who had formerly transacted affairs for me, and to him I
applied; but, instead of furnishing me with any business, he laughed at
my undertaking, and told me, "He was afraid I should turn his deeds into
plays, and he should expect to see them on the stage." Not to tire you
with instances of this kind from others, I found that Plato himself did
not hold poets in greater abhorrence than these men of business do.
Whenever I durst venture to a coffeehouse, which was on Sundays only, a
whisper ran round the room, which was constantly attended with a
sneer--That's poet Wilson; for I know not whether you have observed it,
but there is a malignity in the nature of man, which, when not weeded
out, or at least covered by a good education and politeness, delights in
making another uneasy or dissatisfied with himself. This abundantly
appears in all assemblies, except those which are filled by people of
fashion, and especially among the younger people of both sexes whose
birth and fortunes place them just without the polite circles; I mean
the lower class of the gentry, and the higher of the mercantile world,
who are, in reality, the worst-bred part of mankind. Well, sir, whilst I
continued in this miserable state, with scarce sufficient business to
keep me from starving, the reputation of a poet being my bane, I
accidentally became acquainted with a bookseller, who told me, "It was a
pity a man of my learning and genius should be obliged to such a method
of getting his livelihood; that he had a compassion for me, and, if I
would engage with him, he would undertake to provide handsomely for me."
A man in my circumstances, as he very well knew, had no choice. I
accordingly accepted his proposal with his conditions, which were none
of the most favourable, and fell to translating with all my might. I had
no longer reason to lament the want of business; for he furnished me
with so much, that in half a year I almost writ myself blind. I likewise
contracted a distemper by my sedentary life, in which no part of my body
was exercised but my right arm, which rendered me incapable of writing
for a long time. This unluckily happening to delay the publication of a
work, and my last performance not having sold well, the bookseller
declined any further engagement, and aspersed me to his brethren as a
careless idle fellow. I had, however, by having half worked and half
starved myself to death during the time I was in his service, saved a
few guineas, with which I bought a lottery-ticket, resolving to throw
myself into Fortune's lap, and try if she would make me amends for the
injuries she had done me at the gaming-table. This purchase, being made,
left me almost pennyless; when, as if I had not been sufficiently
miserable, a bailiff in woman's clothes got admittance to my chamber,
whither he was directed by the bookseller. He arrested me at my taylor's
suit for thirty-five pounds; a sum for which I could not procure bail;
and was therefore conveyed to his house, where I was locked up in an
upper chamber. I had now neither health (for I was scarce recovered from
my indisposition), liberty, money, or friends; and had abandoned all
hopes, and even the desire, of life. "But this could not last long,"
said Adams; "for doubtless the taylor released you the moment he was
truly acquainted with your affairs, and knew that your circumstances
would not permit you to pay him." "Oh, sir," answered the gentleman, "he
knew that before he arrested me; nay, he knew that nothing but
incapacity could prevent me paying my debts; for I had been his customer
many years, had spent vast sums of money with him, and had always paid
most punctually in my prosperous days; but when I reminded him of this,
with assurances that, if he would not molest my endeavours, I would pay
him all the money I could by my utmost labour and industry procure,
reserving only what was sufficient to preserve me alive, he answered,
his patience was worn out; that I had put him off from time to time;
that he wanted the money; that he had put it into a lawyer's hands; and
if I did not pay him immediately, or find security, I must die in gaol
and expect no mercy." "He may expect mercy," cries Adams, starting from
his chair, "where he will find none! How can such a wretch repeat the
Lord's Prayer; where the word, which is translated, I know not for what
reason, trespasses, is in the original, debts? And as surely as we do
not forgive others their debts, when they are unable to pay them, so
surely shall we ourselves be unforgiven when we are in no condition of
paying." He ceased, and the gentleman proceeded. While I was in this
deplorable situation, a former acquaintance, to whom I had communicated
my lottery-ticket, found me out, and, making me a visit, with great
delight in his countenance, shook me heartily by the hand, and wished me
joy of my good fortune: for, says he, your ticket is come up a prize of
£3000. Adams snapped his fingers at these words in an ecstasy of joy;
which, however, did not continue long; for the gentleman thus
proceeded:--Alas! sir, this was only a trick of Fortune to sink me the
deeper; for I had disposed of this lottery-ticket two days before to a
relation, who refused lending me a shilling without it, in order to
procure myself bread. As soon as my friend was acquainted with my
unfortunate sale he began to revile me and remind me of all the
ill-conduct and miscarriages of my life. He said I was one whom Fortune
could not save if she would; that I was now ruined without any hopes of
retrieval, nor must expect any pity from my friends; that it would be
extreme weakness to compassionate the misfortunes of a man who ran
headlong to his own destruction. He then painted to me, in as lively
colours as he was able, the happiness I should have now enjoyed, had I
not foolishly disposed of my ticket. I urged the plea of necessity; but
he made no answer to that, and began again to revile me, till I could
bear it no longer, and desired him to finish his visit. I soon exchanged
the bailiff's house for a prison; where, as I had not money sufficient
to procure me a separate apartment, I was crouded in with a great number
of miserable wretches, in common with whom I was destitute of every
convenience of life, even that which all the brutes enjoy, wholesome
air. In these dreadful circumstances I applied by letter to several of
my old acquaintance, and such to whom I had formerly lent money without
any great prospect of its being returned, for their assistance; but in
vain. An excuse, instead of a denial, was the gentlest answer I
received. Whilst I languished in a condition too horrible to be
described, and which, in a land of humanity, and, what is much more,
Christianity, seems a strange punishment for a little inadvertency and
indiscretion; whilst I was in this condition, a fellow came into the
prison, and, enquiring me out, delivered me the following letter:--

    "SIR,--My father, to whom you sold your ticket in the last
    lottery, died the same day in which it came up a prize, as you
    have possibly heard, and left me sole heiress of all his
    fortune. I am so much touched with your present circumstances,
    and the uneasiness you must feel at having been driven to
    dispose of what might have made you happy, that I must desire
    your acceptance of the enclosed, and am your humble servant,

    "HARRIET HEARTY."

And what do you think was enclosed? "I don't know," cried Adams; "not
less than a guinea, I hope." Sir, it was a bank-note for £200.--"£200?"
says Adams, in a rapture. No less, I assure you, answered the gentleman;
a sum I was not half so delighted with as with the dear name of the
generous girl that sent it me; and who was not only the best but the
handsomest creature in the universe, and for whom I had long had a
passion which I never durst disclose to her. I kissed her name a
thousand times, my eyes overflowing with tenderness and gratitude; I
repeated--But not to detain you with these raptures, I immediately
acquired my liberty; and, having paid all my debts, departed, with
upwards of fifty pounds in my pocket, to thank my kind deliverer. She
happened to be then out of town, a circumstance which, upon reflection,
pleased me; for by that means I had an opportunity to appear before her
in a more decent dress. At her return to town, within a day or two, I
threw myself at her feet with the most ardent acknowledgments, which she
rejected with an unfeigned greatness of mind, and told me I could not
oblige her more than by never mentioning, or if possible thinking on, a
circumstance which must bring to my mind an accident that might be
grievous to me to think on. She proceeded thus: "What I have done is in
my own eyes a trifle, and perhaps infinitely less than would have become
me to do. And if you think of engaging in any business where a larger
sum may be serviceable to you, I shall not be over-rigid either as to
the security or interest." I endeavoured to express all the gratitude in
my power to this profusion of goodness, though perhaps it was my enemy,
and began to afflict my mind with more agonies than all the miseries I
had underwent; it affected me with severer reflections than poverty,
distress, and prisons united had been able to make me feel; for, sir,
these acts and professions of kindness, which were sufficient to have
raised in a good heart the most violent passion of friendship to one of
the same, or to age and ugliness in a different sex, came to me from a
woman, a young and beautiful woman; one whose perfections I had long
known, and for whom I had long conceived a violent passion, though with
a despair which made me endeavour rather to curb and conceal, than to
nourish or acquaint her with it. In short, they came upon me united with
beauty, softness, and tenderness: such bewitching smiles!--O Mr Adams,
in that moment I lost myself, and, forgetting our different situations,
nor considering what return I was making to her goodness by desiring
her, who had given me so much, to bestow her all, I laid gently hold on
her hand, and, conveying it to my lips, I prest it with inconceivable
ardour; then, lifting up my swimming eyes, I saw her face and neck
overspread with one blush; she offered to withdraw her hand, yet not so
as to deliver it from mine, though I held it with the gentlest force. We
both stood trembling; her eyes cast on the ground, and mine stedfastly
fixed on her. Good G--d, what was then the condition of my soul! burning
with love, desire, admiration, gratitude, and every tender passion, all
bent on one charming object. Passion at last got the better of both
reason and respect, and, softly letting go her hand, I offered madly to
clasp her in my arms; when, a little recovering herself, she started
from me, asking me, with some show of anger, "If she had any reason to
expect this treatment from me." I then fell prostrate before her, and
told her, if I had offended, my life was absolutely in her power, which
I would in any manner lose for her sake. Nay, madam, said I, you shall
not be so ready to punish me as I to suffer. I own my guilt. I detest
the reflection that I would have sacrificed your happiness to mine.
Believe me, I sincerely repent my ingratitude; yet, believe me too, it
was my passion, my unbounded passion for you, which hurried me so far: I
have loved you long and tenderly, and the goodness you have shown me
hath innocently weighed down a wretch undone before. Acquit me of all
mean, mercenary views; and, before I take my leave of you for ever,
which I am resolved instantly to do, believe me that Fortune could have
raised me to no height to which I could not have gladly lifted you. O,
curst be Fortune!--"Do not," says she, interrupting me with the sweetest
voice, "do not curse Fortune, since she hath made me happy; and, if she
hath put your happiness in my power, I have told you you shall ask
nothing in reason which I will refuse." Madam, said I, you mistake me if
you imagine, as you seem, my happiness is in the power of Fortune now.
You have obliged me too much already; if I have any wish, it is for some
blest accident, by which I may contribute with my life to the least
augmentation of your felicity. As for myself, the only happiness I can
ever have will be hearing of yours; and if Fortune will make that
complete, I will forgive her all her wrongs to me. "You may, indeed,"
answered she, smiling, "for your own happiness must be included in mine.
I have long known your worth; nay, I must confess," said she, blushing,
"I have long discovered that passion for me you profess, notwithstanding
those endeavours, which I am convinced were unaffected, to conceal it;
and if all I can give with reason will not suffice, take reason away;
and now I believe you cannot ask me what I will deny."--She uttered
these words with a sweetness not to be imagined. I immediately started;
my blood, which lay freezing at my heart, rushed tumultuously through
every vein. I stood for a moment silent; then, flying to her, I caught
her in my arms, no longer resisting, and softly told her she must give
me then herself. O, sir! can I describe her look? She remained silent,
and almost motionless, several minutes. At last, recovering herself a
little, she insisted on my leaving her, and in such a manner that I
instantly obeyed: you may imagine, however, I soon saw her again.--But I
ask pardon: I fear I have detained you too long in relating the
particulars of the former interview. "So far otherwise," said Adams,
licking his lips, "that I could willingly hear it over again." Well,
sir, continued the gentleman, to be as concise as possible, within a
week she consented to make me the happiest of mankind. We were married
shortly after; and when I came to examine the circumstances of my wife's
fortune (which, I do assure you, I was not presently at leisure enough
to do), I found it amounted to about six thousand pounds, most part of
which lay in effects; for her father had been a wine-merchant, and she
seemed willing, if I liked it, that I should carry on the same trade. I
readily, and too inconsiderately, undertook it; for, not having been
bred up to the secrets of the business, and endeavouring to deal with
the utmost honesty and uprightness, I soon found our fortune in a
declining way, and my trade decreasing by little and little; for my
wines, which I never adulterated after their importation, and were sold
as neat as they came over, were universally decried by the vintners, to
whom I could not allow them quite as cheap as those who gained double
the profit by a less price. I soon began to despair of improving our
fortune by these means; nor was I at all easy at the visits and
familiarity of many who had been my acquaintance in my prosperity, but
had denied and shunned me in my adversity, and now very forwardly
renewed their acquaintance with me. In short, I had sufficiently seen
that the pleasures of the world are chiefly folly, and the business of
it mostly knavery, and both nothing better than vanity; the men of
pleasure tearing one another to pieces from the emulation of spending
money, and the men of business from envy in getting it. My happiness
consisted entirely in my wife, whom I loved with an inexpressible
fondness, which was perfectly returned; and my prospects were no other
than to provide for our growing family; for she was now big of her
second child: I therefore took an opportunity to ask her opinion of
entering into a retired life, which, after hearing my reasons and
perceiving my affection for it, she readily embraced. We soon put our
small fortune, now reduced under three thousand pounds, into money, with
part of which we purchased this little place, whither we retired soon
after her delivery, from a world full of bustle, noise, hatred, envy,
and ingratitude, to ease, quiet, and love. We have here lived almost
twenty years, with little other conversation than our own, most of the
neighbourhood taking us for very strange people; the squire of the
parish representing me as a madman, and the parson as a presbyterian,
because I will not hunt with the one nor drink with the other. "Sir,"
says Adams, "Fortune hath, I think, paid you all her debts in this sweet
retirement." Sir, replied the gentleman, I am thankful to the great
Author of all things for the blessings I here enjoy. I have the best of
wives, and three pretty children, for whom I have the true tenderness of
a parent. But no blessings are pure in this world: within three years of
my arrival here I lost my eldest son. (Here he sighed bitterly.) "Sir,"
says Adams, "we must submit to Providence, and consider death as common
to all." We must submit, indeed, answered the gentleman; and if he had
died I could have borne the loss with patience; but alas! sir, he was
stolen away from my door by some wicked travelling people whom they call
gipsies; nor could I ever, with the most diligent search, recover him.
Poor child! he had the sweetest look--the exact picture of his mother;
at which some tears unwittingly dropt from his eyes, as did likewise
from those of Adams, who always sympathized with his friends on those
occasions. Thus, sir, said the gentleman, I have finished my story, in
which if I have been too particular, I ask your pardon; and now, if you
please, I will fetch you another bottle: which proposal the parson
thankfully accepted.



CHAPTER IV.

_A description of Mr Wilson's way of living. The tragical adventure of
the dog, and other grave matters._


The gentleman returned with the bottle; and Adams and he sat some time
silent, when the former started up, and cried, "No, that won't do." The
gentleman inquired into his meaning; he answered, "He had been
considering that it was possible the late famous king Theodore might
have been that very son whom he had lost;" but added, "that his age
could not answer thatequally
on both sides, and was constantly retorted with some addition, as--'I am
sure I have much more reason to say so, who am in the right.' During all
these disputes, Paul always kept strict silence, and preserved an even
countenance, without showing the least visible inclination to either
party. One day, however, when madam had left the room in a violent fury,
Lennard could not refrain from referring his cause to his friend. Was
ever anything so unreasonable, says he, as this woman? What shall I do
with her? I doat on her to distraction; nor have I any cause to complain
of, more than this obstinacy in her temper; whatever she asserts, she
will maintain against all the reason and conviction in the world. Pray
give me your advice.--First, says Paul, I will give my opinion, which
is, flatly, that you are in the wrong; for, supposing she is in the
wrong, was the subject of your contention any ways material? What
signified it whether you was married in a red or a yellow waistcoat? for
that was your dispute. Now, suppose she was mistaken; as you love her
you say so tenderly, and I believe she deserves it, would it not have
been wiser to have yielded, though you certainly knew yourself in the
right, than to give either her or yourself any uneasiness. For my own
part, if ever I marry, I am resolved to enter into an agreement with my
wife, that in all disputes (especially about trifles) that party who is
most convinced they are right shall always surrender the victory; by
which means we shall both be forward to give up the cause. I own, said
Lennard, my dear friend, shaking him by the hand, there is great truth
and reason in what you say; and I will for the future endeavour to
follow your advice. They soon after broke up the conversation, and
Lennard, going to his wife, asked her pardon, and told her his friend
had convinced him he had been in the wrong. She immediately began a vast
encomium on Paul, in which he seconded her, and both agreed he was the
worthiest and wisest man upon earth. When next they met, which was at
supper, though she had promised not to mention what her husband told
her, she could not forbear casting the kindest and most affectionate
looks on Paul, and asked him, with the sweetest voice, whether she
should help him to some potted woodcock? Potted partridge, my dear, you
mean, says the husband. My dear, says she, I ask your friend if he will
eat any potted woodcock; and I am sure I must know, who potted it. I
think I should know too, who shot them, replied the husband, and I am
convinced that I have not seen a woodcock this year; however, though I
know I am in the right, I submit, and the potted partridge is potted
woodcock if you desire to have it so. It is equal to me, says she,
whether it is one or the other; but you would persuade one out of one's
senses; to be sure, you are always in the right in your own opinion; but
your friend, I believe, knows which he is eating. Paul answered nothing,
and the dispute continued, as usual, the greatest part of the evening.
The next morning the lady, accidentally meeting Paul, and being
convinced he was her friend, and of her side, accosted him thus:--I am
certain, sir, you have long since wondered at the unreasonableness of my
husband. He is indeed, in other respects, a good sort of man, but so
positive, that no woman but one of my complying temper could possibly
live with him. Why, last night, now, was ever any creature so
unreasonable? I am certain you must condemn him. Pray, answer me, was he
not in the wrong? Paul, after a short silence, spoke as follows: I am
sorry, madam, that, as good manners obliges me to answer against my
will, so an adherence to truth forces me to declare myself of a
different opinion. To be plain and honest, you was entirely in the
wrong; the cause I own not worth disputing, but the bird was undoubtedly
a partridge. O sir! replyed the lady, I cannot possibly help your taste.
Madam, returned Paul, that is very little material; for, had it been
otherwise, a husband might have expected submission.--Indeed! sir, says
she, I assure you!--Yes, madam, cryed he, he might, from a person of
your excellent understanding; and pardon me for saying, such a
condescension would have shown a superiority of sense even to your
husband himself.--But, dear sir, said she, why should I submit when I am
in the right?--For that very reason, answered he; it would be the
greatest instance of affection imaginable; for can anything be a greater
object of our compassion than a person we love in the wrong? Ay, but I
should endeavour, said she, to set him right. Pardon me, madam, answered
Paul: I will apply to your own experience if you ever found your
arguments had that effect. The more our judgments err, the less we are
willing to own it: for my own part, I have always observed the persons
who maintain the worst side in any contest are the warmest. Why, says
she, I must confess there is truth in what you say, and I will endeavour
to practise it. The husband then coming in, Paul departed. And Leonard,
approaching his wife with an air of good humour, told her he was sorry
for their foolish dispute the last night; but he was now convinced of
his error. She answered, smiling, she believed she owed his
condescension to his complacence; that she was ashamed to think a word
had passed on so silly an occasion, especially as she was satisfyed she
had been mistaken. A little contention followed, but with the utmost
good-will to each other, and was concluded by her asserting that Paul
had thoroughly convinced her she had been in the wrong. Upon which they
both united in the praises of their common friend.

"Paul now passed his time with great satisfaction, these disputes being
much less frequent, as well as shorter than usual; but the devil, or
some unlucky accident in which perhaps the devil had no hand, shortly
put an end to his happiness. He was now eternally the private referee of
every difference; in which, after having perfectly, as he thought,
established the doctrine of submission, he never scrupled to assure both
privately that they were in the right in every argument, as before he
had followed the contrary method. One day a violent litigation happened
in his absence, and both parties agreed to refer it to his decision. The
husband professing himself sure the decision would be in his favour; the
wife answered, he might be mistaken; for she believed his friend was
convinced how seldom she was to blame; and that if he knew all--The
husband replied, My dear, I have no desire of any retrospect; but I
believe, if you knew all too, you would not imagine my friend so
entirely on your side. Nay, says she, since you provoke me, I will
mention one instance. You may remember our dispute about sending Jackey
to school in cold weather, which point I gave up to you from mere
compassion, knowing myself to be in the right; and Paul himself told me
afterwards he thought me so. My dear, replied the husband, I will not
scruple your veracity; but I assure you solemnly, on my applying to him,
he gave it absolutely on my side, and said he would have acted in the
same manner. They then proceeded to produce numberless other instances,
in all which Paul had, on vows of secresy, given his opinion on both
sides. In the conclusion, both believing each other, they fell severely
on the treachery of Paul, and agreed that he had been the occasion of
almost every dispute which had fallen out between them. They then became
extremely loving, and so full of condescension on both sides, that they
vyed with each other in censuring their own conduct, and jointly vented
their indignation on Paul, whom the wife, fearing a bloody consequence,
earnestly entreated her husband to suffer quietly to depart the next
day, which was the time fixed for his return to quarters, and then drop
his acquaintance.

"However ungenerous this behaviour in Lennard may be esteemed, his wife
obtained a promise from him (though with difficulty) to follow her
advice; but they both expressed such unusual coldness that day to Paul,
that he, who was quick of apprehension, taking Lennard aside, pressed
him so home, that he at last discovered the secret. Paul acknowledged
the truth, but told him the design with which he had done it.--To which
the other answered, he would have acted more friendly to have let him
into the whole design; for that he might have assured himself of his
secresy. Paul replyed, with some indignation, he had given him a
sufficient proof how capable he was of concealing a secret from his
wife. Lennard returned with some warmth--he had more reason to upbraid
him, for that he had caused most of the quarrels between them by his
strange conduct, and might (if they had not discovered the affair to
each other) have been the occasion of their separation. Paul then
said"--But something now happened which put a stop to Dick's reading,
and of which we shall treat in the next chapter.



CHAPTER XI.

_In which the history is continued._


Joseph Andrews had borne with great uneasiness the impertinence of beau
Didapper to Fanny, who had been talking pretty freely to her, and
offering her settlements; but the respect to the company had restrained
him from interfering whilst the beau confined himself to the use of his
tongue only; but the said beau, watching an opportunity whilst the
ladies' eyes were disposed another way, offered a rudeness to her with
his hands; which Joseph no sooner perceived than he presented him with
so sound a box on the ear, that it conveyed him several paces from where
he stood. The ladies immediately screamed out, rose from their chairs;
and the beau, as soon as he recovered himself, drew his hanger: which
Adams observing, snatched up the lid of a pot in his left hand, and,
covering himself with it as with a shield, without any weapon of offence
in his other hand, stept in before Joseph, and exposed himself to the
enraged beau, who threatened such perdition and destruction, that it
frighted the women, who were all got in a huddle together, out of their
wits, even to hear his denunciations of vengeance. Joseph was of a
different complexion, and begged Adams to let his rival come on; for he
had a good cudgel in his hand, and did not fear him. Fanny now fainted
into Mrs Adams's arms, and the whole room was in confusion, when Mr
Booby, passing by Adams, who lay snug under the pot-lid, came up to
Didapper, and insisted on his sheathing the hanger, promising he should
have satisfaction; which Joseph declared he would give him, and fight
him at any weapon whatever. The beau now sheathed his hanger, and taking
out a pocket-glass, and vowing vengeance all the time, re-adjusted his
hair; the parson deposited his shield; and Joseph, running to Fanny,
soon brought her back to life. Lady Booby chid Joseph for his insult on
Didapper; but he answered, he would have attacked an army in the same
cause. "What cause?" said the lady. "Madam," answered Joseph, "he was
rude to that young woman."--"What," says the lady, "I suppose he would
have kissed the wench; and is a gentleman to be struck for such an
offer? I must tell you, Joseph, these airs do not become you."--"Madam,"
said Mr Booby, "I saw the whole affair, and I do not commend my brother;
for I cannot perceive why he should take upon him to be this girl's
champion."--"I can commend him," says Adams: "he is a brave lad; and it
becomes any man to be the champion of the innocent; and he must be the
basest coward who would not vindicate a woman with whom he is on the
brink of marriage."--"Sir," says Mr Booby, "my brother is not a proper
match for such a young woman as this."--"No," says Lady Booby; "nor do
you, Mr Adams, act in your proper character by encouraging any such
doings; and I am very much surprized you should concern yourself in it.
I think your wife and family your properer care."--"Indeed, madam, your
ladyship says very true," answered Mrs Adams: "he talks a pack of
nonsense, that the whole parish are his children. I am sure I don't
understand what he means by it; it would make some women suspect he had
gone astray, but I acquit him of that; I can read Scripture as well as
he, and I never found that the parson was obliged to provide for other
folks' children; and besides, he is but a poor curate, and hath little
enough, as your ladyship knows, for me and mine."--"You say very well,
Mrs Adams," quoth the Lady Booby, who had not spoke a word to her before;
"you seem to be a very sensible woman; and I assure you, your husband is
acting a very foolish part, and opposing his own interest, seeing my
nephew is violently set against this match: and indeed I can't blame
him; it is by no means one suitable to our family." In this manner the
lady proceeded with Mrs Adams, whilst the beau hopped about the room,
shaking his head, partly from pain and partly from anger; and Pamela was
chiding Fanny for her assurance in aiming at such a match as her
brother. Poor Fanny answered only with her tears, which had long since
begun to wet her handkerchief; which Joseph perceiving, took her by the
arm, and wrapping it in his carried her off, swearing he would own no
relation to any one who was an enemy to her he loved more than all the
world. He went out with Fanny under his left arm, brandishing a cudgel
in his right, and neither Mr Booby nor the beau thought proper to oppose
him. Lady Booby and her company made a very short stay behind him; for
the lady's bell now summoned them to dress; for which they had just time
before dinner.

Adams seemed now very much dejected, which his wife perceiving, began to
apply some matrimonial balsam. She told him he had reason to be
concerned, for that he had probably ruined his family with his tricks
almost; but perhaps he was grieved for the loss of his two children,
Joseph and Fanny. His eldest daughter went on: "Indeed, father, it is
very hard to bring strangers here to eat your children's bread out of
their mouths. You have kept them ever since they came home; and, for
anything I see to the contrary, may keep them a month longer; are you
obliged to give her meat, tho'f she was never so handsome? But I don't
see she is so much handsomer than other people. If people were to be
kept for their beauty, she would scarce fare better than her neighbours,
I believe. As for Mr Joseph, I have nothing to say; he is a young man of
honest principles, and will pay some time or other for what he hath; but
for the girl--why doth she not return to her place she ran away from? I
would not give such a vagabond slut a halfpenny though I had a million
of money; no, though she was starving." "Indeed but I would," cries
little Dick; "and, father, rather than poor Fanny shall be starved, I
will give her all this bread and cheese"--(offering what he held in his
hand). Adams smiled on the boy, and told him he rejoiced to see he was a
Christian; and that if he had a halfpenny in his pocket, he would have
given it him; telling him it was his duty to look upon all his
neighbours as his brothers and sisters, and love them accordingly. "Yes,
papa," says he, "I love her better than my sisters, for she is handsomer
than any of them." "Is she so, saucebox?" says the sister, giving him a
box on the ear; which the father would probably have resented, had not
Joseph, Fanny, and the pedlar at that instant returned together. Adams
bid his wife prepare some food for their dinner; she said, "Truly she
could not, she had something else to do." Adams rebuked her for
disputing his commands, and quoted many texts of Scripture to prove
"That the husband is the head of the wife, and she is to submit and
obey." The wife answered, "It was blasphemy to talk Scripture out of
church; that such things were very proper to be said in the pulpit, but
that it was profane to talk them in common discourse." Joseph told Mr
Adams "He was not come with any design to give him or Mrs Adams any
trouble; but to desire the favour of all their company to the George (an
ale-house in the parish), where he had bespoke a piece of bacon and
greens for their dinner." Mrs Adams, who was a very good sort of woman,
only rather too strict in oeconomies, readily accepted this invitation,
as did the parson himself by her example; and away they all walked
together, not omitting little Dick, to whom Joseph gave a shilling when
he heard of his intended liberality to Fanny.



CHAPTER XII.

_Where the good-natured reader will see something which will give him no
great pleasure._


The pedlar had been very inquisitive from the time he had first heard
that the great house in this parish belonged to the Lady Booby, and had
learnt that she was the widow of Sir Thomas, and that Sir Thomas had
bought Fanny, at about the age of three or four years, of a travelling
woman; and, now their homely but hearty meal was ended, he told Fanny
he believed he could acquaint her with her parents. The whole company,
especially she herself, started at this offer of the pedlar's. He then
proceeded thus, while they all lent their strictest attention:--"Though
I am now contented with this humble way of getting my livelihood, I was
formerly a gentleman; for so all those of my profession are called. In
a word, I was a drummer in an Irish regiment of foot. Whilst I was in
this honourable station I attended an officer of our regiment into
England a-recruiting. In our march from Bristol to Froome (for since
the decay of the woollen trade the clothing towns have furnished the
army with a great number of recruits) we overtook on the road a woman,
who seemed to be about thirty years old or thereabouts, not very
handsome, but well enough for a soldier. As we came up to her, she
mended her pace, and falling into discourse with our ladies (for every
man of the party, namely, a serjeant, two private men, and a drum, were
provided with their woman except myself), she continued to travel on
with us. I, perceiving she must fall to my lot, advanced presently to
her, made love to her in our military way, and quickly succeeded to my
wishes. We struck a bargain within a mile, and lived together as man
and wife to her dying day." "I suppose," says Adams, interrupting him,
"you were married with a licence; for I don't see how you could
contrive to have the banns published while you were marching from place
to place." "No, sir," said the pedlar, "we took a licence to go to bed
together without any banns." "Ay! ay!" said the parson; "_ex
necessitate_, a licence may be allowable enough; but surely, surely,
the other is the more regular and eligible way." The pedlar proceeded
thus: "She returned with me to our regiment, and removed with us from
quarters to quarters, till at last, whilst we lay at Galloway, she fell
ill of a fever and died. When she was on her death-bed she called me to
her, and, crying bitterly, declared she could not depart this world
without discovering a secret to me, which, she said, was the only sin
which sat heavy on her heart. She said she had formerly travelled in a
company of gypsies, who had made a practice of stealing away children;
that for her own part, she had been only once guilty of the crime;
which, she said, she lamented more than all the rest of her sins, since
probably it might have occasioned the death of the parents; for, added
she, it is almost impossible to describe the beauty of the young
creature, which was about a year and a half old when I kidnapped it. We
kept her (for she was a girl) above two years in our company, when I
sold her myself, for three guineas, to Sir Thomas Booby, in
Somersetshire. Now, you know whether there are any more of that name in
this county." "Yes," says Adams, "there are several Boobys who are
squires, but I believe no baronet now alive; besides, it answers so
exactly in every point, there is no room for doubt; but you have forgot
to tell us the parents from whom the child was stolen." "Their name,"
answered the pedlar, "was Andrews. They lived about thirty miles from
the squire; and she told me that I might be sure to find them out by
one circumstance; for that they had a daughter of a very strange name,
Pamela, or Pam_e_la; some pronounced it one way, and some the other."
Fanny, who had changed colour at the first mention of the name, now
fainted away; Joseph turned pale, and poor Dicky began to roar; the
parson fell on his knees, and ejaculated many thanksgivings that this
discovery had been made before the dreadful sin of incest was
committed; and the pedlar was struck with amazement, not being able to
account for all this confusion; the cause of which was presently opened
by the parson's daughter, who was the only unconcerned person (for the
mother was chafing Fanny's temples, and taking the utmost care of her):
and, indeed, Fanny was the only creature whom the daughter would not
have pitied in her situation; wherein, though we compassionate her
ourselves, we shall leave her for a little while, and pay a short visit
to Lady Booby.



CHAPTER XIII.

_The history, returning to the Lady Booby, gives some account of the
terrible conflict in her breast between love and pride; with what
happened on the present discovery._


The lady sat down with her company to dinner, but eat nothing. As soon
as her cloth was removed she whispered Pamela that she was taken a
little ill, and desired her to entertain her husband and beau Didapper.
She then went up into her chamber, sent for Slipslop, threw herself on
the bed in the agonies of love, rage, and despair; nor could she conceal
these boiling passions longer without bursting. Slipslop now approached
her bed, and asked how her ladyship did; but, instead of revealing her
disorder, as she intended, she entered into a long encomium on the
beauty and virtues of Joseph Andrews; ending, at last, with expressing
her concern that so much tenderness should be thrown away on so
despicable an object as Fanny. Slipslop, well knowing how to humour her
mistress's frenzy, proceeded to repeat, with exaggeration, if possible,
all her mistress had said, and concluded with a wish that Joseph had
been a gentleman, and that she could see her lady in the arms of such a
husband. The lady then started from the bed, and, taking a turn or two
across the room, cryed out, with a deep sigh, "Sure he would make any
woman happy!"--"Your ladyship," says she, "would be the happiest woman
in the world with him. A fig for custom and nonsense! What 'vails what
people say? Shall I be afraid of eating sweetmeats because people may
say I have a sweet tooth? If I had a mind to marry a man, all the world
should not hinder me. Your ladyship hath no parents to tutelar your
infections; besides, he is of your ladyship's family now, and as good a
gentleman as any in the country; and why should not a woman follow her
mind as well as man? Why should not your ladyship marry the brother as
well as your nephew the sister. I am sure, if it was a fragrant crime, I
would not persuade your ladyship to it."--"But, dear Slipslop," answered
the lady, "if I could prevail on myself to commit such a weakness, there
is that cursed Fanny in the way, whom the idiot--O how I hate and
despise him!"--"She! a little ugly mynx," cries Slipslop; "leave her to
me. I suppose your ladyship hath heard of Joseph's fitting with one of
Mr Didapper's servants about her; and his master hath ordered them to
carry her away by force this evening. I'll take care they shall not want
assistance. I was talking with this gentleman, who was below, just when
your ladyship sent for me."--"Go back," says the Lady Booby, "this
instant, for I expect Mr Didapper will soon be going. Do all you can;
for I am resolved this wench shall not be in our family: I will
endeavour to return to the company; but let me know as soon as she is
carried off." Slipslop went away; and her mistress began to arraign her
own conduct in the following manner:--

"What am I doing? How do I suffer this passion to creep imperceptibly
upon me? How many days are past since I could have submitted to ask
myself the question?--Marry a footman! Distraction! Can I afterwards
bear the eyes of my acquaintance? But I can retire from them; retire
with one in whom I propose more happiness than the world without him
can give me! Retire-to feed continually on beauties which my inflamed
imagination sickens with eagerly gazing on; to satisfy every appetite,
every desire, with their utmost wish. Ha! and do I doat thus on a
footman? I despise, I detest my passion.--Yet why? Is he not generous,
gentle, kind?--Kind! to whom? to the meanest wretch, a creature below my
consideration. Doth he not--yes, he doth prefer her. Curse his beauties,
and the little low heart that possesses them; which can basely descend
to this despicable wench, and be ungratefully deaf to all the honours I
do him. And can I then love this monster? No, I will tear his image from
my bosom, tread on him, spurn him. I will have those pitiful charms,
which now I despise, mangled in my sight; for I will not suffer the
little jade I hate to riot in the beauties I contemn. No; though I
despise him myself, though I would spurn him from my feet, was he to
languish at them, no other should taste the happiness I scorn. Why do I
say happiness? To me it would be misery. To sacrifice my reputation, my
character, my rank in life, to the indulgence of a mean and a vile
appetite! How I detest the thought! How much more exquisite is the
pleasure resulting from the reflection of virtue and prudence than the
faint relish of what flows from vice and folly! Whither did I suffer
this improper, this mad passion to hurry me, only by neglecting to
summon the aids of reason to my assistance? Reason, which hath now set
before me my desires in their proper colours, and immediately helped me
to expel them. Yes, I thank Heaven and my pride, I have now perfectly
conquered this unworthy passion; and if there was no obstacle in its
way, my pride would disdain any pleasures which could be the consequence
of so base, so mean, so vulgar--" Slipslop returned at this instant in a
violent hurry, and with the utmost eagerness cryed out, "O madam! I have
strange news. Tom the footman is just come from the George; where, it
seems, Joseph and the rest of them are a jinketting; and he says there
is a strange man who hath discovered that Fanny and Joseph are brother
and sister."--"How, Slipslop?" cries the lady, in a surprize.--"I had
not time, madam," cries Slipslop, "to enquire about particles, but Tom
says it is most certainly true."

This unexpected account entirely obliterated all those admirable
reflections which the supreme power of reason had so wisely made just
before. In short, when despair, which had more share in producing the
resolutions of hatred we have seen taken, began to retreat, the lady
hesitated a moment, and then, forgetting all the purport of her
soliloquy, dismissed her woman again, with orders to bid Tom attend her
in the parlour, whither she now hastened to acquaint Pamela with the
news. Pamela said she could not believe it; for she had never heard that
her mother had lost any child, or that she had ever had any more than
Joseph and herself. The lady flew into a violent rage with her, and
talked of upstarts and disowning relations who had so lately been on a
level with her. Pamela made no answer; but her husband, taking up her
cause, severely reprimanded his aunt for her behaviour to his wife: he
told her, if it had been earlier in the evening she should not have
staid a moment longer in her house; that he was convinced, if this young
woman could be proved her sister, she would readily embrace her as such,
and he himself would do the same. He then desired the fellow might be
sent for, and the young woman with him, which Lady Booby immediately
ordered; and, thinking proper to make some apology to Pamela for what
she had said, it was readily accepted, and all things reconciled.

The pedlar now attended, as did Fanny and Joseph, who would not quit
her; the parson likewise was induced, not only by curiosity, of which he
had no small portion, but his duty, as he apprehended it, to follow
them; for he continued all the way to exhort them, who were now breaking
their hearts, to offer up thanksgivings, and be joyful for so miraculous
an escape.

When they arrived at Booby-Hall they were presently called into the
parlour, where the pedlar repeated the same story he had told before,
and insisted on the truth of every circumstance; so that all who heard
him were extremely well satisfied of the truth, except Pamela, who
imagined, as she had never heard either of her parents mention such an
accident, that it must be certainly false; and except the Lady Booby,
who suspected the falsehood of the story from her ardent desire that it
should be true; and Joseph, who feared its truth, from his earnest
wishes that it might prove false.

Mr Booby now desired them all to suspend their curiosity and absolute
belief or disbelief till the next morning, when he expected old Mr
Andrews and his wife to fetch himself and Pamela home in his coach, and
then they might be certain of certainly knowing the truth or falsehood
of this relation; in which, he said, as there were many strong
circumstances to induce their credit, so he could not perceive any
interest the pedlar could have in inventing it, or in endeavouring to
impose such a falsehood on them.

The Lady Booby, who was very little used to such company, entertained
them all--_viz_. her nephew, his wife, her brother and sister, the beau,
and the parson, with great good humour at her own table. As to the
pedlar, she ordered him to be made as welcome as possible by her
servants. All the company in the parlour, except the disappointed
lovers, who sat sullen and silent, were full of mirth; for Mr Booby had
prevailed on Joseph to ask Mr Didapper's pardon, with which he was
perfectly satisfied. Many jokes passed between the beau and the parson,
chiefly on each other's dress; these afforded much diversion to the
company. Pamela chid her brother Joseph for the concern which he exprest
at discovering a new sister. She said, if he loved Fanny as he ought,
with a pure affection, he had no reason to lament being related to
her.--Upon which Adams began to discourse on Platonic love; whence he
made a quick transition to the joys in the next world, and concluded
with strongly asserting that there was no such thing as pleasure in
this. At which Pamela and her husband smiled on one another.

This happy pair proposing to retire (for no other person gave the least
symptom of desiring rest), they all repaired to several beds provided
for them in the same house; nor was Adams himself suffered to go home,
it being a stormy night. Fanny indeed often begged she might go home
with the parson; but her stay was so strongly insisted on, that she at
last, by Joseph's advice, consented.



CHAPTER XIV.

_Containing several curious night-adventures, in which Mr Adams fell
into many hair-breadth 'scapes, partly owing to his goodness, and partly
to his inadvertency._


About an hour after they had all separated (it being now past three in
the morning), beau Didapper, whose passion for Fanny permitted him not
to close his eyes, but had employed his imagination in contrivances how
to satisfy his desires, at last hit on a method by which he hoped to
effect it. He had ordered his servant to bring him word where Fanny lay,
and had received his information; he therefore arose, put on his
breeches and nightgown, and stole softly along the gallery which led to
her apartment; and, being come to the door, as he imagined it, he opened
it with the least noise possible and entered the chamber. A savour now
invaded his nostrils which he did not expect in the room of so sweet a
young creature, and which might have probably had no good effect on a
cooler lover. However, he groped out the bed with difficulty, for there
was not a glimpse of light, and, opening the curtains, he whispered in
Joseph's voice (for he was an excellent mimic), "Fanny, my angel! I am
come to inform thee that I have discovered the falsehood of the story we
last night heard. I am no longer thy brother, but the lover; nor will I
be delayed the enjoyment of thee one moment longer. You have sufficient
assurances of my constancy not to doubt my marrying you, and it would be
want of love to deny me the possession of thy charms."--So saying, he
disencumbered himself from the little clothes he had on, and, leaping
into bed, embraced his angel, as he conceived her, with great rapture.
If he was surprized at receiving no answer, he was no less pleased to
find his hug returned with equal ardour. He remained not long in this
sweet confusion; for both he and his paramour presently discovered their
error. Indeed it was no other than the accomplished Slipslop whom he had
engaged; but, though she immediately knew the person whom she had
mistaken for Joseph, he was at a loss to guess at the representative of
Fanny. He had so little seen or taken notice of this gentlewoman, that
light itself would have afforded him no assistance in his conjecture.
Beau Didapper no sooner had perceived his mistake than he attempted to
escape from the bed with much greater haste than he had made to it; but
the watchful Slipslop prevented him. For that prudent woman, being
disappointed of those delicious offerings which her fancy had promised
her pleasure, resolved to make an immediate sacrifice to her virtue.
Indeed she wanted an opportunity to heal some wounds, which her late
conduct had, she feared, given her reputation; and, as she had a
wonderful presence of mind, she conceived the person of the unfortunate
beau to be luckily thrown in her way to restore her lady's opinion of
her impregnable chastity. At that instant, therefore, when he offered to
leap from the bed, she caught fast hold of his shirt, at the same time
roaring out, "O thou villain! who hast attacked my chastity, and, I
believe, ruined me in my sleep; I will swear a rape against thee, I will
prosecute thee with the utmost vengeance." The beau attempted to get
loose, but she held him fast, and when he struggled she cried out
"Murder! murder! rape! robbery! ruin!" At which words, parson Adams, who
lay in the next chamber, wakeful, and meditating on the pedlar's
discovery, jumped out of bed, and, without staying to put a rag of
clothes on, hastened into the apartment whence the cries proceeded. He
made directly to the bed in the dark, where, laying hold of the beau's
skin (for Slipslop had torn his shirt almost off), and finding his skin
extremely soft, and hearing him in a low voice begging Slipslop to let
him go, he no longer doubted but this was the young woman in danger of
ravishing, and immediately falling on the bed, and laying hold on
Slipslop's chin, where he found a rough beard, his belief was confirmed;
he therefore rescued the beau, who presently made his escape, and then,
turning towards Slipslop, received such a cuff on his chops, that, his
wrath kindling instantly, he offered to return the favour so stoutly,
that had poor Slipslop received the fist, which in the dark passed by
her and fell on the pillow, she would most probably have given up the
ghost. Adams, missing his blow, fell directly on Slipslop, who cuffed
and scratched as well as she could; nor was he behindhand with her in
his endeavours, but happily the darkness of the night befriended her.
She then cried she was a woman; but Adams answered, she was rather the
devil, and if she was he would grapple with him; and, being again
irritated by another stroke on his chops, he gave her such a remembrance
in the guts, that she began to roar loud enough to be heard all over the
house. Adams then, seizing her by the hair (for her double-clout had
fallen off in the scuffle), pinned her head down to the bolster, and
then both called for lights together. The Lady Booby, who was as wakeful
as any of her guests, had been alarmed from the beginning; and, being a
woman of a bold spirit, she slipt on a nightgown, petticoat, and
slippers, and taking a candle, which always burnt in her chamber, in her
hand, she walked undauntedly to Slipslop's room; where she entered just
at the instant as Adams had discovered, by the two mountains which
Slipslop carried before her, that he was concerned with a female. He
then concluded her to be a witch, and said he fancied those breasts gave
suck to a legion of devils. Slipslop, seeing Lady Booby enter the room,
cried help! or I am ravished, with a most audible voice: and Adams,
perceiving the light, turned hastily, and saw the lady (as she did him)
just as she came to the feet of the bed; nor did her modesty, when she
found the naked condition of Adams, suffer her to approach farther. She
then began to revile the parson as the wickedest of all men, and
particularly railed at his impudence in chusing her house for the scene
of his debaucheries, and her own woman for the object of his bestiality.
Poor Adams had before discovered the countenance of his bedfellow, and,
now first recollecting he was naked, he was no less confounded than Lady
Booby herself, and immediately whipt under the bedclothes, whence the
chaste Slipslop endeavoured in vain to shut him out. Then putting forth
his head, on which, by way of ornament, he wore a flannel nightcap, he
protested his innocence, and asked ten thousand pardons of Mrs Slipslop
for the blows he had struck her, vowing he had mistaken her for a witch.
Lady Booby, then casting her eyes on the ground, observed something
sparkle with great lustre, which, when she had taken it up, appeared to
be a very fine pair of diamond buttons for the sleeves. A little farther
she saw lie the sleeve itself of a shirt with laced ruffles. "Heyday!"
says she, "what is the meaning of this?" "O, madam," says Slipslop, "I
don't know what hath happened, I have been so terrified. Here may have
been a dozen men in the room." "To whom belongs this laced shirt and
jewels?" says the lady. "Undoubtedly," cries the parson, "to the young
gentleman whom I mistook for a woman on coming into the room, whence
proceeded all the subsequent mistakes; for if I had suspected him for a
man, I would have seized him, had he been another Hercules, though,
indeed, he seems rather to resemble Hylas." He then gave an account of
the reason of his rising from bed, and the rest, till the lady came into
the room; at which, and the figures of Slipslop and her gallant, whose
heads only were visible at the opposite corners of the bed, she could
not refrain from laughter; nor did Slipslop persist in accusing the
parson of any motions towards a rape. The lady therefore desired him to
return to his bed as soon as she was departed, and then ordering
Slipslop to rise and attend her in her own room, she returned herself
thither. When she was gone, Adams renewed his petitions for pardon to
Mrs Slipslop, who, with a most Christian temper, not only forgave, but
began to move with much courtesy towards him, which he taking as a hint
to begin, immediately quitted the bed, and made the best of his way
towards his own; but unluckily, instead of turning to the right, he
turned to the left, and went to the apartment where Fanny lay, who (as
the reader may remember) had not slept a wink the preceding night, and
who was so hagged out with what had happened to her in the day, that,
notwithstanding all thoughts of her Joseph, she was fallen into so
profound a sleep, that all the noise in the adjoining room had not been
able to disturb her. Adams groped out the bed, and, turning the clothes
down softly, a custom Mrs Adams had long accustomed him to, crept in,
and deposited his carcase on the bed-post, a place which that good woman
had always assigned him.

As the cat or lap-dog of some lovely nymph, for whom ten thousand lovers
languish, lies quietly by the side of the charming maid, and, ignorant
of the scene of delight on which they repose, meditates the future
capture of a mouse, or surprisal of a plate of bread and butter: so
Adams lay by the side of Fanny, ignorant of the paradise to which he was
so near; nor could the emanation of sweets which flowed from her breath
overpower the fumes of tobacco which played in the parson's nostrils.
And now sleep had not overtaken the good man, when Joseph, who had
secretly appointed Fanny to come to her at the break of day, rapped
softly at the chamber-door, which when he had repeated twice, Adams
cryed, "Come in, whoever you are." Joseph thought he had mistaken the
door, though she had given him the most exact directions; however,
knowing his friend's voice, he opened it, and saw some female vestments
lying on a chair. Fanny waking at the same instant, and stretching out
her hand on Adams's beard, she cried out,--"O heavens! where am I?"
"Bless me! where am I?" said the parson. Then Fanny screamed, Adams
leapt out of bed, and Joseph stood, as the tragedians call it, like the
statue of Surprize. "How came she into my room?" cryed Adams. "How came
you into hers?" cryed Joseph, in an astonishment. "I know nothing of the
matter," answered Adams, "but that she is a vestal for me. As I am a
Christian, I know not whether she is a man or woman. He is an infidel
who doth not believe in witchcraft. They as surely exist now as in the
days of Saul. My clothes are bewitched away too, and Fanny's brought
into their place." For he still insisted he was in his own apartment;
but Fanny denied it vehemently, and said his attempting to persuade
Joseph of such a falsehood convinced her of his wicked designs. "How!"
said Joseph in a rage, "hath he offered any rudeness to you?" She
answered--She could not accuse him of any more than villanously stealing
to bed to her, which she thought rudeness sufficient, and what no man
would do without a wicked intention.

Joseph's great opinion of Adams was not easily to be staggered, and when
he heard from Fanny that no harm had happened he grew a little cooler;
yet still he was confounded, and, as he knew the house, and that the
women's apartments were on this side Mrs Slipslop's room, and the men's
on the other, he was convinced that he was in Fanny's chamber. Assuring
Adams therefore of this truth, he begged him to give some account how he
came there. Adams then, standing in his shirt, which did not offend
Fanny, as the curtains of the bed were drawn, related all that had
happened; and when he had ended Joseph told him,--It was plain he had
mistaken by turning to the right instead of the left. "Odso!" cries
Adams, "that's true: as sure as sixpence, you have hit on the very
thing." He then traversed the room, rubbing his hands, and begged
Fanny's pardon, assuring her he did not know whether she was man or
woman. That innocent creature firmly believing all he said, told him she
was no longer angry, and begged Joseph to conduct him into his own
apartment, where he should stay himself till she had put her clothes on.
Joseph and Adams accordingly departed, and the latter soon was convinced
of the mistake he had committed; however, whilst he was dressing
himself, he often asserted he believed in the power of witchcraft
notwithstanding, and did not see how a Christian could deny it.



CHAPTER XV.

_The arrival of Gaffar and Gammar Andrews, with another person not
much expected; and a perfect solution of the difficulties raised by
the pedlar._


As soon as Fanny was drest Joseph returned to her, and they had a long
conversation together, the conclusion of which was, that, if they found
themselves to be really brother and sister, they vowed a perpetual
celibacy, and to live together all their days, and indulge a Platonic
friendship for each other.

The company were all very merry at breakfast, and Joseph and Fanny
rather more chearful than the preceding night. The Lady Booby produced
the diamond button, which the beau most readily owned, and alledged that
he was very subject to walk in his sleep. Indeed, he was far from being
ashamed of his amour, and rather endeavoured to insinuate that more than
was really true had passed between him and the fair Slipslop.

Their tea was scarce over when news came of the arrival of old Mr
Andrews and his wife. They were immediately introduced, and kindly
received by the Lady Booby, whose heart went now pit-a-pat, as did those
of Joseph and Fanny. They felt, perhaps, little less anxiety in this
interval than Oedipus himself, whilst his fate was revealing.

Mr Booby first opened the cause by informing the old gentleman that he
had a child in the company more than he knew of, and, taking Fanny by
the hand, told him, this was that daughter of his who had been stolen
away by gypsies in her infancy. Mr Andrews, after expressing some
astonishment, assured his honour that he had never lost a daughter by
gypsies, nor ever had any other children than Joseph and Pamela. These
words were a cordial to the two lovers; but had a different effect on
Lady Booby. She ordered the pedlar to be called, who recounted his story
as he had done before.--At the end of which, old Mrs Andrews, running to
Fanny, embraced her, crying out, "She is, she is my child!" The company
were all amazed at this disagreement between the man and his wife; and
the blood had now forsaken the cheeks of the lovers, when the old woman,
turning to her husband, who was more surprized than all the rest, and
having a little recovered her own spirits, delivered herself as follows:
"You may remember, my dear, when you went a serjeant to Gibraltar, you
left me big with child; you stayed abroad, you know, upwards of three
years. In your absence I was brought to bed, I verily believe, of this
daughter, whom I am sure I have reason to remember, for I suckled her at
this very breast till the day she was stolen from me. One afternoon,
when the child was about a year, or a year and a half old, or
thereabouts, two gypsy-women came to the door and offered to tell my
fortune. One of them had a child in her lap. I showed them my hand, and
desired to know if you was ever to come home again, which I remember as
well as if it was but yesterday: they faithfully promised me you
should.--I left the girl in the cradle and went to draw them a cup of
liquor, the best I had: when I returned with the pot (I am sure I was
not absent longer than whilst I am telling it to you) the women were
gone. I was afraid they had stolen something, and looked and looked, but
to no purpose, and, Heaven knows, I had very little for them to steal.
At last, hearing the child cry in the cradle, I went to take it up--but,
O the living! how was I surprized to find, instead of my own girl that I
had put into the cradle, who was as fine a fat thriving child as you
shall see in a summer's day, a poor sickly boy, that did not seem to
have an hour to live. I ran out, pulling my hair off and crying like any
mad after the women, but never could hear a word of them from that day
to this. When I came back the poor infant (which is our Joseph there, as
stout as he now stands) lifted up its eyes upon me so piteously, that,
to be sure, notwithstanding my passion, I could not find in my heart to
do it any mischief. A neighbour of mine, happening to come in at the
same time, and hearing the case, advised me to take care of this poor
child, and God would perhaps one day restore me my own. Upon which I
took the child up, and suckled it to be sure, all the world as if it had
been born of my own natural body; and as true as I am alive, in a little
time I loved the boy all to nothing as if it had been my own
girl.--Well, as I was saying, times growing very hard, I having two
children and nothing but my own work, which was little enough, God
knows, to maintain them, was obliged to ask relief of the parish; but,
instead of giving it me, they removed me, by justices' warrants, fifteen
miles, to the place where I now live, where I had not been long settled
before you came home. Joseph (for that was the name I gave him
myself--the Lord knows whether he was baptized or no, or by what name),
Joseph, I say, seemed to me about five years old when you returned; for
I believe he is two or three years older than our daughter here (for I
am thoroughly convinced she is the same); and when you saw him you said
he was a chopping boy, without ever minding his age; and so I, seeing
you did not suspect anything of the matter, thought I might e'en as well
keep it to myself, for fear you should not love him as well as I did.
And all this is veritably true, and I will take my oath of it before any
justice in the kingdom."

The pedlar, who had been summoned by the order of Lady Booby, listened
with the utmost attention to Gammar Andrews's story; and, when she had
finished, asked her if the supposititious child had no mark on its
breast? To which she answered, "Yes, he had as fine a strawberry as ever
grew in a garden." This Joseph acknowledged, and, unbuttoning his coat,
at the intercession of the company, showed to them. "Well," says Gaffar
Andrews, who was a comical sly old fellow, and very likely desired to
have no more children than he could keep, "you have proved, I think,
very plainly, that this boy doth not belong to us; but how are you
certain that the girl is ours?" The parson then brought the pedlar
forward, and desired him to repeat the story which he had communicated
to him the preceding day at the ale-house; which he complied with, and
related what the reader, as well as Mr Adams, hath seen before. He then
confirmed, from his wife's report, all the circumstances of the
exchange, and of the strawberry on Joseph's breast. At the repetition of
the word strawberry, Adams, who had seen it without any emotion, started
and cried, "Bless me! something comes into my head." But before he had
time to bring anything out a servant called him forth. When he was gone
the pedlar assured Joseph that his parents were persons of much greater
circumstances than those he had hitherto mistaken for such; for that he
had been stolen from a gentleman's house by those whom they calnce in its fable and action, in this; that as in the one these are
grave and solemn, so in the other they are light and ridiculous: it
differs in its characters by introducing persons of inferior rank, and
consequently, of inferior manners, whereas the grave romance sets the
highest before us: lastly, in its sentiments and diction; by preserving
the ludicrous instead of the sublime. In the diction, I think,
burlesque itself may be sometimes admitted; of which many instances
will occur in this work, as in the description of the battles, and some
other places, not necessary to be pointed out to the classical reader,
for whose entertainment those parodies or burlesque imitations are
chiefly calculated.

But though we have sometimes admitted this in our diction, we have
carefully excluded it from our sentiments and characters; for there it
is never properly introduced, unless in writings of the burlesque kind,
which this is not intended to be. Indeed, no two species of writing can
differ more widely than the comic and the burlesque; for as the latter
is ever the exhibition of what is monstrous and unnatural, and where our
delight, if we examine it, arises from the surprizing absurdity, as in
appropriating the manners of the highest to the lowest, or _e converso_;
so in the former we should ever confine ourselves strictly to nature,
from the just imitation of which will flow all the pleasure we can this
way convey to a sensible reader. And perhaps there is one reason why a
comic writer should of all others be the least excused for deviating
from nature, since it may not be always so easy for a serious poet to
meet with the great and the admirable; but life everywhere furnishes an
accurate observer with the ridiculous.

I have hinted this little concerning burlesque, because I have often
heard that name given to performances which have been truly of the comic
kind, from the author's having sometimes admitted it in his diction
only; which, as it is the dress of poetry, doth, like the dress of men,
establish characters (the one of the whole poem, and the other of the
whole man), in vulgar opinion, beyond any of their greater excellences:
but surely, a certain drollery in stile, where characters and sentiments
are perfectly natural, no more constitutes the burlesque, than an empty
pomp and dignity of words, where everything else is mean and low, can
entitle any performance to the appellation of the true sublime.

And I apprehend my Lord Shaftesbury's opinion of mere burlesque agrees
with mine, when he asserts, There is no such thing to be found in the
writings of the ancients. But perhaps I have less abhorrence than he
professes for it; and that, not because I have had some little success
on the stage this way, but rather as it contributes more to exquisite
mirth and laughter than any other; and these are probably more wholesome
physic for the mind, and conduce better to purge away spleen,
melancholy, and ill affections, than is generally imagined. Nay, I will
appeal to common observation, whether the same companies are not found
more full of good-humour and benevolence, after they have been sweetened
for two or three hours with entertainments of this kind, than when
soured by a tragedy or a grave lecture.

But to illustrate all this by another science, in which, perhaps, we
shall see the distinction more clearly and plainly, let us examine the
works of a comic history painter, with those performances which the
Italians call Caricatura, where we shall find the true excellence of the
former to consist in the exactest copying of nature; insomuch that a
judicious eye instantly rejects anything _outre_, any liberty which the
painter hath taken with the features of that _alma mater_; whereas in
the Caricatura we allow all licence--its aim is to exhibit monsters,
not men; and all distortions and exaggerations whatever are within its
proper province.

Now, what Caricatura is in painting, Burlesque is in writing; and in the
same manner the comic writer and painter correlate to each other. And
here I shall observe, that, as in the former the painter seems to have
the advantage; so it is in the latter infinitely on the side of the
writer; for the Monstrous is much easier to paint than describe, and the
Ridiculous to describe than paint.

And though perhaps this latter species doth not in either science so
strongly affect and agitate the muscles as the other; yet it will be
owned, I believe, that a more rational and useful pleasure arises to us
from it. He who should call the ingenious Hogarth a burlesque painter,
would, in my opinion, do him very little honour; for sure it is much
easier, much less the subject of admiration, to paint a man with a nose,
or any other feature, of a preposterous size, or to expose him in some
absurd or monstrous attitude, than to express the affections of men on
canvas. It hath been thought a vast commendation of a painter to say his
figures seem to breathe; but surely it is a much greater and nobler
applause, that they appear to think.

But to return. The Ridiculous only, as I have before said, falls within
my province in the present work. Nor will some explanation of this word
be thought impertinent by the reader, if he considers how wonderfully it
hath been mistaken, even by writers who have professed it: for to what
but such a mistake can we attribute the many attempts to ridicule the
blackest villanies, and, what is yet worse, the most dreadful
calamities? What could exceed the absurdity of an author, who should
write the comedy of Nero, with the merry incident of ripping up his
mother's belly? or what would give a greater shock to humanity than an
attempt to expose the miseries of poverty and distress to ridicule? And
yet the reader will not want much learning to suggest such instances
to himself.

Besides, it may seem remarkable, that Aristotle, who is so fond and free
of definitions, hath not thought proper to define the Ridiculous.
Indeed, where he tells us it is proper to comedy, he hath remarked that
villany is not its object: but he hath not, as I remember, positively
asserted what is. Nor doth the Abbe Bellegarde, who hath written a
treatise on this subject, though he shows us many species of it, once
trace it to its fountain.

The only source of the true Ridiculous (as it appears to me) is
affectation. But though it arises from one spring only, when we consider
the infinite streams into which this one branches, we shall presently
cease to admire at the copious field it affords to an observer. Now,
affectation proceeds from one of these two causes, vanity or hypocrisy:
for as vanity puts us on affecting false characters, in order to
purchase applause; so hypocrisy sets us on an endeavour to avoid
censure, by concealing our vices under an appearance of their opposite
virtues. And though these two causes are often confounded (for there is
some difficulty in distinguishing them), yet, as they proceed from very
different motives, so they are as clearly distinct in their operations:
for indeed, the affectation which arises from vanity is nearer to truth
than the other, as it hath not that violent repugnancy of nature to
struggle with, which that of the hypocrite hath. It may be likewise
noted, that affectation doth not imply an absolute negation of those
qualities which are affected; and, therefore, though, when it proceeds
from hypocrisy, it be nearly allied to deceit; yet when it comes from
vanity only, it partakes of the nature of ostentation: for instance, the
affectation of liberality in a vain man differs visibly from the same
affectation in the avaricious; for though the vain man is not what he
would appear, or hath not the virtue he affects, to the degree he would
be thought to have it; yet it sits less awkwardly on him than on the
avaricious man, who is the very reverse of what he would seem to be.

From the discovery of this affectation arises the Ridiculous, which
always strikes the reader with surprize and pleasure; and that in a
higher and stronger degree when the affectation arises from hypocrisy,
than when from vanity; for to discover any one to be the exact reverse
of what he affects, is more surprizing, and consequently more
ridiculous, than to find him a little deficient in the quality he
desires the reputation of. I might observe that our Ben Jonson, who of
all men understood the Ridiculous the best, hath chiefly used the
hypocritical affectation.

Now, from affectation only, the misfortunes and calamities of life, or
the imperfections of nature, may become the objects of ridicule. Surely
he hath a very ill-framed mind who can look on ugliness, infirmity, or
poverty, as ridiculous in themselves: nor do I believe any man living,
who meets a dirty fellow riding through the streets in a cart, is
struck with an idea of the Ridiculous from it; but if he should see the
same figure descend from his coach and six, or bolt from his chair with
his hat under his arm, he would then begin to laugh, and with justice.
In the same manner, were we to enter a poor house and behold a wretched
family shivering with cold and languishing with hunger, it would not
incline us to laughter (at least we must have very diabolical natures if
it would); but should we discover there a grate, instead of coals,
adorned with flowers, empty plate or china dishes on the sideboard, or
any other affectation of riches and finery, either on their persons or
in their furniture, we might then indeed be excused for ridiculing so
fantastical an appearance. Much less are natural imperfections the
object of derision; but when ugliness aims at the applause of beauty, or
lameness endeavours to display agility, it is then that these
unfortunate circumstances, which at first moved our compassion, tend
only to raise our mirth.

The poet carries this very far:--

    None are for being what they are in fault,
    But for not being what they would be thought.

Where if the metre would suffer the word Ridiculous to close the first
line, the thought would be rather more proper. Great vices are the
proper objects of our detestation, smaller faults, of our pity; but
affectation appears to me the only true source of the Ridiculous.

But perhaps it may be objected to me, that I have against my own rules
introduced vices, and of a very black kind, into this work. To which I
shall answer: first, that it is very difficult to pursue a series of
human actions, and keep clear from them. Secondly, that the vices to be
found here are rather the accidental consequences of some human frailty
or foible, than causes habitually existing in the mind. Thirdly, that
they are never set forth as the objects of ridicule, but detestation.
Fourthly, that they are never the principal figure at that time on the
scene: and, lastly, they never produce the intended evil.

Having thus distinguished Joseph Andrews from the productions of romance
writers on the one hand and burlesque writers on the other, and given
some few very short hints (for I intended no more) of this species of
writing, which I have affirmed to be hitherto unattempted in our
language; I shall leave to my good-natured reader to apply my piece to
my observations, and will detain him no longer than with a word
concerning the characters in this work.

And here I solemnly protest I have no intention to vilify or asperse any
one; for though everything is copied from the book of nature, and scarce
a character or action produced which I have not taken from my I own
observations and experience; yet I have used the utmost care to obscure
the persons by such different circumstances, degrees, and colours, that
it will be impossible to guess at them with any degree of certainty; and
if it ever happens otherwise, it is only where the failure characterized
is so minute, that it is a foible only which the party himself may laugh
at as well as any other.

As to the character of Adams, as it is the most glaring in the whole, so
I conceive it is not to be found in any book now extant. It is designed
a character of perfect simplicity; and as the goodness of his heart
will recommend him to the good-natured, so I hope it will excuse me to
the gentlemen of his cloth; for whom, while they are worthy of their
sacred order, no man can possibly have a greater respect. They will
therefore excuse me, notwithstanding the low adventures in which he is
engaged, that I have made him a clergyman; since no other office could
have given him so many opportunities of displaying his worthy
inclinations.




THE HISTORY OF THE ADVENTURES OF JOSEPH ANDREWS AND HIS FRIEND MR
ABRAHAM ADAMS




BOOK I.



CHAPTER I.

_Of writing lives in general, and particularly of Pamela; with a word by
the bye of Colley Cibber and others._


It is a trite but true observation, that examples work more forcibly on
the mind than precepts: and if this be just in what is odious and
blameable, it is more strongly so in what is amiable and praiseworthy.
Here emulation most effectually operates upon us, and inspires our
imitation in an irresistible manner. A good man therefore is a standing
lesson to all his acquaintance, and of far greater use in that narrow
circle than a good book.

But as it often happens that the best men are but little known, and
consequently cannot extend the usefulness of their examples a great way;
the writer may be called in aid to spread their history farther, and to
present the amiable pictures to those who have not the happiness of
knowing the originals; and so, by communicating such valuable patterns
to the world, he may perhaps do a more extensive service to mankind than
the person whose life originally afforded the pattern.

In this light I have always regarded those biographers who have recorded
the actions of great and worthy persons of both sexes. Not to mention
those antient writers which of late days are little read, being written
in obsolete, and as they are generally thought, unintelligible
languages, such as Plutarch, Nepos, and others which I heard of in my
youth; our own language affords many of excellent use and instruction,
finely calculated to sow the seeds of virtue in youth, and very easy to
be comprehended by persons of moderate capacity. Such as the history of
John the Great, who, by his brave and heroic actions against men of
large and athletic bodies, obtained the glorious appellation of the
Giant-killer; that of an Earl of Warwick, whose Christian name was Guy;
the lives of Argalus and Parthenia; and above all, the history of those
seven worthy personages, the Champions of Christendom. In all these
delight is mixed with instruction, and the reader is almost as much
improved as entertained.

But I pass by these and many others to mention two books lately
published, which represent an admirable pattern of the amiable in either
sex. The former of these, which deals in male virtue, was written by the
great person himself, who lived the life he hath recorded, and is by
many thought to have lived such a life only in order to write it. The
other is communicated to us by an historian who borrows his lights, as
the common method is, from authentic papers and records. The reader, I
believe, already conjectures, I mean the lives of Mr Colley Cibber and
of Mrs Pamela Andrews. How artfully doth the former, by insinuating that
he escaped being promoted to the highest stations in Church and State,
teach us a contempt of worldly grandeur! how strongly doth he inculcate
an absolute submission to our superiors! Lastly, how completely doth he
arm us against so uneasy, so wretched a passion as the fear of shame!
how clearly doth he expose the emptiness and vanity of that phantom,
reputation!

What the female readers are taught by the memoirs of Mrs Andrews is so
well set forth in the excellent essays or letters prefixed to the second
and subsequent editions of that work, that it would be here a needless
repetition. The authentic history with which I now present the public is
an instance of the great good that book is likely to do, and of the
prevalence of example which I have just observed: since it will appear
that it was by keeping the excellent pattern of his sister's virtues
before his eyes, that Mr Joseph Andrews was chiefly enabled to preserve
his purity in the midst of such great temptations. I shall only add that
this character of male chastity, though doubtless as desirable and
becoming in one part of the human species as in the other, is almost the
only virtue which the great apologist hath not given himself for the
sake of giving the example to his readers.



CHAPTER II.

_Of Mr Joseph Andrews, his birth, parentage, education, and great
endowments; with a word or two concerning ancestors._


Mr Joseph Andrews, the hero of our ensuing history, was esteemed to be
the only son of Gaffar and Gammer Andrews, and brother to the
illustrious Pamela, whose virtue is at present so famous. As to his
ancestors, we have searched with great diligence, but little success;
being unable to trace them farther than his great-grandfather, who, as
an elderly person in the parish remembers to have heard his father say,
was an excellent cudgel-player. Whether he had any ancestors before
this, we must leave to the opinion of our curious reader, finding
nothing of sufficient certainty to rely on. However, we cannot omit
inserting an epitaph which an ingenious friend of ours hath
communicated:--

    Stay, traveller, for underneath this pew
    Lies fast asleep that merry man Andrew:
    When the last day's great sun shall gild the skies,
    Then he shall from his tomb get up and rise.
    Be merry while thou canst: for surely thou
    Shalt shortly be as sad as he is now.

The words are almost out of the stone with antiquity. But it is needless
to observe that Andrew here is writ without an _s_, and is, besides, a
Christian name. My friend, moreover, conjectures this to have been the
founder of that sect of laughing philosophers since called
Merry-andrews.

To waive, therefore, a circumstance which, though mentioned in
conformity to the exact rules of biography, is not greatly material, I
proceed to things of more consequence. Indeed, it is sufficiently
certain that he had as many ancestors as the best man living, and,
perhaps, if we look five or six hundred years backwards, might be
related to some persons of very great figure at present, whose ancestors
within half the last century are buried in as great obscurity. But
suppose, for argument's sake, we should admit that he had no ancestors
at all, but had sprung up, according to the modern phrase, out of a
dunghill, as the Athenians pretended they themselves did from the earth,
would not this autokopros[A] have been justly entitled to all the
praise arising from his own virtues? Would it not be hard that a man who
hath no ancestors should therefore be rendered incapable of acquiring
honour; when we see so many who have no virtues enjoying the honour of
their forefathers? At ten years old (by which time his education was
advanced to writing and reading) he was bound an apprentice, according
to the statute, to Sir Thomas Booby, an uncle of Mr Booby's by the
father's side. Sir Thomas having then an estate in his own hands, the
young Andrews was at first employed in what in the country they call
keeping birds. His office was to perform the part the ancients assigned
to the god Priapus, which deity the moderns call by the name of Jack o'
Lent; but his voice being so extremely musical, that it rather allured
the birds than terrified them, he was soon transplanted from the fields
into the dog-kennel, where he was placed under the huntsman, and made
what the sportsmen term whipper-in. For this place likewise the
sweetness of his voice disqualified him; the dogs preferring the melody
of his chiding to all the alluring notes of the huntsman, who soon
became so incensed at it, that he desired Sir Thomas to provide
otherwise for him, and constantly laid every fault the dogs were at to
the account of the poor boy, who was now transplanted to the stable.
Here he soon gave proofs of strength and agility beyond his years, and
constantly rode the most spirited and vicious horses to water, with an
intrepidity which surprized every one. While he was in this station, he
rode several races for Sir Thomas, and this with such expertness and
success, that the neighbouring gentlemen frequently solicited the knight
to permit little Joey (for so he was called) to ride their matches. The
best gamesters, before they laid their money, always inquired which
horse little Joey was to ride; and the bets were rather proportioned by
the rider than by the horse himself; especially after he had scornfully
refused a considerable bribe to play booty on such an occasion. This
extremely raised his character, and so pleased the Lady Booby, that she
desired to have him (being now seventeen years of age) for her
own footboy.

[A] In English, sprung from a dunghill.

Joey was now preferred from the stable to attend on his lady, to go on
her errands, stand behind her chair, wait at her tea-table, and carry
her prayer-book to church; at which place his voice gave him an
opportunity of distinguishing himself by singing psalms: he behaved
likewise in every other respect so well at Divine service, that it
recommended him to the notice of Mr Abraham Adams, the curate, who took
an opportunity one day, as he was drinking a cup of ale in Sir Thomas's
kitchen, to ask the young man several questions concerning religion;
with his answers to which he was wonderfully pleased.



CHAPTER III.

_Of Mr Abraham Adams the curate, Mrs Slipslop the chambermaid, and
others._


Mr Abraham Adams was an excellent scholar. He was a perfect master of
the Greek and Latin languages; to which he added a great share of
knowledge in the Oriental tongues; and could read and translate French,
Italian, and Spanish. He had applied many years to the most severe
study, and had treasured up a fund of learning rarely to be met with in
a university. He was, besides, a man of good sense, good parts, and good
nature; but was at the same time as entirely ignorant of the ways of
this world as an infant just entered into it could possibly be. As he
had never any intention to deceive, so he never suspected such a design
in others. He was generous, friendly, and brave to an excess; but
simplicity was his characteristick: he did, no more than Mr Colley
Cibber, apprehend any such passions as malice and envy to exist in
mankind; which was indeed less remarkable in a country parson than in a
gentleman who hath passed his life behind the scenes,--a place which
hath been seldom thought the school of innocence, and where a very
little observation would have convinced the great apologist that those
passions have a real existence in the human mind.

His virtue, and his other qualifications, as they rendered him equal to
his office, so they made him an agreeable and valuable companion, and
had so much endeared and well recommended him to a bishop, that at the
age of fifty he was provided with a handsome income of twenty-three
pounds a year; which, however, he could not make any great figure with,
because he lived in a dear country, and was a little encumbered with a
wife and six children.

It was this gentleman, who having, as I have said, observed the singular
devotion of young Andrews, had found means to question him concerning
several particulars; as, how many books there were in the New Testament?
which were they? how many chapters they contained? and such like: to all
which, Mr Adams privately said, he answered much better than Sir Thomas,
or two other neighbouring justices of the peace could probably
have done.

Mr Adams was wonderfully solicitous to know at what time, and by what
opportunity, the youth became acquainted with these matters: Joey told
him that he had very early learnt to read and write by the goodness of
his father, who, though he had not interest enough to get him into a
charity school, because a cousin of his father's landlord did not vote
on the right side for a churchwarden in a borough town, yet had been
himself at the expense of sixpence a week for his learning. He told him
likewise, that ever since he was in Sir Thomas's family he had employed
all his hours of leisure in reading good books; that he had read the
Bible, the Whole Duty of Man, and Thomas a Kempis; and that as often as
he could, without being perceived, he had studied a great good book
which lay open in the hall window, where he had read, "as how the devil
carried away half a church in sermon-time, without hurting one of the
congregation; and as how a field of corn ran away down a hill with all
the trees upon it, and covered another man's meadow." This sufficiently
assured Mr Adams that the good book meant could be no other than Baker's
Chronicle.

The curate, surprized to find such instances of industry and application
in a young man who had never met with the least encouragement, asked
him, If he did not extremely regret the want of a liberal education, and
the not having been born of parents who might have indulged his talents
and desire of knowledge? To which he answered, "He hoped he had profited
somewhat better from the books he had read than to lament his condition
in this world. That, for his part, he was perfectly content with the
state to which he was called; that he should endeavour to improve his
talent, which was all required of him; but not repine at his own lot,
nor envy those of his betters." "Well said, my lad," replied the curate;
"and I wish some who have read many more good books, nay, and some who
have written good books themselves, had profited so much by them."

Adams had no nearer access to Sir Thomas or my lady than through the
waiting-gentlewoman; for Sir Thomas was too apt to estimate men merely
by their dress or fortune; and my lady was a woman of gaiety, who had
been blest with a town education, and never spoke of any of her country
neighbours by any other appellation than that of the brutes. They both
regarded the curate as a kind of domestic only, belonging to the parson
of the parish, who was at this time at variance with the knight; for the
parson had for many years lived in a constant state of civil war, or,
which is perhaps as bad, of civil law, with Sir Thomas himself and the
tenants of his manor. The foundation of this quarrel was a modus, by
setting which aside an advantage of several shillings _per annum_ would
have accrued to the rector; but he had not yet been able to accomplish
his purpose, and had reaped hitherto nothing better from the suits than
the pleasure (which he used indeed frequently to say was no small one)
of reflecting that he had utterly undone many of the poor tenants,
though he had at the same time greatly impoverished himself.

Mrs Slipslop, the waiting-gentlewoman, being herself the daughter of a
curate, preserved some respect for Adams: she professed great regard for
his learning, and would frequently dispute with him on points of
theology; but always insisted on a deference to be paid to her
understanding, as she had been frequently at London, and knew more of
the world than a country parson could pretend to.

She had in these disputes a particular advantage over Adams: for she was
a mighty affecter of hard words, which she used in such a manner that
the parson, who durst not offend her by calling her words in question,
was frequently at some loss to guess her meaning, and would have been
much less puzzled by an Arabian manuscript.

Adams therefore took an opportunity one day, after a pretty long
discourse with her on the essence (or, as she pleased to term it, the
incence) of matter, to mention the case of young Andrews; desiring her
to recommend him to her lady as a youth very susceptible of learning,
and one whose instruction in Latin he would himself undertake; by which
means he might be qualified for a higher station than that of a footman;
and added, she knew it was in his master's power easily to provide for
him in a better manner. He therefore desired that the boy might be left
behind under his care.

"La! Mr Adams," said Mrs Slipslop, "do you think my lady will suffer any
preambles about any such matter? She is going to London very concisely,
and I am confidous would not leave Joey behind her on any account; for
he is one of the genteelest young fellows you may see in a summer's day;
and I am confidous she would as soon think of parting with a pair of her
grey mares, for she values herself as much on one as the other." Adams
would have interrupted, but she proceeded: "And why is Latin more
necessitous for a footman than a gentleman? It is very proper that you
clergymen must learn it, because you can't preach without it: but I have
heard gentlemen say in London, that it is fit for nobody else. I am
confidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it; and I shall
draw myself into no such delemy." At which words her lady's bell rung,
and Mr Adams was forced to retire; nor could he gain a second
opportunity with her before their London journey, which happened a few
days afterwards. However, Andrews behaved very thankfully and gratefully
to him for his intended kindness, which he told him he never would
forget, and at the same time received from the good man many admonitions
concerning the regulation of his future conduct, and his perseverance in
innocence and industry.



CHAPTER IV.

_What happened after their journey to London._


No sooner was young Andrews arrived at London than he began to scrape an
acquaintance with his party-coloured brethren, who endeavoured to make
him despise his former course of life. His hair was cut after the newest
fashion, and became his chief care; he went abroad with it all the
morning in papers, and drest it out in the afternoon. They could not,
however, teach him to game, swear, drink, nor any other genteel vice the
town abounded with. He applied most of his leisure hours to music, in
which he greatly improved himself; and became so perfect a connoisseur
in that art, that he led the opinion of all the other footmen at an
opera, and they never condemned or applauded a single song contrary to
his approbation or dislike. He was a little too forward in riots at the
play-houses and assemblies; and when he attended his lady at church
(which was but seldom) he behaved with less seeming devotion than
formerly: however, if he was outwardly a pretty fellow, his morals
remained entirely uncorrupted, though he was at the same time smarter
and genteeler than any of the beaus in town, either in or out of livery.

His lady, who had often said of him that Joey was the handsomest and
genteelest footman in the kingdom, but that it was pity he wanted
spirit, began now to find that fault no longer; on the contrary, she was
frequently heard to cry out, "Ay, there is some life in this fellow."
She plainly saw the effects which the town air hath on the soberest
constitutions. She would now walk out with him into Hyde Park in a
morning, and when tired, which happened almost every minute, would lean
on his arm, and converse with him in great familiarity. Whenever she
stept out of her coach, she would take him by the hand, and sometimes,
for fear of stumbling, press it very hard; she admitted him to deliver
messages at her bedside in a morning, leered at him at table, and
indulged him in all those innocent freedoms which women of figure may
permit without the least sully of their virtue.

But though their virtue remains unsullied, yet now and then some small
arrows will glance on the shadow of it, their reputation; and so it fell
out to Lady Booby, who happened to be walking arm-in-arm with Joey one
morning in Hyde Park, when Lady Tittle and Lady Tattle came accidentally
by in their coach. "Bless me," says Lady Tittle, "can I believe my eyes?
Is that Lady Booby?"--"Surely," says Tattle. "But what makes you
surprized?"--"Why, is not that her footman?" replied Tittle. At which
Tattle laughed, and cried, "An old business, I assure you: is it
possible you should not have heard it? The whole town hath known it this
half-year." The consequence of this interview was a whisper through a
hundred visits, which were separately performed by the two ladies[A] the
same afternoon, and might have had a mischievous effect, had it not been
stopt by two fresh reputations which were published the day afterwards,
and engrossed the whole talk of the town.

[A] It may seem an absurdity that Tattle should visit, as she actually
    did, to spread a known scandal: but the reader may reconcile this by
    supposing, with me, that, notwithstanding what she says, this was
    her first acquaintance with it.

But, whatever opinion or suspicion the scandalous inclination of
defamers might entertain of Lady Booby's innocent freedoms, it is
certain they made no impression on young Andrews, who never offered to
encroach beyond the liberties which his lady allowed him,--a behaviour
which she imputed to the violent respect he preserved for her, and which
served only to heighten a something she began to conceive, and which
the next chapter will open a little farther.



CHAPTER V.

_The death of Sir Thomas Booby, with the affectionate and mournful
behaviour of his widow, and the great purity of Joseph Andrews._


At this time an accident happened which put a stop to those agreeable
walks, which probably would have soon puffed up the cheeks of Fame, and
caused her to blow her brazen trumpet through the town; and this was no
other than the death of Sir Thomas Booby, who, departing this life, left
his disconsolate lady confined to her house, as closely as if she
herself had been attacked by some violent disease. During the first six
days the poor lady admitted none but Mrs. Slipslop, and three female
friends, who made a party at cards: but on the seventh she ordered Joey,
whom, for a good reason, we shall hereafter call JOSEPH, to bring up her
tea-kettle. The lady being in bed, called Joseph to her, bade him sit
down, and, having accidentally laid her hand on his, she asked him if he
had ever been in love. Joseph answered, with some confusion, it was time
enough for one so young as himself to think on such things. "As young as
you are," replied the lady, "I am convinced you are no stranger to that
passion. Come, Joey," says she, "tell me truly, who is the happy girl
whose eyes have made a conquest of you?" Joseph returned, that all the
women he had ever seen were equally indifferent to him. "Oh then," said
the lady, "you are a general lover. Indeed, you handsome fellows, like
handsome women, are very long and difficult in fixing; but yet you
shall never persuade me that your heart is so insusceptible of
affection; I rather impute what you say to your secrecy, a very
commendable quality, and what I am far from being angry with you for.
Nothing can be more unworthy in a young man, than to betray any
intimacies with the ladies." "Ladies! madam," said Joseph, "I am sure I
never had the impudence to think of any that deserve that name." "Don't
pretend to too much modesty," said she, "for that sometimes may be
impertinent: but pray answer me this question. Suppose a lady should
happen to like you; suppose she should prefer you to all your sex, and
admit you to the same familiarities as you might have hoped for if you
had been born her equal, are you certain that no vanity could tempt you
to discover her? Answer me honestly, Joseph; have you so much more sense
and so much more virtue than you handsome young fellows generally have,
who make no scruple of sacrificing our dear reputation to your pride,
without considering the great obligation we lay on you by our
condescension and confidence? Can you keep a secret, my Joey?" "Madam,"
says he, "I hope your ladyship can't tax me with ever betraying the
secrets of the family; and I hope, if you was to turn me away, I might
have that character of you." "I don't intend to turn you away, Joey,"
said she, and sighed; "I am afraid it is not in my power." She then
raised herself a little in her bed, and discovered one of the whitest
necks that ever was seen; at which Joseph blushed. "La!" says she, in an
affected surprize, "what am I doing? I have trusted myself with a man
alone, naked in bed; suppose you should have any wicked intentions upon
my honour, how should I defend myself?" Joseph protested that he never
had the least evil design against her. "No," says she, "perhaps you may
not call your designs wicked; and perhaps they are not so."--He swore
they were not. "You misunderstand me," says she; "I mean if they were
against my honour, they may not be wicked; but the world calls them so.
But then, say you, the world will never know anything of the matter; yet
would not that be trusting to your secrecy? Must not my reputation be
then in your power? Would you not then be my master?" Joseph begged her
ladyship to be comforted; for that he would never imagine the least
wicked thing against her, and that he had rather die a thousand deaths
than give her any reason to suspect him. "Yes," said she, "I must have
reason to suspect you. Are you not a man? and, without vanity, I may
pretend to some charms. But perhaps you may fear I should prosecute you;
indeed I hope you do; and yet Heaven knows I should never have the
confidence to appear before a court of justice; and you know, Joey, I am
of a forgiving temper. Tell me, Joey, don't you think I should forgive
you?"--"Indeed, madam," says Joseph, "I will never do anything to
disoblige your ladyship."--"How," says she, "do you think it would not
disoblige me then? Do you think I would willingly suffer you?"--"I don't
understand you, madam," says Joseph.--"Don't you?" said she, "then you
are either a fool, or pretend to be so; I find I was mistaken in you. So
get you downstairs, and never let me see your face again; your pretended
innocence cannot impose on me."--"Madam," said Joseph, "I would not have
your ladyship think any evil of me. I have always endeavoured to be a
dutiful servant both to you and my master."--"O thou villain!" answered
my lady; "why didst thou mention the name of that dear man, unless to
torment me, to bring his precious memory to my mind?" (and then she
burst into a fit of tears.) "Get thee from my sight! I shall never
endure thee more." At which words she turned away from him; and Joseph
retreated from the room in a most disconsolate condition, and writ that
letter which the reader will find in the next chapter.



CHAPTER VI.

_How Joseph Andrews writ a letter to his sister Pamela._


"To MRS PAMELA ANDREWS, LIVING WITH SQUIRE BOOBY.

"DEAR SISTER,--Since I received your letter of your good lady's death,
we have had a misfortune of the same kind in our family. My worthy
master Sir Thomas died about four days ago; and, what is worse, my poor
lady is certainly gone distracted. None of the servants expected her to
take it so to heart, because they quarrelled almost every day of their
lives: but no more of that, because you know, Pamela, I never loved to
tell the secrets of my master's family; but to be sure you must have
known they never loved one another; and I have heard her ladyship wish
his honour dead above a thousand times; but nobody knows what it is to
lose a friend till they have lost him.

"Don't tell anybody what I write, because I should not care to have
folks say I discover what passes in our family; but if it had not been
so great a lady, I should have thought she had had a mind to me. Dear
Pamela, don't tell anybody; but she ordered me to sit down by her
bedside, when she was naked in bed; and she held my hand, and talked
exactly as a lady does to her sweetheart in a stage-play, which I have
seen in Covent Garden, while she wanted him to be no better than he
should be.

"If madam be mad, I shall not care for staying long in the family; so I
heartily wish you could get me a place, either at the squire's, or some
other neighbouring gentleman's, unless it be true that you are going to
be married to parson Williams, as folks talk, and then I should be very
willing to be his clerk; for which you know I am qualified, being able
to read and to set a psalm.

"I fancy I shall be discharged very soon; and the moment I am, unless I
hear from you, I shall return to my old master's country-seat, if it be
only to see parson Adams, who is the best man in the world. London is a
bad place, and there is so little good fellowship, that the next-door
neighbours don't know one another. Pray give my service to all friends
that inquire for me. So I rest

"Your loving brother,

"JOSEPH ANDREWS."

As soon as Joseph had sealed and directed this letter he walked
downstairs, where he met Mrs. Slipslop, with whom we shall take this
opportunity to bring the reader a little better acquainted. She was a
maiden gentlewoman of about forty-five years of age, who, having made a
small slip in her youth, had continued a good maid ever since. She was
not at this time remarkably handsome; being very short, and rather too
corpulent in body, and somewhat red, with the addition of pimples in the
face. Her nose was likewise rather too large, and her eyes too little;
nor did she resemble a cow so much in her breath as in two brown globes
which she carried before her; one of her legs was also a little shorter
than the other, which occasioned her to limp as she walked. This fair
creature had long cast the eyes of affection on Joseph, in which she had
not met with quite so good success as she probably wished, though,
besides the allurements of her native charms, she had given him tea,
sweetmeats, wine, and many other delicacies, of which, by keeping the
keys, she had the absolute command. Joseph, however, had not returned
the least gratitude to all these favours, not even so much as a kiss;
though I would not insinuate she was so easily to be satisfied; for
surely then he would have been highly blameable. The truth is, she was
arrived at an age when she thought she might indulge herself in any
liberties with a man, without the danger of bringing a third person into
the world to betray them. She imagined that by so long a self-denial she
had not only made amends for the small slip of her youth above hinted
at, but had likewise laid up a quantity of merit to excuse any future
failings. In a word, she resolved to give a loose to her amorous
inclinations, and to pay off the debt of pleasure which she found she
owed herself, as fast as possible.

With these charms of person, and in this disposition of mind, she
encountered poor Joseph at the bottom of the stairs, and asked him if he
would drink a glass of something good this morning. Joseph, whose
spirits were not a little cast down, very readily and thankfully
accepted the offer; and together they went into a closet, where, having
delivered him a full glass of ratafia, and desired him to sit down, Mrs.
Slipslop thus began:--

"Sure nothing can be a more simple contract in a woman than to place her
affections on a boy. If I had ever thought it would have been my fate, I
should have wished to die a thousand deaths rather than live to see that
day. If we like a man, the lightest hint sophisticates. Whereas a boy
proposes upon us to break through all the regulations of modesty, before
we can make any oppression upon him." Joseph, who did not understand a
word she said, answered, "Yes, madam."--"Yes, madam!" replied Mrs.
Slipslop with some warmth, "Do you intend to result my passion? Is it
not enough, ungrateful as you are, to make no return to all the favours
I have done you; but you must treat me with ironing? Barbarous monster!
how have I deserved that my passion should be resulted and treated with
ironing?" "Madam," answered Joseph, "I don't understand your hard words;
but I am certain you have no occasion to call me ungrateful, for, so far
from intending you any wrong, I have always loved you as well as if you
had been my own mother." "How, sirrah!" says Mrs. Slipslop in a rage;
"your own mother? Do you assinuate that I am old enough to be your
mother? I don't know what a stripling may think, but I believe a man
would refer me to any green-sickness silly girl whatsomdever: but I
ought to despise you rather than be angry with you, for referring the
conversation of girls to that of a woman of sense."--"Madam," says
Joseph, "I am sure I have always valued the honour you did me by your
conversation, for I know you are a woman of learning."--"Yes, but,
Joseph," said she, a little softened by the compliment to her learning,
"if you had a value for me, you certainly would have found some method
of showing it me; for I am convicted you must see the value I have for
you. Yes, Joseph, my eyes, whether I would or no, must have declared a
passion I cannot conquer.--Oh! Joseph!"

As when a hungry tigress, who long has traversed the woods in fruitless
search, sees within the reach of her claws a lamb, she prepares to leap
on her prey; or as a voracious pike, of immense size, surveys through
the liquid element a roach or gudgeon, which cannot escape her jaws,
opens them wide to swallow the little fish; so did Mrs. Slipslop prepare
to lay her violent amorous hands on the poor Joseph, when luckily her
mistress's bell rung, and delivered the intended martyr from her
clutches. She was obliged to leave him abruptly, and to defer the
execution of her purpose till some other time. We shall therefore return
to the Lady Booby, and give our reader some account of her behaviour,
after she was left by Joseph in a temper of mind not greatly different
from that of the inflamed Slipslop.



CHAPTER VII.

_Sayings of wise men. A dialogue between the lady and her maid; and a
panegyric, or rather satire, on the passion of love, in the
sublime style._


It is the observation of some antient sage, whose name I have forgot,
that passions operate differently on the human mind, as diseases on the
body, in proportion to the strength or weakness, soundness or
rottenness, of the one and the other.

We hope, therefore, a judicious reader will give himself some pains to
observe, what we have so greatly laboured to describe, the different
operations of this passion of love in the gentle and cultivated mind of
the Lady Booby, from those which it effected in the less polished and
coarser disposition of Mrs Slipslop.

Another philosopher, whose name also at present escapes my memory, hath
somewhere said, that resolutions taken in the absence of the beloved
object are very apt to vanish in its presence; on both which wise
sayings the following chapter may serve as a comment.

No sooner had Joseph left the room in the manner we have before related
than the lady, enraged at her disappointment, began to reflect with
severity on her conduct. Her love was now changed to disdain, which
pride assisted to torment her. She despised herself for the meanness of
her passion, and Joseph for its ill success. However, she had now got
the better of it in her own opinion, and determined immediately to
dismiss the object. After much tossing and turning in her bed, and many
soliloquies, which if we had no better matter for our reader we would
give him, she at last rung the bell as above mentioned, and was
presently attended by Mrs Slipslop, who was not much better pleased with
Joseph than the lady herself.

"Slipslop," said Lady Booby, "when did you see Joseph?" The poor woman
was so surprized at the unexpected sound of his name at so critical a
time, that she had the greatest difficulty to conceal the confusion she
was under from her mistress; whom she answered, nevertheless, with
pretty good confidence, though not entirely void of fear of suspicion,
that she had not seen him that morning. "I am afraid," said Lady Booby,
"he is a wild young fellow."--"That he is," said Slipslop, "and a
wicked one too. To my knowledge he games, drinks, swears, and fights
eternally; besides, he is horribly indicted to wenching."--"Ay!" said
the lady, "I never heard that of him."--"O madam!" answered the other,
"he is so lewd a rascal, that if your ladyship keeps him much longer,
you will not have one virgin in your house except myself. And yet I
can't conceive what the wenches see in him, to be so foolishly fond as
they are; in my eyes, he is as ugly a scarecrow as I ever
upheld."--"Nay," said the lady, "the boy is well enough."--"La! ma'am,"
cries Slipslop, "I think him the ragmaticallest fellow in the
family."--"Sure, Slipslop," says she, "you are mistaken: but which of
the women do you most suspect?"--"Madam," says Slipslop, "there is Betty
the chambermaid, I am almost convicted, is with child by him."--"Ay!"
says the lady, "then pray pay her her wages instantly. I will keep no
such sluts in my family. And as for Joseph, you may discard him
too."--"Would your ladyship have him paid off immediately?" cries
Slipslop, "for perhaps, when Betty is gone he may mend: and really the
boy is a good servant, and a strong healthy luscious boy enough."--
"This morning," answered the lady with some vehemence. "I wish, madam,"
cries Slipslop, "your ladyship would be so good as to try him a little
longer."--"I will not have my commands disputed," said the lady; "sure
you are not fond of him yourself?"--"I, madam!" cries Slipslop,
reddening, if not blushing, "I should be sorry to think your ladyship
had any reason to respect me of fondness for a fellow; and if it be your
pleasure, I shall fulfil it with as much reluctance as possible."--"As
little, I suppose you mean," said the lady; "and so about it instantly."
Mrs. Slipslop went out, and the lady had scarce taken two turns before
she fell to knocking and ringing with great violence. Slipslop, who did
not travel post haste, soon returned, and was countermanded as to
Joseph, but ordered to send Betty about her business without delay. She
went out a second time with much greater alacrity than before; when the
lady began immediately to accuse herself of want of resolution, and to
apprehend the return THE WORKS OF HENRY FIELDING

CHAPTER XIV.

_An interview between parson Adams and parson Trulliber._


Parson Adams came to the house of parson Trulliber, whom he found
stript into his waistcoat, with an apron on, and a pail in his hand,
just come from serving his hogs; for Mr Trulliber was a parson on
Sundays, but all the other six might more properly be called a farmer.
He occupied a small piece of land of his own, besides which he rented a
considerable deal more. His wife milked his cows, managed his dairy,
and followed the markets with butter and eggs. The hogs fell chiefly to
his care, which he carefully waited on at home, and attended to fairs;
on which occasion he was liable to many jokes, his own size being, with
much ale, rendered little inferior to that of the beasts he sold. He
was indeed one of the largest men you should see, and could have acted
the part of Sir John Falstaff without stuffing. Add to this that the
rotundity of his belly was considerably increased by the shortness of
his stature, his shadow ascending very near as far in height, when he
lay on his back, as when he stood on his legs. His voice was loud and
hoarse, and his accents extremely broad. To complete the whole, he had
a stateliness in his gait, when he walked, not unlike that of a goose,
only he stalked slower.

Mr Trulliber, being informed that somebody wanted to speak with him,
immediately slipt off his apron and clothed himself in an old
night-gown, being the dress in which he always saw his company at home.
His wife, who informed him of Mr Adams's arrival, had made a small
mistake; for she had told her husband, "She believed there was a man
come for some of his hogs." This supposition made Mr Trulliber hasten
with the utmost expedition to attend his guest. He no sooner saw Adams
than, not in the least doubting the cause of his errand to be what his
wife had imagined, he told him, "He was come in very good time; that he
expected a dealer that very afternoon;" and added, "they were all pure
and fat, and upwards of twenty score a-piece." Adams answered, "He
believed he did not know him." "Yes, yes," cried Trulliber, "I have seen
you often at fair; why, we have dealt before now, mun, I warrant you.
Yes, yes," cries he, "I remember thy face very well, but won't mention a
word more till you have seen them, though I have never sold thee a
flitch of such bacon as is now in the stye." Upon which he laid violent
hands on Adams, and dragged him into the hog-stye, which was indeed but
two steps from his parlour window. They were no sooner arrived there
than he cry'd out, "Do but handle them! step in, friend! art welcome to
handle them, whether dost buy or no." At which words, opening the gate,
he pushed Adams into the pig-stye, insisting on it that he should handle
them before he would talk one word with him.

Adams, whose natural complacence was beyond any artificial, was obliged
to comply before he was suffered to explain himself; and, laying hold on
one of their tails, the unruly beast gave such a sudden spring, that he
threw poor Adams all along in the mire. Trulliber, instead of assisting
him to get up, burst into a laughter, and, entering the stye, said to
Adams, with some contempt, "Why, dost not know how to handle a hog?" and
was going to lay hold of one himself, but Adams, who thought he had
carried his complacence far enough, was no sooner on his legs than he
escaped out of the reach of the animals, and cried out, "_Nihil habeo
cum porcis_: I am a clergyman, sir, and am not come to buy hogs."
Trulliber answered, "He was sorry for the mistake, but that he must
blame his wife," adding, "she was a fool, and always committed
blunders." He then desired him to walk in and clean himself, that he
would only fasten up the stye and follow him. Adams desired leave to dry
his greatcoat, wig, and hat by the fire, which Trulliber granted. Mrs
Trulliber would have brought him a basin of water to wash his face, but
her husband bid her be quiet like a fool as she was, or she would commit
more blunders, and then directed Adams to the pump. While Adams was thus
employed, Trulliber, conceiving no great respect for the appearance of
his guest, fastened the parlour door, and now conducted him into the
kitchen, telling him he believed a cup of drink would do him no harm,
and whispered his wife to draw a little of the worst ale. After a short
silence Adams said, "I fancy, sir, you already perceive me to be a
clergyman."--"Ay, ay," cries Trulliber, grinning, "I perceive you have
some cassock; I will not venture to caale it a whole one." Adams
answered, "It was indeed none of the best, but he had the misfortune to
tear it about ten years ago in passing over a stile." Mrs Trulliber,
returning with the drink, told her husband, "She fancied the gentleman
was a traveller, and that he would be glad to eat a bit." Trulliber bid
her hold her impertinent tongue, and asked her, "If parsons used to
travel without horses?" adding, "he supposed the gentleman had none by
his having no boots on."--"Yes, sir, yes," says Adams; "I have a horse,
but I have left him behind me."--"I am glad to hear you have one," says
Trulliber; "for I assure you I don't love to see clergymen on foot; it
is not seemly nor suiting the dignity of the cloth." Here Trulliber made
a long oration on the dignity of the cloth (or rather gown) not much
worth relating, till his wife had spread the table and set a mess of
porridge on it for his breakfast. He then said to Adams, "I don't know,
friend, how you came to caale on me; however, as you are here, if you
think proper to eat a morsel, you may." Adams accepted the invitation,
and the two parsons sat down together; Mrs Trulliber waiting behind her
husband's chair, as was, it seems, her custom. Trulliber eat heartily,
but scarce put anything in his mouth without finding fault with his
wife's cookery. All which the poor woman bore patiently. Indeed, she was
so absolute an admirer of her husband's greatness and importance, of
which she had frequent hints from his own mouth, that she almost carried
her adoration to an opinion of his infallibility. To say the truth, the
parson had exercised her more ways than one; and the pious woman had so
well edified by her husband's sermons, that she had resolved to receive
the bad things of this world together with the good. She had indeed been
at first a little contentious; but he had long since got the better;
partly by her love for this, partly by her fear of that, partly by her
religion, partly by the respect he paid himself, and partly by that
which he received from the parish. She had, in short, absolutely
submitted, and now worshipped her husband, as Sarah did Abraham, calling
him (not lord, but) master. Whilst they were at table her husband gave
her a fresh example of his greatness; for, as she had just delivered a
cup of ale to Adams, he snatched it out of his hand, and, crying out, "I
caal'd vurst," swallowed down the ale. Adams denied it; it was referred
to the wife, who, though her conscience was on the side of Adams, durst
not give it against her husband; upon which he said, "No, sir, no; I
should not have been so rude to have taken it from you if you had caal'd
vurst, but I'd have you know I'm a better man than to suffer the best he
in the kingdom to drink before me in my own house when I caale vurst."

As soon as their breakfast was ended, Adams began in the following
manner: "I think, sir, it is high time to inform you of the business of
my embassy. I am a traveller, and am passing this way in company with
two young people, a lad and a damsel, my parishioners, towards my own
cure; we stopt at a house of hospitality in the parish, where they
directed me to you as having the cure."--"Though I am but a curate,"
says Trulliber, "I believe I am as warm as the vicar himself, or perhaps
the rector of the next parish too; I believe I could buy them
both."--"Sir," cries Adams, "I rejoice thereat. Now, sir, my business
is, that we are by various accidents stript of our money, and are not
able to pay our reckoning, being seven shillings. I therefore request
you to assist me with the loan of those seven shillings, and also seven
shillings more, which, peradventure, I shall return to you; but if not,
I am convinced you will joyfully embrace such an opportunity of laying
up a treasure in a better place than any this world affords."

Suppose a stranger, who entered the chambers of a lawyer, being imagined
a client, when the lawyer was preparing his palm for the fee, should
pull out a writ against him. Suppose an apothecary, at the door of a
chariot containing some great doctor of eminent skill, should, instead
of directions to a patient, present him with a potion for himself.
Suppose a minister should, instead of a good round sum, treat my lord
----, or sir ----, or esq. ---- with a good broomstick. Suppose a civil
companion, or a led captain, should, instead of virtue, and honour, and
beauty, and parts, and admiration, thunder vice, and infamy, and
ugliness, and folly, and contempt, in his patron's ears. Suppose, when a
tradesman first carries in his bill, the man of fashion should pay it;
or suppose, if he did so, the tradesman should abate what he had
overcharged, on the supposition of waiting. In short--suppose what you
will, you never can nor will suppose anything equal to the astonishment
which seized on Trulliber, as soon as Adams had ended his speech. A
while he rolled his eyes in silence; sometimes surveying Adams, then his
wife; then casting them on the ground, then lifting them up to heaven.
At last he burst forth in the following accents: "Sir, I believe I know
where to lay up my little treasure as well as another. I thank G--, if I
am not so warm as some, I am content; that is a blessing greater than
riches; and he to whom that is given need ask no more. To be content
with a little is greater than to possess the world; which a man may
possess without being so. Lay up my treasure! what matters where a man's
treasure is whose heart is in the Scriptures? there is the treasure of a
Christian." At these words the water ran from Adams's eyes; and,
catching Trulliber by the hand in a rapture, "Brother," says he,
"heavens bless the accident by which I came to see you! I would have
walked many a mile to have communed with you; and, believe me, I will
shortly pay you a second visit; but my friends, I fancy, by this time,
wonder at my stay; so let me have the money immediately." Trulliber then
put on a stern look, and cried out, "Thou dost not intend to rob me?" At
which the wife, bursting into tears, fell on her knees and roared out,
"O dear sir! for Heaven's sake don't rob my master; we are but poor
people." "Get up, for a fool as thou art, and go about thy business,"
said Trulliber; "dost think the man will venture his life? he is a
beggar, and no robber." "Very true, indeed," answered Adams. "I wish,
with all my heart, the tithing-man was here," cries Trulliber; "I would
have thee punished as a vagabond for thy impudence. Fourteen shillings
indeed! I won't give thee a farthing. I believe thou art no more a
clergyman than the woman there" (pointing to his wife); "but if thou
art, dost deserve to have thy gown stript over thy shoulders for running
about the country in such a manner." "I forgive your suspicions," says
Adams; "but suppose I am not a clergyman, I am nevertheless thy brother;
and thou, as a Christian, much more as a clergyman, art obliged to
relieve my distress." "Dost preach to me?" replied Trulliber; "dost
pretend to instruct me in my duty?" "Ifacks, a good story," cries Mrs
Trulliber, "to preach to my master." "Silence, woman," cries Trulliber.
"I would have thee know, friend" (addressing himself to Adams), "I shall
not learn my duty from such as thee. I know what charity is, better than
to give to vagabonds." "Besides, if we were inclined, the poor's rate
obliges us to give so much charity," cries the wife. "Pugh! thou art a
fool. Poor's reate! Hold thy nonsense," answered Trulliber; and then,
turning to Adams, he told him, "he would give him nothing." "I am
sorry," answered Adams, "that you do know what charity is, since you
practise it no better: I must tell you, if you trust to your knowledge
for your justification, you will find yourself deceived, though you
should add faith to it, without good works." "Fellow," cries Trulliber,
"dost thou speak against faith in my house? Get out of my doors: I will
no longer remain under the same roof with a wretch who speaks wantonly
of faith and the Scriptures." "Name not the Scriptures," says Adams.
"How! not name the Scriptures! Do you disbelieve the Scriptures?" cries
Trulliber. "No; but you do," answered Adams, "if I may reason from your
practice; for their commands are so explicit, and their rewards and
punishments so immense, that it is impossible a man should stedfastly
believe without obeying. Now, there is no command more express, no duty
more frequently enjoined, than charity. Whoever, therefore, is void of
charity, I make no scruple of pronouncing that he is no Christian." "I
would not advise thee," says Trulliber, "to say that I am no Christian:
I won't take it of you; for I believe I am as good a man as thyself"
(and indeed, though he was now rather too corpulent for athletic
exercises, he had, in his youth, been one of the best boxers and
cudgel-players in the county). His wife, seeing him clench his fist,
interposed, and begged him not to fight, but show himself a true
Christian, and take the law of him. As nothing could provoke Adams to
strike, but an absolute assault on himself or his friend, he smiled at
the angry look and gestures of Trulliber; and, telling him he was sorry
to see such men in orders, departed without further ceremony.



CHAPTER XV.

_An adventure, the consequence of a new instance which parson Adams gave
of his forgetfulness._


When he came back to the inn he found Joseph and Fanny sitting together.
They were so far from thinking his absence long, as he had feared they
would, that they never once missed or thought of him. Indeed, I have
been often assured by both, that they spent these hours in a most
delightful conversation; but, as I never could prevail on either to
relate it, so I cannot communicate it to the reader.

Adams acquainted the lovers with the ill success of his enterprize. They
were all greatly confounded, none being able to propose any method of
departing, till Joseph at last advised calling in the hostess, and
desiring her to trust them; which Fanny said she despaired of her doing,
as she was one of the sourest-faced women she had ever beheld.

But she was agreeably disappointed; for the hostess was no sooner asked
the question than she readily agreed; and, with a curtsy and smile,
wished them a good journey. However, lest Fanny's skill in physiognomy
should be called in question, we will venture to assign one reason
which might probably incline her to this confidence and good-humour.
When Adams said he was going to visit his brother, he had unwittingly
imposed on Joseph and Fanny, who both believed he had meant his natural
brother, and not his brother in divinity, and had so informed the
hostess, on her enquiry after him. Now Mr Trulliber had, by his
professions of piety, by his gravity, austerity, reserve, and the
opinion of his great wealth, so great an authority in his parish, that
they all lived in the utmost fear and apprehension of him. It was
therefore no wonder that the hostess, who knew it was in his option
whether she should ever sell another mug of drink, did not dare to
affront his supposed brother by denying him credit.

They were now just on their departure when Adams recollected he had left
his greatcoat and hat at Mr Trulliber's. As he was not desirous of
renewing his visit, the hostess herself, having no servant at home,
offered to fetch it.

This was an unfortunate expedient; for the hostess was soon undeceived
in the opinion she had entertained of Adams, whom Trulliber abused in
the grossest terms, especially when he heard he had had the assurance to
pretend to be his near relation.

At her return, therefore, she entirely changed her note. She said,
"Folks might be ashamed of travelling about, and pretending to be what
they were not. That taxes were high, and for her part she was obliged to
pay for what she had; she could not therefore possibly, nor would she,
trust anybody; no, not her own father. That money was never scarcer, and
she wanted to make up a sum. That she expected, therefore, they should
pay their reckoning before they left the house."

Adams was now greatly perplexed; but, as he knew that he could easily
have borrowed such a sum in his own parish, and as he knew he would have
lent it himself to any mortal in distress, so he took fresh courage, and
sallied out all round the parish, but to no purpose; he returned as
pennyless as he went, groaning and lamenting that it was possible, in a
country professing Christianity, for a wretch to starve in the midst of
his fellow-creatures who abounded.

Whilst he was gone, the hostess, who stayed as a sort of guard with
Joseph and Fanny, entertained them with the goodness of parson
Trulliber. And, indeed, he had not only a very good character as to
other qualities in the neighbourhood, but was reputed a man of great
charity; for, though he never gave a farthing, he had always that word
in his mouth.

Adams was no sooner returned the second time than the storm grew
exceedingly high, the hostess declaring, among other things, that, if
they offered to stir without paying her, she would soon overtake them
with a warrant.

Plato and Aristotle, or somebody else, hath said, _that when the most
exquisite cunning fails, chance often hits the mark, and that by means
the least expected_. Virgil expresses this very boldly:--

    _Turne, quod optanti divum promittere nemo
    Auderet, volvenda dies, en! attulit ultro._

I would quote more great men if I could; but my memory not permitting
me, I will proceed to exemplify these observations by the following
instance:--

There chanced (for Adams had not cunning enough to contrive it) to be at
that time in the alehouse a fellow who had been formerly a drummer in an
Irish regiment, and now travelled the country as a pedlar. This man,
having attentively listened to the discourse of the hostess, at last
took Adams aside, and asked him what the sum was for which they were
detained. As soon as he was informed, he sighed, and said, "He was sorry
it was so much; for that he had no more than six shillings and sixpence
in his pocket, which he would lend them with all his heart." Adams gave
a caper, and cry'd out, "It would do; for that he had sixpence himself."
And thus these poor people, who could not engage the compassion of
riches and piety, were at length delivered out of their distress by the
charity of a poor pedlar.

I shall refer it to my reader to make what observations he pleases on
this incident: it is sufficient for me to inform him that, after Adams
and his companions had returned him a thousand thanks, and told him
where he might call to be repaid, they all sallied out of the house
without any compliments from their hostess, or indeed without paying her
any; Adams declaring he would take particular care never to call there
again; and she on her side assuring them she wanted no such guests.



CHAPTER XVI.

_A very curious adventure, in which Mr Adams gave a much greater
instance of the honest simplicity of his heart, than of his experience
in the ways of this world._


Our travellers had walked about two miles from that inn, which they had
more reason to have mistaken for a castle than Don Quixote ever had any
of those in which he sojourned, seeing they had met with such difficulty
in escaping out of its walls, when they came to a parish, and beheld a
sign of invitation hanging out. A gentleman sat smoaking a pipe at the
door, of whom Adams inquired the road, and received so courteous and
obliging an answer, accompanied with so smiling a countenance, that the
good parson, whose heart was naturally disposed to love and affection,
began to ask several other questions; particularly the name of the
parish, and who was the owner of a large house whose front they then had
in prospect. The gentleman answered as obligingly as before; and as to
the house, acquainted him it was his own. He then proceeded in the
following manner: "Sir, I presume by your habit you are a clergyman; and
as you are travelling on foot I suppose a glass of good beer will not be
disagreeable to you; and I can recommend my landlord's within as some of
the best in all this country. What say you, will you halt a little and
let us take a pipe together? there is no better tobacco in the kingdom."
This proposal was not displeasing to Adams, who had allayed his thirst
that day with no better liquor than what Mrs Trulliber's cellar had
produced; and which was indeed little superior, either in richness or
flavour, to that which distilled from those grains her generous husband
bestowed on his hogs. Having, therefore, abundantly thanked the
gentleman for his kind invitation, and bid Joseph and Fanny follow him,
he entered the alehouse, where a large loaf and cheese and a pitcher of
beer, which truly answered the character given of it, being set before
them, the three travellers fell to eating, with appetites infinitely
more voracious than are to be found at the most exquisite eating-houses
in the parish of St. James's.

The gentleman expressed great delight in the hearty and cheerful
behaviour of Adams; and particularly in the familiarity with which he
conversed with Joseph and Fanny, whom he often called his children; a
term he explained to mean no more than his parishioners; saying, "He
looked on all those whom God had intrusted to his care to stand to him
in that relation." The gentleman, shaking him by the hand, highly
applauded those sentiments. "They are, indeed," says he, "the true
principles of a Christian divine; and I heartily wish they were
universal; but, on the contrary, I am sorry to say the parson of our
parish, instead of esteeming his poor parishioners as a part of his
family, seems rather to consider them as not of the same species with
himself. He seldom speaks to any, unless some few of the richest of
us; nay, indeed, he will not move his hat to the others. I often laugh
when I behold him on Sundays strutting along the churchyard like a
turkey-cock through rows of his parishioners, who bow to him with as
much submission, and are as unregarded, as a set of servile courtiers
by the proudest prince in Christendom. But if such temporal pride is
ridiculous, surely the spiritual is odious and detestable; if such a
puffed--up empty human bladder, strutting in princely robes, justly
moves one's derision, surely in the habit of a priest it must raise
our scorn."

"Doubtless," answered Adams, "your opinion is right; but I hope such
examples are rare. The clergy whom I have the honour to know maintain a
different behaviour; and you will allow me, sir, that the readiness
which too many of the laity show to contemn the order may be one reason
of their avoiding too much humility." "Very true, indeed," says the
gentleman; "I find, sir, you are a man of excellent sense, and am happy
in this opportunity of knowing you; perhaps our accidental meeting may
not be disadvantageous to you neither. At present I shall only say to
you that the incumbent of this living is old and infirm, and that it is
in my gift. Doctor, give me your hand; and assure yourself of it at his
decease." Adams told him, "He was never more confounded in his life than
at his utter incapacity to make any return to such noble and unmerited
generosity." "A mere trifle, sir," cries the gentleman, "scarce worth
your acceptance; a little more than three hundred a year. I wish it was
double the value for your sake." Adams bowed, and cried from the
emotions of his gratitude; when the other asked him, "If he was married,
or had any children, besides those in the spiritual sense he had
mentioned." "Sir," replied the parson, "I have a wife and six at your
service." "That is unlucky," says the gentleman; "for I would otherwise
have taken you into my own house as my chaplain; however, I have another
in the parish (for the parsonage-house is not good enough), which I will
furnish for you. Pray, does your wife understand a dairy?" "I can't
profess she does," says Adams. "I am sorry for it," quoth the gentleman;
"I would have given you half-a-dozen cows, and very good grounds to have
maintained them." "Sir," said Adams, in an ecstasy, "you are too
liberal; indeed you are." "Not at all," cries the gentleman: "I esteem
riches only as they give me an opportunity of doing good; and I never
saw one whom I had a greater inclination to serve." At which words he
shook him heartily by the hand, and told him he had sufficient room in
his house to entertain him and his friends. Adams begged he might give
him no such trouble; that they could be very well accommodated in the
house where they were; forgetting they had not a sixpenny piece among
them. The gentleman would not be denied; and, informing himself how far
they were travelling, he said it was too long a journey to take on foot,
and begged that they would favour him by suffering him to lend them a
servant and horses; adding, withal, that, if they would do him the
pleasure of their company only two days, he would furnish them with his
coach and six. Adams, turning to Joseph, said, "How lucky is this
gentleman's goodness to you, who I am afraid would be scarce able to
hold out on your lame leg!" and then, addressing the person who made him
these liberal promises, after much bowing, he cried out, "Blessed be the
hour which first introduced me to a man of your charity! you are indeed
a Christian of the true primitive kind, and an honour to the country
wherein you live. I would willingly have taken a pilgrimage to the Holy
Land to have beheld you; for the advantages which we draw from your
goodness give me little pleasure, in comparison of what I enjoy for your
own sake when I consider the treasures you are by these means laying up
for yourself in a country that passeth not away. We will therefore, most
generous sir, accept your goodness, as well the entertainment you have
so kindly offered us at your house this evening, as the accommodation of
your horses to-morrow morning." He then began to search for his hat, as
did Joseph for his; and both they and Fanny were in order of departure,
when the gentleman, stopping short, and seeming to meditate by himself
for the space of about a minute, exclaimed thus: "Sure never anything
was so unlucky; I had forgot that my house-keeper was gone abroad, and
hath locked up all my rooms; indeed, I would break them open for you,
but shall not be able to furnish you with a bed; for she has likewise
put away all my linen. I am glad it entered into my head before I had
given you the trouble of walking there; besides, I believe you will find
better accommodations here than you expected.--Landlord, you can provide
good beds for these people, can't you?" "Yes, and please your worship,"
cries the host, "and such as no lord or justice of the peace in the
kingdom need be ashamed to lie in." "I am heartily sorry," says the
gentleman, "for this disappointment. I am resolved I will never suffer
her to carry away the keys again." "Pray, sir, let it not make you
uneasy," cries Adams; "we shall do very well here; and the loan of your
horses is a favour we shall be incapable of making any return to." "Ay!"
said the squire, "the horses shall attend you here at what hour in the
morning you please;" and now, after many civilities too tedious to
enumerate, many squeezes by the hand, with most affectionate looks and
smiles at each other, and after appointing the horses at seven the next
morning, the gentleman took his leave of them, and departed to his own
house. Adams and his companions returned to the table, where the parson
smoaked another pipe, and then they all retired to rest.

Mr Adams rose very early, and called Joseph out of his bed, between whom
a very fierce dispute ensued, whether Fanny should ride behind Joseph,
or behind the gentleman's servant; Joseph insisting on it that he was
perfectly recovered, and was as capable of taking care of Fanny as any
other person could be. But Adams would not agree to it, and declared he
would not trust her behind him; for that he was weaker than he imagined
himself to be.

This dispute continued a long time, and had begun to be very hot, when a
servant arrived from their good friend, to acquaint them that he was
unfortunately prevented from lending them any horses; for that his groom
had, unknown to him, put his whole stable under a course of physic.

This advice presently struck the two disputants dumb: Adams cried out,
"Was ever anything so unlucky as this poor gentleman? I protest I am
more sorry on his account than my own. You see, Joseph, how this
good-natured man is treated by his servants; one locks up his linen,
another physics his horses, and I suppose, by his being at this house
last night, the butler had locked up his cellar. Bless us! how
good-nature is used in this world! I protest I am more concerned on his
account than my own." "So am not I," cries Joseph; "not that I am much
troubled about walking on foot; all my concern is, how we shall get out
of the house, unless God sends another pedlar to redeem us. But
certainly this gentleman has such an affection for you, that he would
lend you a larger sum than we owe here, which is not above four or five
shillings." "Very true, child," answered Adams; "I will write a letter
to him, and will even venture to solicit him for three half-crowns;
there will be no harm in having two or three shillings in our pockets;
as we have full forty miles to travel, we may possibly have occasion for
them."

Fanny being now risen, Joseph paid her a visit, and left Adams to
write his letter, which having finished, he despatched a boy with it to
the gentleman, and then seated himself by the door, lighted his pipe,
and betook himself to meditation.

The boy staying longer than seemed to be necessary, Joseph, who with
Fanny was now returned to the parson, expressed some apprehensions that
the gentleman's steward had locked up his purse too. To which Adams
answered, "It might very possibly be, and he should wonder at no
liberties which the devil might put into the head of a wicked servant
to take with so worthy a master;" but added, "that, as the sum was so
small, so noble a gentleman would be easily able to procure it in the
parish, though he had it not in his own pocket. Indeed," says he, "if
it was four or five guineas, or any such large quantity of money, it
might be a different matter."

They were now sat down to breakfast over some toast and ale, when the
boy returned and informed them that the gentleman was not at home. "Very
well!" cries Adams; "but why, child, did you not stay till his return?
Go back again, my good boy, and wait for his coming home; he cannot be
gone far, as his horses are all sick; and besides, he had no intention
to go abroad, for he invited us to spend this day and tomorrow at his
house. Therefore go back, child, and tarry till his return home." The
messenger departed, and was back again with great expedition, bringing
an account that the gentleman was gone a long journey, and would not be
at home again this month. At these words Adams seemed greatly
confounded, saying, "This must be a sudden accident, as the sickness or
death of a relation or some such unforeseen misfortune;" and then,
turning to Joseph, cried, "I wish you had reminded me to have borrowed
this money last night." Joseph, smiling, answered, "He was very much
deceived if the gentleman would not have found some excuse to avoid
lending it.--I own," says he, "I was never much pleased with his
professing so much kindness for you at first sight; for I have heard the
gentlemen of our cloth in London tell many such stories of their
masters. But when the boy brought the message back of his not being at
home, I presently knew what would follow; for, whenever a man of fashion
doth not care to fulfil his promises, the custom is to order his
servants that he will never be at home to the person so promised. In
London they call it denying him. I have myself denied Sir Thomas Booby
above a hundred times, and when the man hath danced attendance for about
a month or sometimes longer, he is acquainted in the end that the
gentleman is gone out of town and could do nothing in the
business."--"Good Lord!" says Adams, "what wickedness is there in the
Christian world! I profess almost equal to what I have read of the
heathens. But surely, Joseph, your suspicions of this gentleman must be
unjust, for what a silly fellow must he be who would do the devil's work
for nothing! and canst thou tell me any interest he could possibly
propose to himself by deceiving us in his professions?"--"It is not for
me," answered Joseph, "to give reasons for what men do, to a gentleman
of your learning."--"You say right," quoth Adams; "knowledge of men is
only to be learned from books; Plato and Seneca for that; and those are
authors, I am afraid, child, you never read."--"Not I, sir, truly,"
answered Joseph; "all I know is, it is a maxim among the gentlemen of
our cloth, that those masters who promise the most perform the least;
and I have often heard them say they have found the largest vails in
those families where they were not promised any. But, sir, instead of
considering any farther these matters, it would be our wisest way to
contrive some method of getting out of this house; for the generous
gentleman, instead of doing us any service, hath left us the whole
reckoning to pay." Adams was going to answer, when their host came in,
and, with a kind of jeering smile, said, "Well, masters! the squire hath
not sent his horses for you yet. Laud help me! how easily some folks
make promises!"--"How!" says Adams; "have you ever known him do anything
of this kind before?"--"Ay! marry have I," answered the host: "it is no
business of mine, you know, sir, to say anything to a gentleman to his
face; but now he is not here, I will assure you, he hath not his fellow
within the three next market-towns. I own I could not help laughing when
I heard him offer you the living, for thereby hangs a good jest. I
thought he would have offered you my house next, for one is no more his
to dispose of than the other." At these words Adams, blessing himself,
declared, "He had never read of such a monster. But what vexes me most,"
says he, "is, that he hath decoyed us into running up a long debt with
you, which we are not able to pay, for we have no money about us, and,
what is worse, live at such a distance, that if you should trust us, I
am afraid you would lose your money for want of our finding any
conveniency of sending it."--"Trust you, master!" says the host, "that I
will with all my heart. I honour the clergy too much to deny trusting
one of them for such a trifle; besides, I like your fear of never paying
me. I have lost many a debt in my lifetime, but was promised to be paid
them all in a very short time. I will score this reckoning for the
novelty of it. It is the first, I do assure you, of its kind. But what
say you, master, shall we have t'other pot before we part? It will waste
but a little chalk more, and if you never pay me a shilling the loss
will not ruin me." Adams liked the invitation very well, especially as
it was delivered with so hearty an accent. He shook his host by the
hand, and thanking him, said, "He would tarry another pot rather for the
pleasure of such worthy company than for the liquor;" adding, "he was
glad to find some Christians left in the kingdom, for that he almost
began to suspect that he was sojourning in a country inhabited only by
Jews and Turks."

The kind host produced the liquor, and Joseph with Fanny retired into
the garden, where, while they solaced themselves with amorous discourse,
Adams sat down with his host; and, both filling their glasses, and
lighting their pipes, they began that dialogue which the reader will
find in the next chapter.



CHAPTER XVII.

_A dialogue between Mr Abraham Adams and his host, which, by the
disagreement in their opinions, seemed to threaten an unlucky
catastrophe, had it not been timely prevented by the return of
the lovers._


"Sir," said the host, "I assure you you are not the first to whom our
squire hath promised more than he hath performed. He is so famous for
this practice, that his word will not be taken for much by those who
know him. I remember a young fellow whom he promised his parents to make
an exciseman. The poor people, who could ill afford it, bred their son
to writing and accounts, and other learning to qualify him for the
place; and the boy held up his head above his condition with these
hopes; nor would he go to plough, nor to any other kind of work, and
went constantly drest as fine as could be, with two clean Holland shirts
a week, and this for several years; till at last he followed the squire
up to London, thinking there to mind him of his promises; but he could
never get sight of him. So that, being out of money and business, he
fell into evil company and wicked courses; and in the end came to a
sentence of transportation, the news of which broke the mother's
heart.--I will tell you another true story of him. There was a neighbour
of mine, a farmer, who had two sons whom he bred up to the business.
Pretty lads they were. Nothing would serve the squire but that the
youngest must be made a parson. Upon which he persuaded the father to
send him to school, promising that he would afterwards maintain him at
the university, and, when he was of a proper age, give him a living. But
after the lad had been seven years at school, and his father brought him
to the squire, with a letter from his master that he was fit for the
university, the squire, instead of minding his promise, or sending him
thither at his expense, only told his father that the young man was a
fine scholar, and it was pity he could not afford to keep him at Oxford
for four or five years more, by which time, if he could get him a
curacy, he might have him ordained. The farmer said, 'He was not a man
sufficient to do any such thing.'--'Why, then,' answered the squire, 'I
am very sorry you have given him so much learning; for, if he cannot get
his living by that, it will rather spoil him for anything else; and your
other son, who can hardly write his name, will do more at ploughing and
sowing, and is in a better condition, than he.' And indeed so it proved;
for the poor lad, not finding friends to maintain him in his learning,
as he had expected, and being unwilling to work, fell to drinking,
though he was a very sober lad before; and in a short time, partly with
grief, and partly with good liquor, fell into a consumption, and
died.--Nay, I can tell you more still: there was another, a young woman,
and the handsomest in all this neighbourhood, whom he enticed up to
London, promising to make her a gentlewoman to one of your women of
quality; but, instead of keeping his word, we have since heard, after
having a child by her himself, she became a common whore; then kept a
coffeehouse in Covent Garden; and a little after died of the French
distemper in a gaol.--I could tell you many more stories; but how do you
imagine he served me myself? You must know, sir, I was bred a seafaring
man, and have been many voyages; till at last I came to be master of a
ship myself, and was in a fair way of making a fortune, when I was
attacked by one of those cursed guarda-costas who took our ships before
the beginning of the war; and after a fight, wherein I lost the greater
part of my crew, my rigging being all demolished, and two shots received
between wind and water, I was forced to strike. The villains carried off
my ship, a brigantine of 150 tons--a pretty creature she was--and put me,
a man, and a boy, into a little bad pink, in which, with much ado, we at
last made Falmouth; though I believe the Spaniards did not imagine she
could possibly live a day at sea. Upon my return hither, where my wife,
who was of this country, then lived, the squire told me he was so
pleased with the defence I had made against the enemy, that he did not
fear getting me promoted to a lieutenancy of a man-of-war, if I would
accept of it; which I thankfully assured him I would. Well, sir, two or
three years passed, during which I had many repeated promises, not only
from the squire, but (as he told me) from the lords of the admiralty. He
never returned from London but I was assured I might be satisfied now,
for I was certain of the first vacancy; and, what surprizes me still,
when I reflect on it, these assurances were given me with no less
confidence, after so many disappointments, than at first. At last, sir,
growing weary, and somewhat suspicious, after so much delay, I wrote to
a friend in London, who I knew had some acquaintance at the best house
in the admiralty, and desired him to back the squire's interest; for
indeed I feared he had solicited the affair with more coldness than he
pretended. And what answer do you think my friend sent me? Truly, sir,
he acquainted me that the squire had never mentioned my name at the
admiralty in his life; and, unless I had much faithfuller interest,
advised me to give over my pretensions; which I immediately did, and,
with the concurrence of my wife, resolved to set up an alehouse, where
you are heartily welcome; and so my service to you; and may the squire,
and all such sneaking rascals, go to the devil together."--"O fie!" says
Adams, "O fie! He is indeed a wicked man; but G-- will, I hope, turn his
heart to repentance. Nay, if he could but once see the meanness of this
detestable vice; would he but once reflect that he is one of the most
scandalous as well as pernicious lyars; sure he must despise himself to
so intolerable a degree, that it would be impossible for him to continue
a moment in such a course. And to confess the truth, notwithstanding the
baseness of this character, which he hath too well deserved, he hath in
his countenance sufficient symptoms of that _bona indoles_, that
sweetness of disposition, which furnishes out a good Christian."--"Ah,
master! master!" says the host, "if you had travelled as far as I have,
and conversed with the many nations where I have traded, you would not
give any credit to a man's countenance. Symptoms in his countenance,
quotha! I would look there, perhaps, to see whether a man had the
small-pox, but for nothing else." He spoke this with so little regard to
the parson's observation, that it a good deal nettled him; and, taking
the pipe hastily from his mouth, he thus answered: "Master of mine,
perhaps I have travelled a great deal farther than you without the
assistance of a ship. Do you imagine sailing by different cities or
countries is travelling? No.

    "Caelum non animum mutant qui trans mare currunt.

"I can go farther in an afternoon than you in a twelvemonth. What, I
suppose you have seen the Pillars of Hercules, and perhaps the walls of
Carthage. Nay, you may have heard Scylla, and seen Charybdis; you may
have entered the closet where Archimedes was found at the taking of
Syracuse. I suppose you have sailed among the Cyclades, and passed the
famous straits which take their name from the unfortunate Helle, whose
fate is sweetly described by Apollonius Rhodius; you have passed the
very spot, I conceive, where Daedalus fell into that sea, his waxen
wings being melted by the sun; you have traversed the Euxine sea, I make
no doubt; nay, you may have been on the banks of the Caspian, and called
at Colchis, to see if there is ever another golden fleece." "Not I,
truly, master," answered the host: "I never touched at any of these
places."--"But I have been at all these," replied Adams. "Then, I
suppose," cries the host, "you have been at the East Indies; for there
are no such, I will be sworn, either in the West or the Levant."--"Pray
where's the Levant?" quoth Adams; "that should be in the East Indies by
right." "Oho! you are a pretty traveller," cries the host, "and not know
the Levant! My service to you, master; you must not talk of these things
with me! you must not tip us the traveller; it won't go here." "Since
thou art so dull to misunderstand me still," quoth Adams, "I will inform
thee; the travelling I mean is in books, the only way of travelling by
which any knowledge is to be acquired. From them I learn what I asserted
just now, that nature generally imprints such a portraiture of the mind
in the countenance, that a skilful physiognomist will rarely be
deceived. I presume you have never read the story of Socrates to this
purpose, and therefore I will tell it you. A certain physiognomist
asserted of Socrates, that he plainly discovered by his features that he
was a rogue in his nature. A character so contrary to the tenour of all
this great man's actions, and the generally received opinion concerning
him, incensed the boys of Athens so that they threw stones at the
physiognomist, and would have demolished him for his ignorance, had not
Socrates himself prevented them by confessing the truth of his
observations, and acknowledging that, though he corrected his
disposition by philosophy, he was indeed naturally as inclined to vice
as had been predicated of him. Now, pray resolve me--How should a man
know this story if he had not read it?" "Well, master," said the host,
"and what signifies it whether a man knows it or no? He who goes abroad,
as I have done, will always have opportunities enough of knowing the
world without troubling his head with Socrates, or any such fellows."
"Friend," cries Adams, "if a man should sail round the world, and anchor
in every harbour of it, without learning, he would return home as
ignorant as he went out." "Lord help you!" answered the host; "there was
my boatswain, poor fellow! he could scarce either write or read, and yet
he would navigate a ship with any master of a man-of-war; and a very
pretty knowledge of trade he had too." "Trade," answered Adams, "as
Aristotle proves in his first chapter of Politics, is below a
philosopher, and unnatural as it is managed now." The host looked
stedfastly at Adams, and after a minute's silence asked him, "If he was
one of the writers of the Gazetteers? for I have heard," says he, "they
are writ by parsons." "Gazetteers!" answered Adams, "what is that?" "It
is a dirty newspaper," replied the host, "which hath been given away all
over the nation for these many years, to abuse trade and honest men,
which I would not suffer to lye on my table, though it hath been offered
me for nothing." "Not I truly," said Adams; "I never write anything but
sermons; and I assure you I am no enemy to trade, whilst it is
consistent with honesty; nay, I have always looked on the tradesman as a
very valuable member of society, and, perhaps, inferior to none but the
man of learning." "No, I believe he is not, nor to him neither,"
answered the host. "Of what use would learning be in a country without
trade? What would all you parsons do to clothe your backs and feed your
bellies? Who fetches you your silks, and your linens, and your wines,
and all the other necessaries of life? I speak chiefly with regard to
the sailors." "You should say the extravagancies of life," replied the
parson; "but admit they were the necessaries, there is something more
necessary than life itself, which is provided by learning; I mean the
learning of the clergy. Who clothes you with piety, meekness, humility,
charity, patience, and all the other Christian virtues? Who feeds your
souls with the milk of brotherly love, and diets them with all the
dainty food of holiness, which at once cleanses them of all impure
carnal affections, and fattens them with the truly rich spirit of grace?
Who doth this?" "Ay, who, indeed?" cries the host; "for I do not
remember ever to have seen any such clothing or such feeding. And so, in
the mean time, master, my service to you." Adams was going to answer
with some severity, when Joseph and Fanny returned and pressed his
departure so eagerly that he would not refuse them; and so, grasping his
crabstick, he took leave of his host (neither of them being so well
pleased with each other as they had been at their first sitting down
together), and with Joseph and Fanny, who both expressed much
impatience, departed, and now all together renewed their journey.




BOOK III.



CHAPTER I.

_Matter prefatory in praise of biography._


Notwithstanding the preference which may be vulgarly given to the
authority of those romance writers who entitle their books "the History
of England, the History of France, of Spain, &c.," it is most certain
that truth is to be found only in the works of those who celebrate the
lives of great men, and are commonly called biographers, as the others
should indeed be termed topographers, or chorographers; words which
might well mark the distinction between them; it being the business of
the latter chiefly to describe countries and cities, which, with the
assistance of maps, they do pretty justly, and may be depended upon; but
as to the actions and characters of men, their writings are not quite so
authentic, of which there needs no other proof than those eternal
contradictions occurring between two topographers who undertake the
history of the same country: for instance, between my Lord Clarendon and
Mr Whitelocke, between Mr Echard and Rapin, and many others; where,
facts being set forth in a different light, every reader believes as he
pleases; and, indeed, the more judicious and suspicious very justly
esteem the whole as no other than a romance, in which the writer hath
indulged a happy and fertile invention. But though these widely differ
in the narrative of facts; some ascribing victory to the one, and others
to the other party; some representing the same man as a rogue, while
others give him a great and honest character; yet all agree in the scene
where the fact is supposed to have happened, and where the person, who
is both a rogue and an honest man, lived. Now with us biographers the
case is different; the facts we deliver may be relied on, though we
often mistake the age and country wherein they happened: for, though it
may be worth the examination of critics, whether the shepherd
Chrysostom, who, as Cervantes informs us, died for love of the fair
Marcella, who hated him, was ever in Spain, will any one doubt but that
such a silly fellow hath really existed? Is there in the world such a
sceptic as to disbelieve the madness of Cardenio, the perfidy of
Ferdinand, the impertinent curiosity of Anselmo, the weakness of
Camilla, the irresolute friendship of Lothario? though perhaps, as to
the time and place where those several persons lived, that good
historian may be deplorably deficient. But the most known instance of
this kind is in the true history of Gil Blas, where the inimitable
biographer hath made a notorious blunder in the country of Dr Sangrado,
who used his patients as a vintner doth his wine-vessels, by letting out
their blood, and filling them up with water. Doth not every one, who is
the least versed in physical history, know that Spain was not the
country in which this doctor lived? The same writer hath likewise erred
in the country of his archbishop, as well as that of those great
personages whose understandings were too sublime to taste anything but
tragedy, and in many others. The same mistakes may likewise be observed
in Scarron, the Arabian Nights, the History of Marianne and le Paisan
Parvenu, and perhaps some few other writers of this class, whom I have
not read, or do not at present recollect; for I would by no means be
thought to comprehend those persons of surprizing genius, the authors of
immense romances, or the modern novel and Atalantis writers; who,
without any assistance from nature or history, record persons who never
were, or will be, and facts which never did, nor possibly can, happen;
whose heroes are of their own creation, and their brains the chaos
whence all their materials are selected. Not that such writers deserve
no honour; so far otherwise, that perhaps they merit the highest; for
what can be nobler than to be as an example of the wonderful extent of
human genius? One may apply to them what Balzac says of Aristotle, that
they are a second nature (for they have no communication with the first;
by which, authors of an inferior class, who cannot stand alone, are
obliged to support themselves as with crutches); but these of whom I am
now speaking seem to be possessed of those stilts, which the excellent
Voltaire tells us, in his letters, "carry the genius far off, but with
an regular pace." Indeed, far out of the sight of the reader,

    Beyond the realm of Chaos and old Night.

But to return to the former class, who are contented to copy nature,
instead of forming originals from the confused heap of matter in their
own brains, is not such a book as that which records the achievements of
the renowned Don Quixote more worthy the name of a history than even
Mariana's: for, whereas the latter is confined to a particular period of
time, and to a particular nation, the former is the history of the world
in general, at least that part which is polished by laws, arts, and
sciences; and of that from the time it was first polished to this day;
nay, and forwards as long as it shall so remain?

I shall now proceed to apply these observations to the work before us;
for indeed I have set them down principally to obviate some
constructions which the good nature of mankind, who are always forward
to see their friends' virtues recorded, may put to particular parts. I
question not but several of my readers will know the lawyer in the
stage-coach the moment they hear his voice. It is likewise odds but the
wit and the prude meet with some of their acquaintance, as well as all
the rest of my characters. To prevent, therefore, any such malicious
applications, I declare here, once for all, I describe not men, but
manners; not an individual, but a species. Perhaps it will be answered,
Are not the characters then taken from life? To which I answer in the
affirmative; nay, I believe I might aver that I have writ little more
than I have seen. The lawyer is not only alive, but hath been so these
four thousand years; and I hope G-- will indulge his life as many yet to
come. He hath not indeed confined himself to one profession, one
religion, or one country; but when the first mean selfish creature
appeared on the human stage, who made self the centre of the whole
creation, would give himself no pain, incur no danger, advance no money,
to assist or preserve his fellow-creatures; then was our lawyer born;
and, whilst such a person as I have described exists on earth, so long
shall he remain upon it. It is, therefore, doing him little honour to
imagine he endeavours to mimick some little obscure fellow, because he
happens to resemble him in one particular feature, or perhaps in his
profession; whereas his appearance in the world is calculated for much
more general and noble purposes; not to expose one pitiful wretch to the
small and contemptible circle of his acquaintance; but to hold the glass
to thousands in their closets, that they may contemplate their
deformity, and endeavour to reduce it, and thus by suffering private
mortification may avoid public shame. This places the boundary between,
and distinguishes the satirist from the libeller: for the former
privately corrects the fault for the benefit of the person, like a
parent; the latter publickly exposes the person himself, as an example
to others, like an executioner.

There are besides little circumstances to be considered; as the drapery
of a picture, which though fashion varies at different times, the
resemblance of the countenance is not by those means diminished. Thus I
believe we may venture to say Mrs Tow-wouse is coeval with our lawyer:
and, though perhaps, during the changes which so long an existence must
have passed through, she may in her turn have stood behind the bar at an
inn, I will not scruple to affirm she hath likewise in the revolution of
ages sat on a throne. In short, where extreme turbulency of temper,
avarice, and an insensibility of human misery, with a degree of
hypocrisy, have united in a female composition, Mrs Tow-wouse was that
woman; and where a good inclination, eclipsed by a poverty of spirit and
understanding, hath glimmered forth in a man, that man hath been no
other than her sneaking husband.

I shall detain my reader no longer than to give him one caution more of
an opposite kind: for, as in most of our particular characters we mean
not to lash individuals, but all of the like sort, so, in our general
descriptions, we mean not universals, but would be understood with many
exceptions: for instance, in our description of high people, we cannot
be intended to include such as, whilst they are an honour to their high
rank, by a well-guided condescension make their superiority as easy as
possible to those whom fortune chiefly hath placed below them. Of this
number I could name a peer no less elevated by nature than by fortune;
who, whilst he wears the noblest ensigns of honour on his person, bears
the truest stamp of dignity on his mind, adorned with greatness,
enriched with knowledge, and embellished with genius. I have seen this
man relieve with generosity, while he hath conversed with freedom, and
be to the same person a patron and a companion. I could name a commoner,
raised higher above the multitude by superior talents than is in the
power of his prince to exalt him, whose behaviour to those he hath
obliged is more amiable than the obligation itself; and who is so great
a master of affability, that, if he could divest himself of an inherent
greatness in his manner, would often make the lowest of his acquaintance
forget who was the master of that palace in which they are so
courteously entertained. These are pictures which must be, I believe,
known: I declare they are taken from the life, and not intended to
exceed it. By those high people, therefore, whom I have described, I
mean a set of wretches, who, while they are a disgrace to their
ancestors, whose honours and fortunes they inherit (or perhaps a greater
to their mother, for such degeneracy is scarce credible), have the
insolence to treat those with disregard who are at least equal to the
founders of their own splendor. It is, I fancy, impossible to conceive a
spectacle more worthy of our indignation, than that of a fellow, who is
not only a blot in the escutcheon of a great family, but a scandal to
the human species, maintaining a supercilious behaviour to men who are
an honour to their nature and a disgrace to their fortune.

And now, reader, taking these hints along with you, you may, if you
please, proceed to the sequel of this our true history.



CHAPTER II.

_A night scene, wherein several wonderful adventures befel Adams and his
fellow-travellers._


It was so late when our travellers left the inn or alehouse (for it
might be called either), that they had not travelled many miles before
night overtook them, or met them, which you please. The reader must
excuse me if I am not particular as to the way they took; for, as we are
now drawing near the seat of the Boobies, and as that is a ticklish
name, which malicious persons may apply, according to their evil
inclinations, to several worthy country squires, a race of men whom we
look upon as entirely inoffensive, and for whom we have an adequate
regard, we shall lend no assistance to any such malicious purposes.

Darkness had now overspread the hemisphere, when Fanny whispered Joseph
"that she begged to rest herself a little; for that she was so tired
she could walk no farther." Joseph immediately prevailed with parson
Adams, who was as brisk as a bee, to stop. He had no sooner seated
himself than he lamented the loss of his dear Aeschylus; but was a
little comforted when reminded that, if he had it in his possession, he
could not see to read.

The sky was so clouded, that not a star appeared. It was indeed,
according to Milton, darkness visible. This was a circumstance, however,
very favourable to Joseph; for Fanny, not suspicious of being overseen
by Adams, gave a loose to her passion which she had never done before,
and, reclining her head on his bosom, threw her arm carelessly round
him, and suffered him to lay his cheek close to hers. All this infused
such happiness into Joseph, that he would not have changed his turf for
the finest down in the finest palace in the universe.

Adams sat at some distance from the lovers, and, being unwilling to
disturb them, applied himself to meditation; in which he had not
spent much time before he discovered a light at some distance that
seemed approaching towards him. He immediately hailed it; but, to his
sorrow and surprize, it stopped for a moment, and then disappeared.
He then called to Joseph, asking him, "if he had not seen the light?"
Joseph answered, "he had."--"And did you not mark how it vanished?"
returned he: "though I am not afraid of ghosts, I do not absolutely
disbelieve them."

He then entered into a meditation on those unsubstantial beings; which
was soon interrupted by several voices, which he thought almost at his
elbow, though in fact they were not so extremely near. However, he could
distinctly hear them agree on the murder of any one they met; and a
little after heard one of them say, "he had killed a dozen since that
day fortnight."

Adams now fell on his knees, and committed himself to the care of
Providence; and poor Fanny, who likewise heard those terrible words,
embraced Joseph so closely, that had not he, whose ears were also open,
been apprehensive on her account, he would have thought no danger which
threatened only himself too dear a price for such embraces.

Joseph now drew forth his penknife, and Adams, having finished his
ejaculations, grasped his crab-stick, his only weapon, and, coming up to
Joseph, would have had him quit Fanny, and place her in the rear; but
his advice was fruitless; she clung closer to him, not at all regarding
the presence of Adams, and in a soothing voice declared, "she would die
in his arms." Joseph, clasping her with inexpressible eagerness,
whispered her, "that he preferred death in hers to life out of them."
Adams, brandishing his crabstick, said, "he despised death as much as
any man," and then repeated aloud--

    "Est hic, est animus lucis contemptor et illum,
    Qui vita bene credat emi quo tendis, honorem."

Upon this the voices ceased for a moment, and then one of them called
out, "D--n you, who is there?" To which Adams was prudent enough to make
no reply; and of a sudden he observed half-a-dozen lights, which seemed
to rise all at once from the ground and advance briskly towards him.
This he immediately concluded to be an apparition; and now, beginning to
conceive that the voices were of the same kind, he called out, "In the
name of the L--d, what wouldst thou have?" He had no sooner spoke than
he heard one of the voices cry out, "D--n them, here they come;" and
soon after heard several hearty blows, as if a number of men had been
engaged at quarterstaff. He was just advancing towards the place of
combat, when Joseph, catching him by the skirts, begged him that they
might take the opportunity of the dark to convey away Fanny from the
danger which threatened her. He presently complied, and, Joseph lifting
up Fanny, they all three made the best of their way; and without looking
behind them, or being overtaken, they had travelled full two miles, poor
Fanny not once complaining of being tired, when they saw afar off
several lights scattered at a small distance from each other, and at the
same time found themselves on the descent of a very steep hill. Adams's
foot slipping, he instantly disappeared, which greatly frightened both
Joseph and Fanny: indeed, if the light had permitted them to see it,
they would scarce have refrained laughing to see the parson rolling down
the hill; which he did from top to bottom, without receiving any harm.
He then hollowed as loud as he could, to inform them of his safety, and
relieve them from the fears which they had conceived for him. Joseph and
Fanny halted some time, considering what to do; at last they advanced a
few paces, where the declivity seemed least steep; and then Joseph,
taking his Fanny in his arms, walked firmly down the hill, without
making a false step, and at length landed her at the bottom, where Adams
soon came to them.

Learn hence, my fair countrywomen, to consider your own weakness, and
the many occasions on which the strength of a man may be useful to you;
and, duly weighing this, take care that you match not yourselves with
the spindle-shanked beaus and _petit-maîtres_ of the age, who, instead
of being able, like Joseph Andrews, to carry you in lusty arms through
the rugged ways and downhill steeps of life, will rather want to support
their feeble limbs with your strength and assistance.

Our travellers now moved forwards where the nearest light presented
itself; and, having crossed a common field, they came to a meadow, where
they seemed to be at a very little distance from the light, when, to
their grief, they arrived at the banks of a river. Adams here made a
full stop, and declared he could swim, but doubted how it was possible
to get Fanny over: to which Joseph answered, "If they walked along its
banks, they might be certain of soon finding a bridge, especially as by
the number of lights they might be assured a parish was near." "Odso,
that's true indeed," said Adams; "I did not think of that."

Accordingly, Joseph's advice being taken, they passed over two meadows,
and came to a little orchard, which led them to a house. Fanny begged of
Joseph to knock at the door, assuring him "she was so weary that she
could hardly stand on her feet." Adams, who was foremost, performed this
ceremony; and, the door being immediately opened, a plain kind of man
appeared at it: Adams acquainted him "that they had a young woman with
them who was so tired with her journey that he should be much obliged to
him if he would suffer her to come in and rest herself." The man, who
saw Fanny by the light of the candle which he held in his hand,
perceiving her innocent and modest look, and having no apprehensions
from the civil behaviour of Adams, presently answered, "That the young
woman was very welcome to rest herself in his house, and so were her
company." He then ushered them into a very decent room, where his wife
was sitting at a table: she immediately rose up, and assisted them in
setting forth chairs, and desired them to sit down; which they had no
sooner done than the man of the house asked them if they would have
anything to refresh themselves with? Adams thanked him, and answered he
should be obliged to him for a cup of his ale, which was likewise chosen
by Joseph and Fanny. Whilst he was gone to fill a very large jug with
this liquor, his wife told Fanny she seemed greatly fatigued, and
desired her to take something stronger than ale; but she refused with
many thanks, saying it was true she was very much tired, but a little
rest she hoped would restore her. As soon as the company were all
seated, Mr Adams, who had filled himself with ale, and by public
permission had lighted his pipe, turned to the master of the house,
asking him, "If evil spirits did not use to walk in that neighbourhood?"
To which receiving no answer, he began to inform him of the adventure
which they met with on the downs; nor had he proceeded far in the story
when somebody knocked very hard at the door. The company expressed some
amazement, and Fanny and the good woman turned pale: her husband went
forth, and whilst he was absent, which was some time, they all remained
silent, looking at one another, and heard several voices discoursing
pretty loudly. Adams was fully persuaded that spirits were abroad, and
began to meditate some exorcisms; Joseph a little inclined to the same
opinion; Fanny was more afraid of men; and the good woman herself began
to suspect her guests, and imagined those without were rogues belonging
to their gang. At length the master of the house returned, and,
laughing, told Adams he had discovered his apparition; that the
murderers were sheep-stealers, and the twelve persons murdered were no
other than twelve sheep; adding, that the shepherds had got the better
of them, had secured two, and were proceeding with them to a justice of
peace. This account greatly relieved the fears of the whole company; but
Adams muttered to himself, "He was convinced of the truth of apparitions
for all that."

They now sat chearfully round the fire, till the master of the house,
having surveyed his guests, and conceiving that the cassock, which,
having fallen down, appeared under Adams's greatcoat, and the shabby
livery on Joseph Andrews, did not well suit with the familiarity
between them, began to entertain some suspicions not much to their
advantage: addressing himself therefore to Adams, he said, "He
perceived he was a clergyman by his dress, and supposed that honest man
was his footman." "Sir," answered Adams, "I am a clergyman at your
service; but as to that young man, whom you have rightly termed honest,
he is at present in nobody's service; he never lived in any other
family than that of Lady Booby, from whence he was discharged, I assure
you, for no crime." Joseph said, "He did not wonder the gentleman was
surprized to see one of Mr Adams's character condescend to so much
goodness with a poor man."--"Child," said Adams, "I should be ashamed
of my cloth if I thought a poor man, who is honest, below my notice or
my familiarity. I know not how those who think otherwise can profess
themselves followers and servants of Him who made no distinction,
unless, peradventure, by preferring the poor to the rich.--Sir," said
he, addressing himself to the gentleman, "these two poor young people
are my parishioners, and I look on them and love them as my children.
There is something singular enough in their history, but I have not now
time to recount it." The master of the house, notwithstanding the
simplicity which discovered itself in Adams, knew too much of the world
to give a hasty belief to professions. He was not yet quite certain
that Adams had any more of the clergyman in him than his cassock. To
try him therefore further, he asked him, "If Mr Pope had lately
published anything new?" Adams answered, "He had heard great
commendations of that poet, but that he had never read nor knew any of
his works."--"Ho! ho!" says the gentleman to himself, "have I caught
you? What!" said he, "have you never seen his Homer?" Adams answered,
"he had never read any translation of the classicks." "Why, truly,"
reply'd the gentleman, "there is a dignity in the Greek language which
I think no modern tongue can reach."--"Do you understand Greek, sir?"
said Adams hastily. "A little, sir," answered the gentleman. "Do you
know, sir," cry'd Adams, "where I can buy an Aeschylus? an unlucky
misfortune lately happened to mine." Aeschylus was beyond the
gentleman, though he knew him very well by name; he therefore,
returning back to Homer, asked Adams, "What part of the Iliad he
thought most excellent?" Adams returned, "His question would be
properer, What kind of beauty was the chief in poetry? for that Homer
was equally excellent in them all. And, indeed," continued he, "what
Cicero says of a complete orator may well be applied to a great poet:
'He ought to comprehend all perfections.' Homer did this in the most
excellent degree; it is not without reason, therefore, that the
philosopher, in the twenty-second chapter of his Poeticks, mentions him
by no other appellation than that of the Poet. He was the father of the
drama as well as the epic; not of tragedy only, but of comedy also; for
his Margites, which is deplorably lost, bore, says Aristotle, the same
analogy to comedy as his Odyssey and Iliad to tragedy. To him,
therefore, we owe Aristophanes as well as Euripides, Sophocles, and my
poor Aeschylus. But if you please we will confine ourselves (at least
for the present) to the Iliad, his noblest work; though neither
Aristotle nor Horace give it the preference, as I remember, to the
Odyssey. First, then, as to his subject, can anything be more simple,
and at the same time more noble? He is rightly praised by the first of
those judicious critics for not chusing the whole war, which, though he
says it hath a complete beginning and end, would have been too great
for the understanding to comprehend at one view. I have, therefore,
often wondered why so correct a writer as Horace should, in his epistle
to Lollius, call him the Trojani Belli Scriptorem. Secondly, his
action, termed by Aristotle, Pragmaton Systasis; is it possible for the
mind of man to conceive an idea of such perfect unity, and at the same
time so replete with greatness? And here I must observe, what I do not
remember to have seen noted by any, the Harmotton, that agreement of
his action to his subject: for, as the subject is anger, how agreeable
is his action, which is war; from which every incident arises and to
which every episode immediately relates. Thirdly, his manners, which
Aristotle places second in his description of the several parts of
tragedy, and which he says are included in the action; I am at a loss
whether I should rather admire the exactness of his judgment in the
nice distinction or the immensity of his imagination in their variety.
For, as to the former of these, how accurately is the sedate, injured
resentment of Achilles, distinguished from the hot, insulting passion
of Agamemnon! How widely doth the brutal courage of Ajax differ from
the amiable bravery of Diomedes; and the wisdom of Nestor, which is the
result of long reflection and experience, from the cunning of Ulysses,
the effect of art and subtlety only! If we consider their variety, we
may cry out, with Aristotle in his 24th chapter, that no part of this
divine poem is destitute of manners. Indeed, I might affirm that there
is scarce a character in human nature untouched in some part or other.
And, as there is no passion which he is not able to describe, so is
there none in his reader which he cannot raise. If he hath any superior
excellence to the rest, I have been inclined to fancy it is in the
pathetic. I am sure I never read with dry eyes the two episodes where
Andromache is introduced in the former lamenting the danger, and in the
latter the death, of Hector. The images are so extremely tender in
these, that I am convinced the poet had the worthiest and best heart
imaginable. Nor can I help observing how Sophocles falls short of the
beauties of the original, in that imitation of the dissuasive speech of
Andromache which he hath put into the mouth of Tecmessa. And yet
Sophocles was the greatest genius who ever wrote tragedy; nor have any
of his successors in that art, that is to say, neither Euripides nor
Seneca the tragedian, been able to come near him. As to his sentiments
and diction, I need say nothing; the former are particularly remarkable
for the utmost perfection on that head, namely, propriety; and as to
the latter, Aristotle, whom doubtless you have read over and over, is
very diffuse. I shall mention but one thing more, which that great
critic in his division of tragedy calls Opsis, or the scenery; and
which is as proper to the epic as to the drama, with this difference,
that in the former it falls to the share of the poet, and in the latter
to that of the painter. But did ever painter imagine a scene like that
in the 13th and 14th Iliads? where the reader sees at one view the
prospect of Troy, with the army drawn up before it; the Grecian army,
camp, and fleet; Jupiter sitting on Mount Ida, with his head wrapt in a
cloud, and a thunderbolt in his hand, looking towards Thrace; Neptune
driving through the sea, which divides on each side to permit his
passage, and then seating himself on Mount Samos; the heavens opened,
and the deities all seated on their thrones. This is sublime! This is
poetry!" Adams then rapt out a hundred Greek verses, and with such a
voice, emphasis, and action, that he almost frightened the women; and
as for the gentleman, he was so far from entertaining any further
suspicion of Adams, that he now doubted whether he had not a bishop in
his house. He ran into the most extravagant encomiums on his learning;
and the goodness of his heart began to dilate to all the strangers. He
said he had great compassion for the poor young woman, who looked pale
and faint with her journey; and in truth he conceived a much higher
opinion of her quality than it deserved. He said he was sorry he could
not accommodate them all; but if they were contented with his fireside,
he would sit up with the men; and the young woman might, if she
pleased, partake his wife's bed, which he advised her to; for that they
must walk upwards of a mile to any house of entertainment, and that not
very good neither. Adams, who liked his seat, his ale, his tobacco, and
his company, persuaded Fanny to accept this kind proposal, in which
sollicitation he was seconded by Joseph. Nor was she very difficultly
prevailed on; for she had slept little the last night and not at all
the preceding; so that love itself was scarce able to keep her eyes
open any longer. The offer, therefore, being kindly accepted, the good
woman produced everything eatable in her house on the table, and the
guests, being heartily invited, as heartily regaled themselves,
especially parson Adams. As to the other two, they were examples of the
truth of that physical observation, that love, like other sweet things,
is no whetter of the stomach.

Supper was no sooner ended, than Fanny at her own request retired, and
the good woman bore her company. The man of the house, Adams, and
Joseph, who would modestly have withdrawn, had not the gentleman
insisted on the contrary, drew round the fireside, where Adams (to use
his own words) replenished his pipe, and the gentleman produced a bottle
of excellent beer, being the best liquor in his house.

The modest behaviour of Joseph, with the gracefulness of his person, the
character which Adams gave of him, and the friendship he seemed to
entertain for him, began to work on the gentleman's affections, and
raised in him a curiosity to know the singularity which Adams had
mentioned in his history. This curiosity Adams was no sooner informed of
than, with Joseph's consent, he agreed to gratify it; and accordingly
related all he knew, with as much tenderness as was possible for the
character of Lady Booby; and concluded with the long, faithful, and
mutual passion between him and Fanny, not concealing the meanness of her
birth and education. These latter circumstances entirely cured a
jealousy which had lately risen in the gentleman's mind, that Fanny was
the daughter of some person of fashion, and that Joseph had run away
with her, and Adams was concerned in the plot. He was now enamoured of
his guests, drank their healths with great chearfulness, and returned
many thanks to Adams, who had spent much breath, for he was a
circumstantial teller of a story.

Adams told him it was now in his power to return that favour; for his
extraordinary goodness, as well as that fund of literature he was master
of,[A] which he did not expect to find under such a roof, had raised in
him more curiosity than he had ever known. "Therefore," said he, "if it
be not too troublesome, sir, your history, if you please."

[A] The author hath by some been represented to have made a blunder
    here: for Adams had indeed shown some learning (say they), perhaps
    all the author had; but the gentleman hath shown none, unless his
    approbation of Mr Adams be such: but surely it would be preposterous
    in him to call it so. I have, however, notwithstanding this
    criticism, which I am told came from the mouth of a great orator in
    a public coffee-house, left this blunder as it stood in the first
    edition. I will not have the vanity to apply to anything in this
    work the observation which M. Dacier makes in her preface to her
    Aristophanes: _Je tiens pour une maxime constante, qu'une beauté
    mediocré plait plus généralement qu'une beauté sans défaut._ Mr
    Congreve hath made such another blunder in his Love for Love, where
    Tattle tells Miss Prue, "She should admire him as much for the
    beauty he commends in her as if he himself was possessed of it."

The gentleman answered, he could not refuse him what he had so much
right to insist on; and after some of the common apologies, which are
the usual preface to a story, he thus began.



CHAPTER III.

_In which the gentleman relates the history of his life._


Sir, I am descended of a good family, and was born a gentleman. My
education was liberal, and at a public school, in which I proceeded so
far as to become master of the Latin, and to be tolerably versed in the
Greek language. My father died when I was sixteen, and left me master of
myself. He bequeathed me a moderate fortune, which he intended I should
not receive till I attained the age of twenty-five: for he constantly
asserted that was full early enough to give up any man entirely to the
guidance of his own discretion. However, as this intention was so
obscurely worded in his will that the lawyers advised me to contest the
point with my trustees, I own I paid so little regard to the
inclinations of my dead father, which were sufficiently certain to me,
that I followed their advice, and soon succeeded, for the trustees did
not contest the matter very obstinately on their side. "Sir," said
Adams, "may I crave the favour of your name?" The gentleman answered his
name was Wilson, and then proceeded.

I stayed a very little while at school after his death; for, being a
forward youth, I was extremely impatient to be in the world, for which I
thought my parts, knowledge, and manhood thoroughly qualified me. And to
this early introduction into life, without a guide, I impute all my
future misfortunes; for, besides the obvious mischiefs which attend
this, there is one which hath not been so generally observed: the first
impression which mankind receives of you will be very difficult to
eradicate. How unhappy, therefore, must it be to fix your character in
life, before you can possibly know its value, or weigh the consequences
of those actions which are to establish your future reputation!

A little under seventeen I left my school, and went to London with no
more than six pounds in my pocket; a great sum, as I then conceived; and
which I was afterwards surprized to find so soon consumed.

The character I was ambitious of attaining was that of a fine gentleman;
the first requisites to which I apprehended were to be supplied by a
taylor, a periwig-maker, and some few more tradesmen, who deal in
furnishing out the human body. Notwithstanding the lowness of my purse,
I found credit with them more easily than I expected, and was soon
equipped to my wish. This I own then agreeably surprized me; but I have
since learned that it is a maxim among many tradesmen at the polite end
of the town to deal as largely as they can, reckon as high as they can,
and arrest as soon as they can.

The next qualifications, namely, dancing, fencing, riding the great
horse, and music, came into my head: but, as they required expense and
time, I comforted myself, with regard to dancing, that I had learned a
little in my youth, and could walk a minuet genteelly enough; as to
fencing, I thought my good-humour would preserve me from the danger of a
quarrel; as to the horse, I hoped it would not be thought of; and for
music, I imagined I could easily acquire the reputation of it; for I had
heard some of my schoolfellows pretend to knowledge in operas, without
being able to sing or play on the fiddle.

Knowledge of the town seemed another ingredient; this I thought I should
arrive at by frequenting public places. Accordingly I paid constant
attendance to them all; by which means I was soon master of the
fashionable phrases, learned to cry up the fashionable diversions, and
knew the names and faces of the most fashionable men and women.

Nothing now seemed to remain but an intrigue, which I was resolved to
have immediately; I mean the reputation of it; and indeed I was so
successful, that in a very short time I had half-a-dozen with the finest
women in town.

At these words Adams fetched a deep groan, and then, blessing himself,
cried out, "Good Lord! what wicked times these are!"

Not so wicked as you imagine, continued the gentleman; for I assure you
they were all vestal virgins for anything which I knew to the contrary.
The reputation of intriguing with them was all I sought, and was what I
arrived at: and perhaps I only flattered myself even in that; for very
probably the persons to whom I showed their billets knew as well as I
that they were counterfeits, and that I had written them to myself.
"Write letters to yourself!" said Adams, staring. O sir, answered the
gentleman, it is the very error of the times. Half our modern plays have
one of these characters in them. It is incredible the pains I have
taken, and the absurd methods I employed, to traduce the character of
women of distinction. When another had spoken in raptures of any one, I
have answered, "D--n her, she! We shall have her at H----d's very soon."
When he hath replied, "He thought her virtuous," I have answered, "Ay,
thou wilt always think a woman virtuous, till she is in the streets; but
you and I, Jack or Tom (turning to another in company), know better." At
which I have drawn a paper out of my pocket, perhaps a taylor's bill,
and kissed it, crying at the same time, "By Gad I was once fond of her."

"Proceed, if you please, but do not swear any more," said Adams.

Sir, said the gentleman, I ask your pardon. Well, sir, in this course of
life I continued full three years.--"What course of life?" answered
Adams; "I do not remember you have mentioned any."--Your remark is just,
said the gentleman, smiling; I should rather have said, in this course
of doing nothing. I remember some time afterwards I wrote the journal of
one day, which would serve, I believe, as well for any other during the
whole time. I will endeavour to repeat it to you.

In the morning I arose, took my great stick, and walked out in my green
frock, with my hair in papers (a groan from Adams), and sauntered about
till ten. Went to the auction; told lady ---- she had a dirty face;
laughed heartily at something captain ---- said, I can't remember what,
for I did not very well hear it; whispered lord ----; bowed to the duke
of ----; and was going to bid for a snuff-box, but did not, for fear I
should have had it.

    From  2 to 4, drest myself.  _A groan._
          4 to 6, dined.         _A groan._
          6 to 8, coffee-house.
          8 to 9, Drury-lane playhouse.
          9 to 10, Lincoln's Inn Fields.
         10 to 12, Drawing-room. _A great groan._

At all which places nothing happened worth remark.

At which Adams said, with some vehemence, "Sir, this is below the life
of an animal, hardly above vegetation: and I am surprized what could
lead a man of your sense into it." What leads us into more follies than
you imagine, doctor, answered the gentleman--vanity; for as contemptible
a creature as I was, and I assure you, yourself cannot have more
contempt for such a wretch than I now have, I then admired myself, and
should have despised a person of your present appearance (you will
pardon me), with all your learning and those excellent qualities which I
have remarked in you. Adams bowed, and begged him to proceed. After I
had continued two years in this course of life, said the gentleman, an
accident happened which obliged me to change the scene. As I was one day
at St James's coffee-house, making very free with the character of a
young lady of quality, an officer of the guards, who was present,
thought proper to give me the lye. I answered I might possibly be
mistaken, but I intended to tell no more than the truth. To which he
made no reply but by a scornful sneer. After this I observed a strange
coldness in all my acquaintance; none of them spoke to me first, and
very few returned me even the civility of a bow. The company I used to
dine with left me out, and within a week I found myself in as much
solitude at St James's as if I had been in a desart. An honest elderly
man, with a great hat and long sword, at last told me he had a
compassion for my youth, and therefore advised me to show the world I
was not such a rascal as they thought me to be. I did not at first
understand him; but he explained himself, and ended with telling me, if
I would write a challenge to the captain, he would, out of pure charity,
go to him with it. "A very charitable person, truly!" cried Adams. I
desired till the next day, continued the gentleman, to consider on it,
and, retiring to my lodgings, I weighed the consequences on both sides
as fairly as I could. On the one, I saw the risk of this alternative,
either losing my own life, or having on my hands the blood of a man with
whom I was not in the least angry. I soon determined that the good which
appeared on the other was not worth this hazard. I therefore resolved to
quit the scene, and presently retired to the Temple, where I took
chambers. Here I soon got a fresh set of acquaintance, who knew nothing
of what had happened to me. Indeed, they were not greatly to my
approbation; for the beaus of the Temple are only the shadows of the
others. They are the affectation of affectation. The vanity of these is
still more ridiculous, if possible, than of the others. Here I met with
smart fellows who drank with lords they did not know, and intrigued with
women they never saw. Covent Garden was now the farthest stretch of my
ambition; where I shone forth in the balconies at the playhouses,
visited whores, made love to orange-wenches, and damned plays. This
career was soon put a stop to by my surgeon, who convinced me of the
necessity of confining myself to my room for a month. At the end of
which, having had leisure to reflect, I resolved to quit all farther
conversation with beaus and smarts of every kind, and to avoid, if
possible, any occasion of returning to this place of confinement. "I
think," said Adams, "the advice of a month's retirement and reflection
was very proper; but I should rather have expected it from a divine than
a surgeon." The gentleman smiled at Adams's simplicity, and, without
explaining himself farther on such an odious subject, went on thus: I
was no sooner perfectly restored to health than I found my passion for
women, which I was afraid to satisfy as I had done, made me very uneasy;
I determined, therefore, to keep a mistress. Nor was I long before I
fixed my choice on a young woman, who had before been kept by two
gentlemen, and to whom I was recommended by a celebrated bawd. I took
her home to my chambers, and made her a settlement during cohabitation.
This would, perhaps, have been very ill paid: however, she did not
suffer me to be perplexed on that account; for, before quarter-day, I
found her at my chambers in too familiar conversation with a young
fellow who was drest like an officer, but was indeed a city apprentice.
Instead of excusing her inconstancy, she rapped out half-a-dozen oaths,
and, snapping her fingers at me, swore she scorned to confine herself to
the best man in England. Upon this we parted, and the same bawd
presently provided her another keeper. I was not so much concerned at
our separation as I found, within a day or two, I had reason to be for
our meeting; for I was obliged to pay a second visit to my surgeon. I
was now forced to do penance for some weeks, during which time I
contracted an acquaintance with a beautiful young girl, the daughter of
a gentleman who, after having been forty years in the army, and in all
the campaigns under the Duke of Marlborough, died a lieutenant on
half-pay, and had left a widow, with this only child, in very distrest
circumstances: they had only a small pension from the government, with
what little the daughter could add to it by her work, for she had great
excellence at her needle. This girl was, at my first acquaintance with
her, solicited in marriage by a young fellow in good circumstances. He
was apprentice to a linendraper, and had a little fortune, sufficient to
set up his trade. The mother was greatly pleased with this match, as
indeed she had sufficient reason. However, I soon prevented it. I
represented him in so low a light to his mistress, and made so good an
use of flattery, promises, and presents, that, not to dwell longer on
this subject than is necessary, I prevailed with the poor girl, and
conveyed her away from her mother! In a word, I debauched her.--(At
which words Adams started up, fetched three strides across the room, and
then replaced himself in his chair.) You are not more affected with this
part of my story than myself; I assure you it will never be sufficiently
repented of in my own opinion: but, if you already detest it, how much
more will your indignation be raised when you hear the fatal
consequences of this barbarous, this villanous action! If you please,
therefore, I will here desist.--"By no means," cries Adams; "go on, I
beseech you; and Heaven grant you may sincerely repent of this and many
other things you have related!"--I was now, continued the gentleman, as
happy as the possession of a fine young creature, who had a good
education, and was endued with many agreeable qualities, could make me.
We lived some months with vast fondness together, without any company or
conversation, more than we found in one another: but this could not
continue always; and, though I still preserved great affection for her,
I began more and more to want the relief of other company, and
consequently to leave her by degrees--at last whole days to herself. She
failed not to testify some uneasiness on these occasions, and complained
of the melancholy life she led; to remedy which, I introduced her into
the acquaintance of some other kept mistresses, with whom she used to
play at cards, and frequent plays and other diversions. She had not
lived long in this intimacy before I perceived a visible alteration in
her behaviour; all her modesty and innocence vanished by degrees, till
her mind became thoroughly tainted. She affected the company of rakes,
gave herself all manner of airs, was never easy but abroad, or when she
had a party at my chambers. She was rapacious of money, extravagant to
excess, loose in her conversation; and, if ever I demurred to any of her
demands, oaths, tears, and fits were the immediate consequences. As the
first raptures of fondness were long since over, this behaviour soon
estranged my affections from her; I began to reflect with pleasure that
she was not my wife, and to conceive an intention of parting with her;
of which, having given her a hint, she took care to prevent me the pains
of turning her out of doors, and accordingly departed herself, having
first broken open my escrutore, and taken with her all she could find,
to the amount of about £200. In the first heat of my resentment I
resolved to pursue her with all the vengeance of the law: but, as she
had the good luck to escape me during that ferment, my passion
afterwards cooled; and, having reflected that I had been the first
aggressor, and had done her an injury for which I could make her no
reparation, by robbing her of the innocence of her mind; and hearing at
the same time that the poor old woman her mother had broke her heart on
her daughter's elopement from her, I, concluding myself her murderer
("As you very well might," cries Adams, with a groan), was pleased that
God Almighty had taken this method of punishing me, and resolved quietly
to submit to the loss. Indeed, I could wish I had never heard more of
the poor creature, who became in the end an abandoned profligate; and,
after being some years a common prostitute, at last ended her miserable
life in Newgate.--Here the gentleman fetched a deep sigh, which Mr Adams
echoed very loudly; and both continued silent, looking on each other for
some minutes. At last the gentleman proceeded thus: I had been perfectly
constant to this girl during the whole time I kept her: but she had
scarce departed before I discovered more marks of her infidelity to me
than the loss of my money. In short, I was forced to make a third visit
to my surgeon, out of whose hands I did not get a hasty discharge.


I now forswore all future dealings with the sex, complained loudly that
the pleasure did not compensate the pain, and railed at the beautiful
creatures in as gross language as Juvenal himself formerly reviled them
in. I looked on all the town harlots with a detestation not easy to be
conceived, their persons appeared to me as painted palaces, inhabited by
Disease and Death: nor could their beauty make them more desirable
objects in my eyes than gilding could make me covet a pill, or golden
plates a coffin. But though I was no longer the absolute slave, I found
some reasons to own myself still the subject, of love. My hatred for
women decreased daily; and I am not positive but time might have
betrayed me again to some common harlot, had I not been secured by a
passion for the charming Sapphira, which, having once entered upon, made
a violent progress in my heart. Sapphira was wife to a man of fashion
and gallantry, and one who seemed, I own, every way worthy of her
affections; which, however, he had not the reputation of having. She was
indeed a coquette _achevée_. "Pray, sir," says Adams, "what is a
coquette? I have met with the word in French authors, but never could
assign any idea to it. I believe it is the same with _une sotte,_
Anglicè, a fool." Sir, answered the gentleman, perhaps you are not much
mistaken; but, as it is a particular kind of folly, I will endeavour to
describe it. Were all creatures to be ranked in the order of creation
according to their usefulness, I know few animals that would not take
place of a coquette; nor indeed hath this creature much pretence to
anything beyond instinct; for, though sometimes we might imagine it was
animated by the passion of vanity, yet far the greater part of its
actions fall beneath even that low motive; for instance, several absurd
gestures and tricks, infinitely more foolish than what can be observed
in the most ridiculous birds and beasts, and which would persuade the
beholder that the silly wretch was aiming at our contempt. Indeed its
characteristic is affectation, and this led and governed by whim only:
for as beauty, wisdom, wit, good-nature, politeness, and health are
sometimes affected by this creature, so are ugliness, folly, nonsense,
ill-nature, ill-breeding, and sickness likewise put on by it in their
turn. Its life is one constant lie; and the only rule by which you can
form any judgment of them is, that they are never what they seem. If it
was possible for a coquette to love (as it is not, for if ever it
attains this passion the coquette ceases instantly), it would wear the
face of indifference, if not of hatred, to the beloved object; you may
therefore be assured, when they endeavour to persuade you of their
liking, that they are indifferent to you at least. And indeed this was
the case of my Sapphira, who no sooner saw me in the number of her
admirers than she gave me what is commonly called encouragement: she
would often look at me, and, when she perceived me meet her eyes, would
instantly take them off, discovering at the same time as much surprize
and emotion as possible. These arts failed not of the success she
intended; and, as I grew more particular to her than the rest of her
admirers, she advanced, in proportion, more directly to me than to the
others. She affected the low voice, whisper, lisp, sigh, start, laugh,
and many other indications of passion which daily deceive thousands.
When I played at whist with her, she would look earnestly at me, and at
the same time lose deal or revoke; then burst into a ridiculous laugh
and cry, "La! I can't imagine what I was thinking of." To detain you no
longer, after I had gone through a sufficient course of gallantry, as I
thought, and was thoroughly convinced I had raised a violent passion in
my mistress, I sought an opportunity of coming to an eclaircissement
with her. She avoided this as much as possible; however, great assiduity
at length presented me one. I will not describe all the particulars of
this interview; let it suffice that, when she could no longer pretend
not to see my drift, she first affected a violent surprize, and
immediately after as violent a passion: she wondered what I had seen in
her conduct which could induce me to affront her in this manner; and,
breaking from me the first moment she could, told me I had no other way
to escape the consequence of her resentment than by never seeing, or at
least speaking to her more. I was not contented with this answer; I
still pursued her, but to no purpose; and was at length convinced that
her husband had the sole possession of her person, and that neither he
nor any other had made any impression on her heart. I was taken off from
following this _ignis fatuus_ by some advances which were made me by the
wife of a citizen, who, though neither very young nor handsome, was yet
too agreeable to be rejected by my amorous constitution. I accordingly
soon satisfied her that she had not cast away her hints on a barren or
cold soil: on the contrary, they instantly produced her an eager and
desiring lover. Nor did she give me any reason to complain; she met the
warmth she had raised with equal ardour. I had no longer a coquette to
deal with, but one who was wiser than to prostitute the noble passion of
love to the ridiculous lust of vanity. We presently understood one
another; and, as the pleasures we sought lay in a mutual gratification,
we soon found and enjoyed them. I thought myself at first greatly happy
in the possession of this new mistress, whose fondness would have
quickly surfeited a more sickly appetite; but it had a different effect
on mine: she carried my passion higher by it than youth or beauty had
been able. But my happiness could not long continue uninterrupted. The
apprehensions we lay under from the jealousy of her husband gave us
great uneasiness. "Poor wretch! I pity him," cried Adams. He did indeed
deserve it, said the gentleman; for he loved his wife with great
tenderness; and, I assure you, it is a great satisfaction to me that I
was not the man who first seduced her affections from him. These
apprehensions appeared also too well grounded, for in the end he
discovered us, and procured witnesses of our caresses. He then
prosecuted me at law, and recovered £3000 damages, which much distressed
my fortune to pay; and, what was worse, his wife, being divorced, came
upon my hands. I led a very uneasy life with her; for, besides that my
passion was now much abated, her excessive jealousy was very
troublesome. At length death rid me of an inconvenience which the
consideration of my having been the author of her misfortunes would
never suffer me to take any other method of discarding.

I now bad adieu to love, and resolved to pursue other less dangerous and
expensive pleasures. I fell into the acquaintance of a set of jolly
companions, who slept all day and drank all night; fellows who might
rather be said to consume time than to live. Their best conversation was
nothing but noise: singing, hollowing, wrangling, drinking, toasting,
sp--wing, smoaking were the chief ingredients of our entertainment. And
yet, bad as these were, they were more tolerable than our graver scenes,
which were either excessive tedious narratives of dull common matters of
fact, or hot disputes about trifling matters, which commonly ended in a
wager. This way of life the first serious reflection put a period to;
and I became member of a club frequented by young men of great
abilities. The bottle was now only called in to the assistance of our
conversation, which rolled on the deepest points of philosophy. These
gentlemen were engaged in a search after truth, in the pursuit of which
they threw aside all the prejudices of education, and governed
themselves only by the infallible guide of human reason. This great
guide, after having shown them the falsehood of that very ancient but
simple tenet, that there is such a being as a Deity in the universe,
helped them to establish in his stead a certain rule of right, by
adhering to which they all arrived at the utmost purity of morals.
Reflection made me as much delighted with this society as it had taught
me to despise and detest the former. I began now to esteem myself a
being of a higher order than I had ever before conceived; and was the
more charmed with this rule of right, as I really found in my own nature
nothing repugnant to it. I held in utter contempt all persons who wanted
any other inducement to virtue besides her intrinsic beauty and
excellence; and had so high an opinion of my present companions, with
regard to their morality, that I would have trusted them with whatever
was nearest and dearest to me. Whilst I was engaged in this delightful
dream, two or three accidents happened successively, which at first much
surprized me;--for one of our greatest philosophers, or rule-of-right
men, withdrew himself from us, taking with him the wife of one of his
most intimate friends. Secondly, another of the same society left the
club without remembering to take leave of his bail. A third, having
borrowed a sum of money of me, for which I received no security, when I
asked him to repay it, absolutely denied the loan. These several
practices, so inconsistent with our golden rule, made me begin to
suspect its infallibility; but when I communicated my thoughts to one of
the club, he said, "There was nothing absolutely good or evil in itself;
that actions were denominated good or bad by the circumstances of the
agent. That possibly the man who ran away with his neighbour's wife
might be one of very good inclinations, but over-prevailed on by the
violence of an unruly passion; and, in other particulars, might be a
very worthy member of society; that if the beauty of any woman created
in him an uneasiness, he had a right from nature to relieve
himself;"--with many other things, which I then detested so much, that I
took leave of the society that very evening and never returned to it
again. Being now reduced to a state of solitude which I did not like, I
became a great frequenter of the playhouses, which indeed was always my
favourite diversion; and most evenings passed away two or three hours
behind the scenes, where I met with several poets, with whom I made
engagements at the taverns. Some of the players were likewise of our
parties. At these meetings we were generally entertained by the poets
with reading their performances, and by the players with repeating their
parts: upon which occasions, I observed the gentleman who furnished our
entertainment was commonly the best pleased of the company; who, though
they were pretty civil to him to his face, seldom failed to take the
first opportunity of his absence to ridicule him. Now I made some
remarks which probably are too obvious to be worth relating. "Sir," says
Adams, "your remarks if you please." First then, says he, I concluded
that the general observation, that wits are most inclined to vanity, is
not true. Men are equally vain of riches, strength, beauty, honours, &c.
But these appear of themselves to the eyes of the beholders, whereas the
poor wit is obliged to produce his performance to show you his
perfection; and on his readiness to do this that vulgar opinion I have
before mentioned is grounded; but doth not the person who expends vast
sums in the furniture of his house or the ornaments of his person, who
consumes much time and employs great pains in dressing himself, or who
thinks himself paid for self-denial, labour, or even villany, by a title
or a ribbon, sacrifice as much to vanity as the poor wit who is desirous
to read you his poem or his play? My second remark was, that vanity is
the worst of passions, and more apt to contaminate the mind than any
other: for, as selfishness is much more general than we please to allow
it, so it is natural to hate and envy those who stand between us and the
good we desire. Now, in lust and ambition these are few; and even in
avarice we find many who are no obstacles to our pursuits; but the vain
man seeks pre-eminence; and everything which is excellent or
praiseworthy in another renders him the mark of his antipathy. Adams now
began to fumble in his pockets, and soon cried out, "O la! I have it not
about me." Upon this, the gentleman asking him what he was searching
for, he said he searched after a sermon, which he thought his
masterpiece, against vanity. "Fie upon it, fie upon it!" cries he, "why
do I ever leave that sermon out of my pocket? I wish it was within five
miles; I would willingly fetch it, to read it you." The gentleman
answered that there was no need, for he was cured of the passion. "And
for that very reason," quoth Adams, "I would read it, for I am confident
you would admire it: indeed, I have never been a greater enemy to any
passion than that silly one of vanity." The gentleman smiled, and
proceeded--From this society I easily passed to that of the gamesters,
where nothing remarkable happened but the finishing my fortune, which
those gentlemen soon helped me to the end of. This opened scenes of life
hitherto unknown; poverty and distress, with their horrid train of duns,
attorneys, bailiffs, haunted me day and night. My clothes grew shabby,
my credit bad, my friends and acquaintance of all kinds cold. In this
situation the strangest thought imaginable came into my head; and what
was this but to write a play? for I had sufficient leisure: fear of
bailiffs confined me every day to my room: and, having always had a
little inclination and something of a genius that way, I set myself to
work, and within a few months produced a piece of five acts, which was
accepted of at the theatre. I remembered to have formerly taken tickets
of other poets for their benefits, long before the appearance of their
performances; and, resolving to follow a precedent which was so well
suited to my present circumstances, I immediately provided myself with a
large number of little papers. Happy indeed would be the state of
poetry, would these tickets pass current at the bakehouse, the
ale-house, and the chandler's shop: but alas! far otherwise; no taylor
will take them in payment for buckram, canvas, stay-tape; nor no bailiff
for civility money. They are, indeed, no more than a passport to beg
with; a certificate that the owner wants five shillings, which induces
well-disposed Christians to charity. I now experienced what is worse
than poverty, or rather what is the worst consequence of poverty--I mean
attendance and dependance on the great. Many a morning have I waited
hours in the cold parlours of men of quality; where, after seeing the
lowest rascals in lace and embroidery, the pimps and buffoons in
fashion, admitted, I have been sometimes told, on sending in my name,
that my lord could not possibly see me this morning; a sufficient
assurance that I should never more get entrance into that house.
Sometimes I have been at last admitted; and the great man hath thought
proper to excuse himself, by telling me he was tied up. "Tied up," says
Adams, "pray what's that?" Sir, says the gentleman, the profit which
booksellers allowed authors for the best works was so very small, that
certain men of birth and fortune some years ago, who were the patrons of
wit and learning, thought fit to encourage them farther by entering into
voluntary subscriptions for their encouragement. Thus Prior, Rowe, Pope,
and some other men of genius, received large sums for their labours from
the public. This seemed so easy a method of getting money, that many of
the lowest scribblers of the times ventured to publish their works in
the same way; and many had the assurance to take in subscriptions for
what was not writ, nor ever intended. Subscriptions in this manner
growing infinite, and a kind of tax on the publick, some persons,
finding it not so easy a task to discern good from bad authors, or to
know what genius was worthy encouragement and what was not, to prevent
the expense of subscribing to so many, invented a method to excuse
themselves from all subscriptions whatever; and this was to receive a
small sum of money in consideration of giving a large one if ever they
subscribed; which many have done, and many more have pretended to have
done, in order to silence all solicitation. The same method was likewise
taken with playhouse tickets, which were no less a public grievance; and
this is what they call being tied up from subscribing. "I can't say but
the term is apt enough, and somewhat typical," said Adams; "for a man of
large fortune, who ties himself up, as you call it, from the
encouragement of men of merit, ought to be tied up in reality." Well,
sir, says the gentleman, to return to my story. Sometimes I have
received a guinea from a man of quality, given with as ill a grace as
alms are generally to the meanest beggar; and purchased too with as much
time spent in attendance as, if it had been spent in honest industry,
might have brought me more profit with infinitely more satisfaction.
After about two months spent in this disagreeable way, with the utmost
mortification, when I was pluming my hopes on the prospect of a
plentiful harvest from my play, upon applying to the prompter to know
when it came into rehearsal, he informed me he had received orders from
the managers to return me the play again, for that they could not
possibly act it that season; but, if I would take it and revise it
against the next, they would be glad to see it again. I snatched it from
him with great indignation, and retired to my room, where I threw myself
on the bed in a fit of despair. "You should rather have thrown yourself
on your knees," says Adams, "for despair is sinful." As soon, continued
the gentleman, as I had indulged the first tumult of my passion, I began
to consider coolly what course I should take, in a situation without
friends, money, credit, or reputation of any kind. After revolving many
things in my mind, I could see no other possibility of furnishing myself
with the miserable necessaries of life than to retire to a garret near
the Temple, and commence hackney-writer to the lawyers, for which I was
well qualified, being an excellent penman. This purpose I resolved on,
and immediately put it in execution. I had an acquaintance with an
attorney who had formerly transacted affairs for me, and to him I
applied; but, instead of furnishing me with any business, he laughed at
my undertaking, and told me, "He was afraid I should turn his deeds into
plays, and he should expect to see them on the stage." Not to tire you
with instances of this kind from others, I found that Plato himself did
not hold poets in greater abhorrence than these men of business do.
Whenever I durst venture to a coffeehouse, which was on Sundays only, a
whisper ran round the room, which was constantly attended with a
sneer--That's poet Wilson; for I know not whether you have observed it,
but there is a malignity in the nature of man, which, when not weeded
out, or at least covered by a good education and politeness, delights in
making another uneasy or dissatisfied with himself. This abundantly
appears in all assemblies, except those which are filled by people of
fashion, and especially among the younger people of both sexes whose
birth and fortunes place them just without the polite circles; I mean
the lower class of the gentry, and the higher of the mercantile world,
who are, in reality, the worst-bred part of mankind. Well, sir, whilst I
continued in this miserable state, with scarce sufficient business to
keep me from starving, the reputation of a poet being my bane, I
accidentally became acquainted with a bookseller, who told me, "It was a
pity a man of my learning and genius should be obliged to such a method
of getting his livelihood; that he had a compassion for me, and, if I
would engage with him, he would undertake to provide handsomely for me."
A man in my circumstances, as he very well knew, had no choice. I
accordingly accepted his proposal with his conditions, which were none
of the most favourable, and fell to translating with all my might. I had
no longer reason to lament the want of business; for he furnished me
with so much, that in half a year I almost writ myself blind. I likewise
contracted a distemper by my sedentary life, in which no part of my body
was exercised but my right arm, which rendered me incapable of writing
for a long time. This unluckily happening to delay the publication of a
work, and my last performance not having sold well, the bookseller
declined any further engagement, and aspersed me to his brethren as a
careless idle fellow. I had, however, by having half worked and half
starved myself to death during the time I was in his service, saved a
few guineas, with which I bought a lottery-ticket, resolving to throw
myself into Fortune's lap, and try if she would make me amends for the
injuries she had done me at the gaming-table. This purchase, being made,
left me almost pennyless; when, as if I had not been sufficiently
miserable, a bailiff in woman's clothes got admittance to my chamber,
whither he was directed by the bookseller. He arrested me at my taylor's
suit for thirty-five pounds; a sum for which I could not procure bail;
and was therefore conveyed to his house, where I was locked up in an
upper chamber. I had now neither health (for I was scarce recovered from
my indisposition), liberty, money, or friends; and had abandoned all
hopes, and even the desire, of life. "But this could not last long,"
said Adams; "for doubtless the taylor released you the moment he was
truly acquainted with your affairs, and knew that your circumstances
would not permit you to pay him." "Oh, sir," answered the gentleman, "he
knew that before he arrested me; nay, he knew that nothing but
incapacity could prevent me paying my debts; for I had been his customer
many years, had spent vast sums of money with him, and had always paid
most punctually in my prosperous days; but when I reminded him of this,
with assurances that, if he would not molest my endeavours, I would pay
him all the money I could by my utmost labour and industry procure,
reserving only what was sufficient to preserve me alive, he answered,
his patience was worn out; that I had put him off from time to time;
that he wanted the money; that he had put it into a lawyer's hands; and
if I did not pay him immediately, or find security, I must die in gaol
and expect no mercy." "He may expect mercy," cries Adams, starting from
his chair, "where he will find none! How can such a wretch repeat the
Lord's Prayer; where the word, which is translated, I know not for what
reason, trespasses, is in the original, debts? And as surely as we do
not forgive others their debts, when they are unable to pay them, so
surely shall we ourselves be unforgiven when we are in no condition of
paying." He ceased, and the gentleman proceeded. While I was in this
deplorable situation, a former acquaintance, to whom I had communicated
my lottery-ticket, found me out, and, making me a visit, with great
delight in his countenance, shook me heartily by the hand, and wished me
joy of my good fortune: for, says he, your ticket is come up a prize of
£3000. Adams snapped his fingers at these words in an ecstasy of joy;
which, however, did not continue long; for the gentleman thus
proceeded:--Alas! sir, this was only a trick of Fortune to sink me the
deeper; for I had disposed of this lottery-ticket two days before to a
relation, who refused lending me a shilling without it, in order to
procure myself bread. As soon as my friend was acquainted with my
unfortunate sale he began to revile me and remind me of all the
ill-conduct and miscarriages of my life. He said I was one whom Fortune
could not save if she would; that I was now ruined without any hopes of
retrieval, nor must expect any pity from my friends; that it would be
extreme weakness to compassionate the misfortunes of a man who ran
headlong to his own destruction. He then painted to me, in as lively
colours as he was able, the happiness I should have now enjoyed, had I
not foolishly disposed of my ticket. I urged the plea of necessity; but
he made no answer to that, and began again to revile me, till I could
bear it no longer, and desired him to finish his visit. I soon exchanged
the bailiff's house for a prison; where, as I had not money sufficient
to procure me a separate apartment, I was crouded in with a great number
of miserable wretches, in common with whom I was destitute of every
convenience of life, even that which all the brutes enjoy, wholesome
air. In these dreadful circumstances I applied by letter to several of
my old acquaintance, and such to whom I had formerly lent money without
any great prospect of its being returned, for their assistance; but in
vain. An excuse, instead of a denial, was the gentlest answer I
received. Whilst I languished in a condition too horrible to be
described, and which, in a land of humanity, and, what is much more,
Christianity, seems a strange punishment for a little inadvertency and
indiscretion; whilst I was in this condition, a fellow came into the
prison, and, enquiring me out, delivered me the following letter:--

    "SIR,--My father, to whom you sold your ticket in the last
    lottery, died the same day in which it came up a prize, as you
    have possibly heard, and left me sole heiress of all his
    fortune. I am so much touched with your present circumstances,
    and the uneasiness you must feel at having been driven to
    dispose of what might have made you happy, that I must desire
    your acceptance of the enclosed, and am your humble servant,

    "HARRIET HEARTY."

And what do you think was enclosed? "I don't know," cried Adams; "not
less than a guinea, I hope." Sir, it was a bank-note for £200.--"£200?"
says Adams, in a rapture. No less, I assure you, answered the gentleman;
a sum I was not half so delighted with as with the dear name of the
generous girl that sent it me; and who was not only the best but the
handsomest creature in the universe, and for whom I had long had a
passion which I never durst disclose to her. I kissed her name a
thousand times, my eyes overflowing with tenderness and gratitude; I
repeated--But not to detain you with these raptures, I immediately
acquired my liberty; and, having paid all my debts, departed, with
upwards of fifty pounds in my pocket, to thank my kind deliverer. She
happened to be then out of town, a circumstance which, upon reflection,
pleased me; for by that means I had an opportunity to appear before her
in a more decent dress. At her return to town, within a day or two, I
threw myself at her feet with the most ardent acknowledgments, which she
rejected with an unfeigned greatness of mind, and told me I could not
oblige her more than by never mentioning, or if possible thinking on, a
circumstance which must bring to my mind an accident that might be
grievous to me to think on. She proceeded thus: "What I have done is in
my own eyes a trifle, and perhaps infinitely less than would have become
me to do. And if you think of engaging in any business where a larger
sum may be serviceable to you, I shall not be over-rigid either as to
the security or interest." I endeavoured to express all the gratitude in
my power to this profusion of goodness, though perhaps it was my enemy,
and began to afflict my mind with more agonies than all the miseries I
had underwent; it affected me with severer reflections than poverty,
distress, and prisons united had been able to make me feel; for, sir,
these acts and professions of kindness, which were sufficient to have
raised in a good heart the most violent passion of friendship to one of
the same, or to age and ugliness in a different sex, came to me from a
woman, a young and beautiful woman; one whose perfections I had long
known, and for whom I had long conceived a violent passion, though with
a despair which made me endeavour rather to curb and conceal, than to
nourish or acquaint her with it. In short, they came upon me united with
beauty, softness, and tenderness: such bewitching smiles!--O Mr Adams,
in that moment I lost myself, and, forgetting our different situations,
nor considering what return I was making to her goodness by desiring
her, who had given me so much, to bestow her all, I laid gently hold on
her hand, and, conveying it to my lips, I prest it with inconceivable
ardour; then, lifting up my swimming eyes, I saw her face and neck
overspread with one blush; she offered to withdraw her hand, yet not so
as to deliver it from mine, though I held it with the gentlest force. We
both stood trembling; her eyes cast on the ground, and mine stedfastly
fixed on her. Good G--d, what was then the condition of my soul! burning
with love, desire, admiration, gratitude, and every tender passion, all
bent on one charming object. Passion at last got the better of both
reason and respect, and, softly letting go her hand, I offered madly to
clasp her in my arms; when, a little recovering herself, she started
from me, asking me, with some show of anger, "If she had any reason to
expect this treatment from me." I then fell prostrate before her, and
told her, if I had offended, my life was absolutely in her power, which
I would in any manner lose for her sake. Nay, madam, said I, you shall
not be so ready to punish me as I to suffer. I own my guilt. I detest
the reflection that I would have sacrificed your happiness to mine.
Believe me, I sincerely repent my ingratitude; yet, believe me too, it
was my passion, my unbounded passion for you, which hurried me so far: I
have loved you long and tenderly, and the goodness you have shown me
hath innocently weighed down a wretch undone before. Acquit me of all
mean, mercenary views; and, before I take my leave of you for ever,
which I am resolved instantly to do, believe me that Fortune could have
raised me to no height to which I could not have gladly lifted you. O,
curst be Fortune!--"Do not," says she, interrupting me with the sweetest
voice, "do not curse Fortune, since she hath made me happy; and, if she
hath put your happiness in my power, I have told you you shall ask
nothing in reason which I will refuse." Madam, said I, you mistake me if
you imagine, as you seem, my happiness is in the power of Fortune now.
You have obliged me too much already; if I have any wish, it is for some
blest accident, by which I may contribute with my life to the least
augmentation of your felicity. As for myself, the only happiness I can
ever have will be hearing of yours; and if Fortune will make that
complete, I will forgive her all her wrongs to me. "You may, indeed,"
answered she, smiling, "for your own happiness must be included in mine.
I have long known your worth; nay, I must confess," said she, blushing,
"I have long discovered that passion for me you profess, notwithstanding
those endeavours, which I am convinced were unaffected, to conceal it;
and if all I can give with reason will not suffice, take reason away;
and now I believe you cannot ask me what I will deny."--She uttered
these words with a sweetness not to be imagined. I immediately started;
my blood, which lay freezing at my heart, rushed tumultuously through
every vein. I stood for a moment silent; then, flying to her, I caught
her in my arms, no longer resisting, and softly told her she must give
me then herself. O, sir! can I describe her look? She remained silent,
and almost motionless, several minutes. At last, recovering herself a
little, she insisted on my leaving her, and in such a manner that I
instantly obeyed: you may imagine, however, I soon saw her again.--But I
ask pardon: I fear I have detained you too long in relating the
particulars of the former interview. "So far otherwise," said Adams,
licking his lips, "that I could willingly hear it over again." Well,
sir, continued the gentleman, to be as concise as possible, within a
week she consented to make me the happiest of mankind. We were married
shortly after; and when I came to examine the circumstances of my wife's
fortune (which, I do assure you, I was not presently at leisure enough
to do), I found it amounted to about six thousand pounds, most part of
which lay in effects; for her father had been a wine-merchant, and she
seemed willing, if I liked it, that I should carry on the same trade. I
readily, and too inconsiderately, undertook it; for, not having been
bred up to the secrets of the business, and endeavouring to deal with
the utmost honesty and uprightness, I soon found our fortune in a
declining way, and my trade decreasing by little and little; for my
wines, which I never adulterated after their importation, and were sold
as neat as they came over, were universally decried by the vintners, to
whom I could not allow them quite as cheap as those who gained double
the profit by a less price. I soon began to despair of improving our
fortune by these means; nor was I at all easy at the visits and
familiarity of many who had been my acquaintance in my prosperity, but
had denied and shunned me in my adversity, and now very forwardly
renewed their acquaintance with me. In short, I had sufficiently seen
that the pleasures of the world are chiefly folly, and the business of
it mostly knavery, and both nothing better than vanity; the men of
pleasure tearing one another to pieces from the emulation of spending
money, and the men of business from envy in getting it. My happiness
consisted entirely in my wife, whom I loved with an inexpressible
fondness, which was perfectly returned; and my prospects were no other
than to provide for our growing family; for she was now big of her
second child: I therefore took an opportunity to ask her opinion of
entering into a retired life, which, after hearing my reasons and
perceiving my affection for it, she readily embraced. We soon put our
small fortune, now reduced under three thousand pounds, into money, with
part of which we purchased this little place, whither we retired soon
after her delivery, from a world full of bustle, noise, hatred, envy,
and ingratitude, to ease, quiet, and love. We have here lived almost
twenty years, with little other conversation than our own, most of the
neighbourhood taking us for very strange people; the squire of the
parish representing me as a madman, and the parson as a presbyterian,
because I will not hunt with the one nor drink with the other. "Sir,"
says Adams, "Fortune hath, I think, paid you all her debts in this sweet
retirement." Sir, replied the gentleman, I am thankful to the great
Author of all things for the blessings I here enjoy. I have the best of
wives, and three pretty children, for whom I have the true tenderness of
a parent. But no blessings are pure in this world: within three years of
my arrival here I lost my eldest son. (Here he sighed bitterly.) "Sir,"
says Adams, "we must submit to Providence, and consider death as common
to all." We must submit, indeed, answered the gentleman; and if he had
died I could have borne the loss with patience; but alas! sir, he was
stolen away from my door by some wicked travelling people whom they call
gipsies; nor could I ever, with the most diligent search, recover him.
Poor child! he had the sweetest look--the exact picture of his mother;
at which some tears unwittingly dropt from his eyes, as did likewise
from those of Adams, who always sympathized with his friends on those
occasions. Thus, sir, said the gentleman, I have finished my story, in
which if I have been too particular, I ask your pardon; and now, if you
please, I will fetch you another bottle: which proposal the parson
thankfully accepted.



CHAPTER IV.

_A description of Mr Wilson's way of living. The tragical adventure of
the dog, and other grave matters._


The gentleman returned with the bottle; and Adams and he sat some time
silent, when the former started up, and cried, "No, that won't do." The
gentleman inquired into his meaning; he answered, "He had been
considering that it was possible the late famous king Theodore might
have been that very son whom he had lost;" but added, "that his age
could not answer that imagination. However," says he, "G-- disposes all
things for the best; and very probably he may be some great man, or
duke, and may, one day or other, revisit you in that capacity." The
gentleman answered, he should know him amongst ten thousand, for he had
a mark on his left breast of a strawberry, which his mother had given
him by longing for that fruit.

That beautiful young lady the Morning now rose from her bed, and with a
countenance blooming with fresh youth and sprightliness, like Miss
----[A], with soft dews hanging on her pouting lips, began to take her
early walk over the eastern hills; and presently after, that gallant
person the Sun stole softly from his wife's chamber to pay his addresses
to her; when the gentleman asked his guest if he would walk forth and
survey his little garden, which he readily agreed to, and Joseph at the
same time awaking from a sleep in which he had been two hours buried,
went with them. No parterres, no fountains, no statues, embellished this
little garden. Its only ornament was a short walk, shaded on each side
by a filbert-hedge, with a small alcove at one end, whither in hot
weather the gentleman and his wife used to retire and divert themselves
with their children, who played in the walk before them. But, though
vanity had no votary in this little spot, here was variety of fruit and
everything useful for the kitchen, which was abundantly sufficient to
catch the admiration of Adams, who told the gentleman he had certainly a
good gardener. Sir, answered he, that gardener is now before you:
whatever you see here is the work solely of my own hands. Whilst I am
providing necessaries for my table, I likewise procure myself an
appetite for them. In fair seasons I seldom pass less than six hours of
the twenty-four in this place, where I am not idle; and by these means I
have been able to preserve my health ever since my arrival here, without
assistance from physic. Hither I generally repair at the dawn, and
exercise myself whilst my wife dresses her children and prepares our
breakfast; after which we are seldom asunder during the residue of the
day, for, when the weather will not permit them to accompany me here, I
am usually within with them; for I am neither ashamed of conversing with
my wife nor of playing with my children: to say the truth, I do not
perceive that inferiority of understanding which the levity of rakes,
the dulness of men of business, or the austerity of the learned, would
persuade us of in women. As for my woman, I declare I have found none of
my own sex capable of making juster observations on life, or of
delivering them more agreeably; nor do I believe any one possessed of a
faithfuller or braver friend. And sure as this friendship is sweetened
with more delicacy and tenderness, so is it confirmed by dearer pledges
than can attend the closest male alliance; for what union can be so fast
as our common interest in the fruits of our embraces? Perhaps, sir, you
are not yourself a father; if you are not, be assured you cannot
conceive the delight I have in my little ones. Would you not despise me
if you saw me stretched on the ground, and my children playing round me?
"I should reverence the sight," quoth Adams; "I myself am now the father
of six, and have been of eleven, and I can say I never scourged a child
of my own, unless as his schoolmaster, and then have felt every stroke
on my own posteriors. And as to what you say concerning women, I have
often lamented my own wife did not understand Greek."--The gentleman
smiled, and answered, he would not be apprehended to insinuate that his
own had an understanding above the care of her family; on the contrary,
says he, my Harriet, I assure you, is a notable housewife, and few
gentlemen's housekeepers understand cookery or confectionery better; but
these are arts which she hath no great occasion for now: however, the
wine you commended so much last night at supper was of her own making,
as is indeed all the liquor in my house, except my beer, which falls to
my province. "And I assure you it is as excellent," quoth Adams, "as
ever I tasted." We formerly kept a maid-servant, but since my girls have
been growing up she is unwilling to indulge them in idleness; for as the
fortunes I shall give them will be very small, we intend not to breed
them above the rank they are likely to fill hereafter, nor to teach them
to despise or ruin a plain husband. Indeed, I could wish a man of my own
temper, and a retired life, might fall to their lot; for I have
experienced that calm serene happiness, which is seated in content, is
inconsistent with the hurry and bustle of the world. He was proceeding
thus when the little things, being just risen, ran eagerly towards him
and asked him blessing. They were shy to the strangers, but the eldest
acquainted her father, that her mother and the young gentlewoman were
up, and that breakfast was ready. They all went in, where the gentleman
was surprized at the beauty of Fanny, who had now recovered herself from
her fatigue, and was entirely clean drest; for the rogues who had taken
away her purse had left her her bundle. But if he was so much amazed at
the beauty of this young creature, his guests were no less charmed at
the tenderness which appeared in the behaviour of the husband and wife
to each other, and to their children, and at the dutiful and
affectionate behaviour of these to their parents. These instances
pleased the well-disposed mind of Adams equally with the readiness which
they exprest to oblige their guests, and their forwardness to offer them
the best of everything in their house; and what delighted him still more
was an instance or two of their charity; for whilst they were at
breakfast the good woman was called for to assist her sick neighbour,
which she did with some cordials made for the public use, and the good
man went into his garden at the same time to supply another with
something which he wanted thence, for they had nothing which those who
wanted it were not welcome to. These good people were in the utmost
cheerfulness, when they heard the report of a gun, and immediately
afterwards a little dog, the favourite of the eldest daughter, came
limping in all bloody and laid himself at his mistress's feet: the poor
girl, who was about eleven years old, burst into tears at the sight; and
presently one of the neighbours came in and informed them that the young
squire, the son of the lord of the manor, had shot him as he past by,
swearing at the same time he would prosecute the master of him for
keeping a spaniel, for that he had given notice he would not suffer one
in the parish. The dog, whom his mistress had taken into her lap, died
in a few minutes, licking her hand. She exprest great agony at his loss,
and the other children began to cry for their sister's misfortune; nor
could Fanny herself refrain. Whilst the father and mother attempted to
comfort her, Adams grasped his crabstick and would have sallied out
after the squire had not Joseph withheld him. He could not however
bridle his tongue--he pronounced the word rascal with great emphasis;
said he deserved to be hanged more than a highwayman, and wished he had
the scourging him. The mother took her child, lamenting and carrying the
dead favourite in her arms, out of the room, when the gentleman said
this was the second time this squire had endeavoured to kill the little
wretch, and had wounded him smartly once before; adding, he could have
no motive but ill-nature, for the little thing, which was not near as
big as one's fist, had never been twenty yards from the house in the six
years his daughter had had it. He said he had done nothing to deserve
this usage, but his father had too great a fortune to contend with: that
he was as absolute as any tyrant in the universe, and had killed all the
dogs and taken away all the guns in the neighbourhood; and not only
that, but he trampled down hedges and rode over corn and gardens, with
no more regard than if they were the highway. "I wish I could catch him
in my garden," said Adams, "though I would rather forgive him riding
through my house than such an ill-natured act as this."

The cheerfulness of their conversation being interrupted by this
accident, in which the guests could be of no service to their kind
entertainer; and as the mother was taken up in administering consolation
to the poor girl, whose disposition was too good hastily to forget the
sudden loss of her little favourite, which had been fondling with her
a few minutes before; and as Joseph and Fanny were impatient to get home
and begin those previous ceremonies to their happiness which Adams had
insisted on, they now offered to take their leave. The gentleman
importuned them much to stay dinner; but when he found their eagerness
to depart he summoned his wife; and accordingly, having performed all
the usual ceremonies of bows and curtsies more pleasant to be seen than
to be related, they took their leave, the gentleman and his wife
heartily wishing them a good journey, and they as heartily thanking them
for their kind entertainment. They then departed, Adams declaring that
this was the manner in which the people had lived in the golden age.

CHAPTER V.

_A disputation on schools held on the road between Mr Abraham Adams and
Joseph; and a discovery not unwelcome to them both._


Our travellers, having well refreshed themselves at the gentleman's
house, Joseph and Fanny with sleep, and Mr Abraham Adams with ale and
tobacco, renewed their journey with great alacrity; and pursuing the
road into which they were directed, travelled many miles before they
met with any adventure worth relating. In this interval we shall
present our readers with a very curious discourse, as we apprehend it,
concerning public schools, which passed between Mr Joseph Andrews and
Mr Abraham Adams.

They had not gone far before Adams, calling to Joseph, asked him, "If
he had attended to the gentleman's story?" He answered, "To all the
former part."--"And don't you think," says he, "he was a very unhappy
man in his youth?"--"A very unhappy man, indeed," answered the other.
"Joseph," cries Adams, screwing up his mouth, "I have found it; I have
discovered the cause of all the misfortunes which befel him: a public
school, Joseph, was the cause of all the calamities which he
afterwards suffered. Public schools are the nurseries of all vice and
immorality. All the wicked fellows whom I remember at the university
were bred at them.--Ah, Lord! I can remember as well as if it was but
yesterday, a knot of them; they called them King's scholars, I forget
why--very wicked fellows! Joseph, you may thank the Lord you were not
bred at a public school; you would never have preserved your virtue as
you have. The first care I always take is of a boy's morals; I had
rather he should be a blockhead than an atheist or a presbyterian.
What is all the learning in the world compared to his immortal soul?
What shall a man take in exchange for his soul? But the masters of
great schools trouble themselves about no such thing. I have known a
lad of eighteen at the university, who hath not been able to say his
catechism; but for my own part, I always scourged a lad sooner for
missing that than any other lesson. Believe me, child, all that
gentleman's misfortunes arose from his being educated at a public
school."

"It doth not become me," answered Joseph, "to dispute anything, sir,
with you, especially a matter of this kind; for to be sure you must be
allowed by all the world to be the best teacher of a school in all our
county." "Yes, that," says Adams, "I believe, is granted me; that I may
without much vanity pretend to--nay, I believe I may go to the next
county too--but _gloriari non est meum_."--"However, sir, as you are
pleased to bid me speak," says Joseph, "you know my late master, Sir
Thomas Booby, was bred at a public school, and he was the finest
gentleman in all the neighbourhood. And I have often heard him say, if
he had a hundred boys he would breed them all at the same place. It was
his opinion, and I have often heard him deliver it, that a boy taken
from a public school and carried into the world, will learn more in one
year there than one of a private education will in five. He used to say
the school itself initiated him a great way (I remember that was his
very expression), for great schools are little societies, where a boy
of any observation may see in epitome what he will afterwards find in
the world at large."--"_Hinc illae lachrymae_: for that very reason,"
quoth Adams, "I prefer a private school, where boys may be kept in
innocence and ignorance; for, according to that fine passage in the
play of Cato, the only English tragedy I ever read--

    "'If knowledge of the world must make men villains
    May Juba ever live in ignorance!'

"Who would not rather preserve the purity of his child than wish him to
attain the whole circle of arts and sciences? which, by the bye, he may
learn in the classes of a private school; for I would not be vain, but I
esteem myself to be second to none, _nulli secundum_, in teaching these
things; so that a lad may have as much learning in a private as in a
public education."--"And, with submission," answered Joseph, "he may get
as much vice: witness several country gentlemen, who were educated
within five miles of their own houses, and are as wicked as if they had
known the world from their infancy. I remember when I was in the stable,
if a young horse was vicious in his nature, no correction would make him
otherwise: I take it to be equally the same among men: if a boy be of a
mischievous wicked inclination, no school, though ever so private, will
ever make him good: on the contrary, if he be of a righteous temper, you
may trust him to London, or wherever else you please--he will be in no
danger of being corrupted. Besides, I have often heard my master say
that the discipline practised in public schools was much better than
that in private."--"You talk like a jackanapes," says Adams, "and so did
your master. Discipline indeed! Because one man scourges twenty or
thirty boys more in a morning than another, is he therefore a better
disciplinarian? I do presume to confer in this point with all who have
taught from Chiron's time to this day; and, if I was master of six boys
only, I would preserve as good discipline amongst them as the master of
the greatest school in the world. I say nothing, young man; remember I
say nothing; but if Sir Thomas himself had been educated nearer home,
and under the tuition of somebody--remember I name nobody--it might have
been better for him:--but his father must institute him in the knowledge
of the world. _Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit_." Joseph, seeing him
run on in this manner, asked pardon many times, assuring him he had no
intention to offend. "I believe you had not, child," said he, "and I am
not angry with you; but for maintaining good discipline in a school; for
this."--And then he ran on as before, named all the masters who are
recorded in old books, and preferred himself to them all. Indeed, if
this good man had an enthusiasm, or what the vulgar call a blind side,
it was this: he thought a schoolmaster the greatest character in the
world, and himself the greatest of all schoolmasters: neither of which
points he would have given up to Alexander the Great at the head of
his army.

Adams continued his subject till they came to one of the beautifullest
spots of ground in the universe. It was a kind of natural amphitheatre,
formed by the winding of a small rivulet, which was planted with thick
woods, and the trees rose gradually above each other by the natural
ascent of the ground they stood on; which ascent as they hid with their
boughs, they seemed to have been disposed by the design of the most
skilful planter. The soil was spread with a verdure which no paint could
imitate; and the whole place might have raised romantic ideas in elder
minds than those of Joseph and Fanny, without the assistance of love.

Here they arrived about noon, and Joseph proposed to Adams that they
should rest awhile in this delightful place, and refresh themselves with
some provisions which the good-nature of Mrs Wilson had provided them
with. Adams made no objection to the proposal; so down they sat, and,
pulling out a cold fowl and a bottle of wine, they made a repast with a
cheerfulness which might have attracted the envy of more splendid
tables. I should not omit that they found among their provision a little
paper containing a piece of gold, which Adams imagining had been put
there by mistake, would have returned back to restore it; but he was at
last convinced by Joseph that Mr Wilson had taken this handsome way of
furnishing them with a supply for their journey, on his having related
the distress which they had been in, when they were relieved by the
generosity of the pedlar. Adams said he was glad to see such an instance
of goodness, not so much for the conveniency which it brought them as
for the sake of the doer, whose reward would be great in heaven. He
likewise comforted himself with a reflection that he should shortly have
an opportunity of returning it him; for the gentleman was within a week
to make a journey into Somersetshire, to pass through Adams's parish,
and had faithfully promised to call on him; a circumstance which we
thought too immaterial to mention before; but which those who have as
great an affection for that gentleman as ourselves will rejoice at, as
it may give them hopes of seeing him again. Then Joseph made a speech on
charity, which the reader, if he is so disposed, may see in the next
chapter; for we scorn to betray him into any such reading, without first
giving him warning.



CHAPTER VI.

_Moral reflections by Joseph Andrews; with the hunting adventure, and
parson Adams's miraculous escape._


"I have often wondered, sir," said Joseph, "to observe so few instances
of charity among mankind; for though the goodness of a man's heart did
not incline him to relieve the distresses of his fellow-creatures,
methinks the desire of honour should move him to it. What inspires a man
to build fine houses, to purchase fine furniture, pictures, clothes, and
other things, at a great expense, but an ambition to be respected more
than other people? Now, would not one great act of charity, one instance
of redeeming a poor family from all the miseries of poverty, restoring
an unfortunate tradesman by a sum of money to the means of procuring a
livelihood by his industry, discharging an undone debtor from his debts
or a gaol, or any suchlike example of goodness, create a man more honour
and respect than he could acquire by the finest house, furniture,
pictures, or clothes, that were ever beheld? For not only the object
himself who was thus relieved, but all who heard the name of such a
person, must, I imagine, reverence him infinitely more than the
possessor of all those other things; which when we so admire, we rather
praise the builder, the workman, the painter, the lace-maker, the
taylor, and the rest, by whose ingenuity they are produced, than the
person who by his money makes them his own. For my own part, when I have
waited behind my lady in a room hung with fine pictures, while I have
been looking at them I have never once thought of their owner, nor hath
any one else, as I ever observed; for when it hath been asked whose
picture that was, it was never once answered the master's of the house;
but Ammyconni, Paul Varnish, Hannibal Scratchi, or Hogarthi, which I
suppose were the names of the painters; but if it was asked--Who
redeemed such a one out of prison? Who lent such a ruined tradesman
money to set up? Who clothed that family of poor small children? it is
very plain what must be the answer. And besides, these great folks are
mistaken if they imagine they get any honour at all by these means; for
I do not remember I ever was with my lady at any house where she
commended the house or furniture but I have heard her at her return home
make sport and jeer at whatever she had before commended; and I have
been told by other gentlemen in livery that it is the same in their
families: but I defy the wisest man in the world to turn a true good
action into ridicule. I defy him to do it. He who should endeavour it
would be laughed at himself, instead of making others laugh. Nobody
scarce doth any good, yet they all agree in praising those who do.
Indeed, it is strange that all men should consent in commending
goodness, and no man endeavour to deserve that commendation; whilst, on
the contrary, all rail at wickedness, and all are as eager to be what
they abuse. This I know not the reason of; but it is as plain as
daylight to those who converse in the world, as I have done these three
years." "Are all the great folks wicked then?" says Fanny. "To be sure
there are some exceptions," answered Joseph. "Some gentlemen of our
cloth report charitable actions done by their lords and masters; and I
have heard Squire Pope, the great poet, at my lady's table, tell stories
of a man that lived at a place called Ross, and another at the Bath, one
Al--Al--I forget his name, but it is in the book of verses. This
gentleman hath built up a stately house too, which the squire likes very
well; but his charity is seen farther than his house, though it stands
on a hill,--ay, and brings him more honour too. It was his charity that
put him in the book, where the squire says he puts all those who deserve
it; and to be sure, as he lives among all the great people, if there
were any such, he would know them." This was all of Mr Joseph Andrews's
speech which I could get him to recollect, which I have delivered as
near as was possible in his own words, with a very small embellishment.
But I believe the reader hath not been a little surprized at the long
silence of parson Adams, especially as so many occasions offered
themselves to exert his curiosity and observation. The truth is, he was
fast asleep, and had so been from the beginning of the preceding
narrative; and, indeed, if the reader considers that so many hours had
passed since he had closed his eyes, he will not wonder at his repose,
though even Henley himself, or as great an orator (if any such be), had
been in his rostrum or tub before him.

Joseph, who whilst he was speaking had continued in one attitude, with
his head reclining on one side, and his eyes cast on the ground, no
sooner perceived, on looking up, the position of Adams, who was
stretched on his back, and snored louder than the usual braying of the
animal with long ears, than he turned towards Fanny, and, taking her
by the hand, began a dalliance, which, though consistent with the
purest innocence and decency, neither he would have attempted nor she
permitted before any witness. Whilst they amused themselves in this
harmless and delightful manner they heard a pack of hounds approaching
in full cry towards them, and presently afterwards saw a hare pop
forth from the wood, and, crossing the water, land within a few yards
of them in the meadows. The hare was no sooner on shore than it seated
itself on its hinder legs, and listened to the sound of the pursuers.
Fanny was wonderfully pleased with the little wretch, and eagerly
longed to have it in her arms that she might preserve it from the
dangers which seemed to threaten it; but the rational part of the
creation do not always aptly distinguish their friends from their foes;
what wonder then if this silly creature, the moment it beheld her,
fled from the friend who would have protected it, and, traversing the
meadows again, passed the little rivulet on the opposite side? It was,
however, so spent and weak, that it fell down twice or thrice in its
way. This affected the tender heart of Fanny, who exclaimed, with tears
in her eyes, against the barbarity of worrying a poor innocent
defenceless animal out of its life, and putting it to the extremest
torture for diversion. She had not much time to make reflections of
this kind, for on a sudden the hounds rushed through the wood, which
resounded with their throats and the throats of their retinue, who
attended on them on horseback. The dogs now past the rivulet, and
pursued the footsteps of the hare; five horsemen attempted to leap
over, three of whom succeeded, and two were in the attempt thrown from
their saddles into the water; their companions, and their own horses
too, proceeded after their sport, and left their friends and riders to
invoke the assistance of Fortune, or employ the more active means of
strength and agility for their deliverance. Joseph, however, was not
so unconcerned on this occasion; he left Fanny for a moment to herself,
and ran to the gentlemen, who were immediately on their legs, shaking
their ears, and easily, with the help of his hand, obtained the bank
(for the rivulet was not at all deep); and, without staying to thank
their kind assister, ran dripping across the meadow, calling to their
brother sportsmen to stop their horses; but they heard them not.

The hounds were now very little behind their poor reeling, staggering
prey, which, fainting almost at every step, crawled through the wood,
and had almost got round to the place where Fanny stood, when it was
overtaken by its enemies, and being driven out of the covert, was
caught, and instantly tore to pieces before Fanny's face, who was unable
to assist it with any aid more powerful than pity; nor could she prevail
on Joseph, who had been himself a sportsman in his youth, to attempt
anything contrary to the laws of hunting in favour of the hare, which he
said was killed fairly.

The hare was caught within a yard or two of Adams, who lay asleep at
some distance from the lovers; and the hounds, in devouring it, and
pulling it backwards and forwards, had drawn it so close to him, that
some of them (by mistake perhaps for the hare's skin) laid hold of the
skirts of his cassock; others at the same time applying their teeth to
his wig, which he had with a handkerchief fastened to his head, began to
pull him about; and had not the motion of his body had more effect on
him than seemed to be wrought by the noise, they must certainly have
tasted his flesh, which delicious flavour might have been fatal to him;
but being roused by these tuggings, he instantly awaked, and with a jerk
delivering his head from his wig, he with most admirable dexterity
recovered his legs, which now seemed the only members he could entrust
his safety to. Having, therefore, escaped likewise from at least a third
part of his cassock, which he willingly left as his _exuviae_ or spoils
to the enemy, he fled with the utmost speed he could summon to his
assistance. Nor let this be any detraction from the bravery of his
character: let the number of the enemies, and the surprize in which he
was taken, be considered; and if there be any modern so outrageously
brave that he cannot admit of flight in any circumstance whatever, I say
(but I whisper that softly, and I solemnly declare without any intention
of giving offence to any brave man in the nation), I say, or rather I
whisper, that he is an ignorant fellow, and hath never read Homer nor
Virgil, nor knows he anything of Hector or Turnus; nay, he is
unacquainted with the history of some great men living, who, though as
brave as lions, ay, as tigers, have run away, the Lord knows how far,
and the Lord knows why, to the surprize of their friends and the
entertainment of their enemies. But if persons of such heroic
disposition are a little offended at the behaviour of Adams, we assure
them they shall be as much pleased with what we shall immediately relate
of Joseph Andrews. The master of the pack was just arrived, or, as the
sportsmen call it, come in, when Adams set out, as we have before
mentioned. This gentleman was generally said to be a great lover of
humour; but, not to mince the matter, especially as we are upon this
subject, he was a great hunter of men; indeed, he had hitherto followed
the sport only with dogs of his own species; for he kept two or three
couple of barking curs for that use only. However, as he thought he had
now found a man nimble enough, he was willing to indulge himself with
other sport, and accordingly, crying out, "Stole away," encouraged the
hounds to pursue Mr Adams, swearing it was the largest jack-hare he ever
saw; at the same time hallooing and hooping as if a conquered foe was
flying before him; in which he was imitated by these two or three couple
of human or rather two-legged curs on horseback which we have mentioned
before.

Now, thou, whoever thou art, whether a muse, or by what other name soever
thou choosest to be called, who presidest over biography, and hast
inspired all the writers of lives in these our times: thou who didst
infuse such wonderful humour into the pen of immortal Gulliver; who hast
carefully guided the judgment whilst thou hast exalted the nervous manly
style of thy Mallet: thou who hadst no hand in that dedication and
preface, or the translations, which thou wouldst willingly have struck
out of the life of Cicero: lastly, thou who, without the assistance of
the least spice of literature, and even against his inclination, hast,
in some pages of his book, forced Colley Cibber to write English; do
thou assist me in what I find myself unequal to. Do thou introduce on
the plain the young, the gay, the brave Joseph Andrews, whilst men shall
view him with admiration and envy, tender virgins with love and anxious
concern for his safety.

No sooner did Joseph Andrews perceive the distress of his friend, when
first the quick-scenting dogs attacked him, than he grasped his cudgel
in his right hand--a cudgel which his father had of his grandfather, to
whom a mighty strong man of Kent had given it for a present in that day
when he broke three heads on the stage. It was a cudgel of mighty
strength and wonderful art, made by one of Mr Deard's best workmen, whom
no other artificer can equal, and who hath made all those sticks which
the beaus have lately walked with about the Park in a morning; but this
was far his masterpiece. On its head was engraved a nose and chin, which
might have been mistaken for a pair of nutcrackers. The learned have
imagined it designed to represent the Gorgon; but it was in fact copied
from the face of a certain long English baronet, of infinite wit, humour,
and gravity. He did intend to have engraved here many histories: as the
first night of Captain B----'s play, where you would have seen critics
in embroidery transplanted from the boxes to the pit, whose ancient
inhabitants were exalted to the galleries, where they played on
catcalls. He did intend to have painted an auction room, where Mr Cock
would have appeared aloft in his pulpit, trumpeting forth the praises of
a china basin, and with astonishment wondering that "Nobody bids more
for that fine, that superb--" He did intend to have engraved many other
things, but was forced to leave all out for want of room.

No sooner had Joseph grasped his cudgel in his hands than lightning
darted from his eyes; and the heroick youth, swift of foot, ran with the
utmost speed to his friend's assistance. He overtook him just as
Rockwood had laid hold of the skirt of his cassock, which, being torn,
hung to the ground. Reader, we would make a simile on this occasion, but
for two reasons: the first is, it would interrupt the description, which
should be rapid in this part; but that doth not weigh much, many
precedents occurring for such an interruption: the second and much the
greater reason is, that we could find no simile adequate to our purpose:
for indeed, what instance could we bring to set before our reader's eyes
at once the idea of friendship, courage, youth, beauty, strength, and
swiftness? all which blazed in the person of Joseph Andrews. Let those,
therefore, that describe lions and tigers, and heroes fiercer than both,
raise their poems or plays with the simile of Joseph Andrews, who is
himself above the reach of any simile.

Now Rockwood had laid fast hold on the parson's skirts, and stopt his
flight; which Joseph no sooner perceived than he levelled his cudgel at
his head and laid him sprawling. Jowler and Ringwood then fell on his
greatcoat, and had undoubtedly brought him to the ground, had not
Joseph, collecting all his force, given Jowler such a rap on the back,
that, quitting his hold, he ran howling over the plain. A harder fate
remained for thee, O Ringwood! Ringwood the best hound that ever pursued
a hare, who never threw his tongue but where the scent was undoubtedly
true; good at trailing, and sure in a highway; no babler, no overrunner;
respected by the whole pack, who, whenever he opened, knew the game was
at hand. He fell by the stroke of Joseph. Thunder and Plunder, and
Wonder and Blunder, were the next victims of his wrath, and measured
their lengths on the ground. Then Fairmaid, a bitch which Mr John Temple
had bred up in his house, and fed at his own table, and lately sent the
squire fifty miles for a present, ran fiercely at Joseph and bit him by
the leg: no dog was ever fiercer than she, being descended from an
Amazonian breed, and had worried bulls in her own country, but now waged
an unequal fight, and had shared the fate of those we have mentioned
before, had not Diana (the reader may believe it or not if he pleases)
in that instant interposed, and, in the shape of the huntsman, snatched
her favourite up in her arms.

The parson now faced about, and with his crabstick felled many to the
earth, and scattered others, till he was attacked by Caesar and pulled
to the ground. Then Joseph flew to his rescue, and with such might
fell on the victor, that, O eternal blot to his name! Caesar ran
yelping away.

The battle now raged with the most dreadful violence, when, lo! the
huntsman, a man of years and dignity, lifted his voice, and called his
hounds from the fight, telling them, in a language they understood, that
it was in vain to contend longer, for that fate had decreed the victory
to their enemies.

Thus far the muse hath with her usual dignity related this prodigious
battle, a battle we apprehend never equalled by any poet, romance or
life writer whatever, and, having brought it to a conclusion, she
ceased; we shall therefore proceed in our ordinary style with the
continuation of this history. The squire and his companions, whom the
figure of Adams and the gallantry of Joseph had at first thrown into a
violent fit of laughter, and who had hitherto beheld the engagement with
more delight than any chase, shooting-match, race, cock-fighting, bull
or bear baiting, had ever given them, began now to apprehend the danger
of their hounds, many of which lay sprawling in the fields. The squire,
therefore, having first called his friends about him, as guards for
safety of his person, rode manfully up to the combatants, and, summoning
all the terror he was master of into his countenance, demanded with an
authoritative voice of Joseph what he meant by assaulting his dogs in
that manner? Joseph answered, with great intrepidity, that they had
first fallen on his friend; and if they had belonged to the greatest man
in the kingdom, he would have treated them in the same way; for, whilst
his veins contained a single drop of blood, he would not stand idle by
and see that gentleman (pointing to Adams) abused either by man or
beast; and, having so said, both he and Adams brandished their wooden
weapons, and put themselves into such a posture, that the squire and his
company thought proper to preponderate before they offered to revenge
the cause of their four-footed allies.

At this instant Fanny, whom the apprehension of Joseph's danger had
alarmed so much that, forgetting her own, she had made the utmost
expedition, came up. The squire and all the horsemen were so
surprized with her beauty, that they immediately fixed both their
eyes and thoughts solely on her, every one declaring he had never
seen so charming a creature. Neither mirth nor anger engaged them a
moment longer, but all sat in silent amaze. The huntsman only was
free from her attraction, who was busy in cutting the ears of the
dogs, and endeavouring to recover them to life; in which he succeeded
so well, that only two of no great note remained slaughtered on the
field of action. Upon this the huntsman declared, "'Twas well it was
no worse; for his part he could not blame the gentleman, and wondered
his master would encourage the dogs to hunt Christians; that it was
the surest way to spoil them, to make them follow vermin instead of
sticking to a hare."

The squire, being informed of the little mischief that had been done,
and perhaps having more mischief of another kind in his head, accosted
Mr Adams with a more favourable aspect than before: he told him he was
sorry for what had happened; that he had endeavoured all he could to
prevent it the moment he was acquainted with his cloth, and greatly
commended the courage of his servant, for so he imagined Joseph to be.
He then invited Mr Adams to dinner, and desired the young woman might
come with him. Adams refused a long while; but the invitation was
repeated with so much earnestness and courtesy, that at length he was
forced to accept it. His wig and hat, and other spoils of the field,
being gathered together by Joseph (for otherwise probably they would
have been forgotten), he put himself into the best order he could; and
then the horse and foot moved forward in the same pace towards the
squire's house, which stood at a very little distance.

Whilst they were on the road the lovely Fanny attracted the eyes of all:
they endeavoured to outvie one another in encomiums on her beauty; which
the reader will pardon my not relating, as they had not anything new or
uncommon in them: so must he likewise my not setting down the many
curious jests which were made on Adams; some of them declaring that
parson-hunting was the best sport in the world; others commending his
standing at bay, which they said he had done as well as any badger; with
such like merriment, which, though it would ill become the dignity of
this history, afforded much laughter and diversion to the squire and his
facetious companions.



CHAPTER VII.

_A scene of roasting, very nicely adapted to the present taste
and times._


They arrived at the squire's house just as his dinner was ready. A
little dispute arose on the account of Fanny, whom the squire, who was a
bachelor, was desirous to place at his own table; but she would not
consent, nor would Mr Adams permit her to be parted from Joseph; so that
she was at length with him consigned over to the kitchen, where the
servants were ordered to make him drunk; a favour which was likewise
intended for Adams; which design being executed, the squire thought he
should easily accomplish what he had when he first saw her intended to
perpetrate with Fanny.

It may not be improper, before we proceed farther, to open a little the
character of this gentleman, and that of his friends. The master of this
house, then, was a man of a very considerable fortune; a bachelor, as we
have said, and about forty years of age: he had been educated (if we may
use the expression) in the country, and at his own home, under the care
of his mother, and a tutor who had orders never to correct him, nor to
compel him to learn more than he liked, which it seems was very little,
and that only in his childhood; for from the age of fifteen he addicted
himself entirely to hunting and other rural amusements, for which his
mother took care to equip him with horses, hounds, and all other
necessaries; and his tutor, endeavouring to ingratiate himself with his
young pupil, who would, he knew, be able handsomely to provide for him,
became his companion, not only at these exercises, but likewise over a
bottle, which the young squire had a very early relish for. At the age
of twenty his mother began to think she had not fulfilled the duty of a
parent; she therefore resolved to persuade her son, if possible, to that
which she imagined would well supply all that he might have learned at a
public school or university--this is what they commonly call travelling;
which, with the help of the tutor, who was fixed on to attend him, she
easily succeeded in. He made in three years the tour of Europe, as they
term it, and returned home well furnished with French clothes, phrases,
and servants, with a hearty contempt for his own country; especially
what had any savour of the plain spirit and honesty of our ancestors.
His mother greatly applauded herself at his return. And now, being
master of his own fortune, he soon procured himself a seat in
Parliament, and was in the common opinion one of the finest gentlemen of
his age: but what distinguished him chiefly was a strange delight which
he took in everything which is ridiculous, odious, and absurd in his own
species; so that he never chose a companion without one or more of these
ingredients, and those who were marked by nature in the most eminent
degree with them were most his favourites. If he ever found a man who
either had not, or endeavoured to conceal, these imperfections, he took
great pleasure in inventing methods of forcing him into absurdities
which were not natural to him, or in drawing forth and exposing those
that were; for which purpose he was always provided with a set of
fellows, whom we have before called curs, and who did, indeed, no great
honour to the canine kind; their business was to hunt out and display
everything that had any savour of the above-mentioned qualities, and
especially in the gravest and best characters; but if they failed in
their search, they were to turn even virtue and wisdom themselves into
ridicule, for the diversion of their master and feeder. The gentlemen of
curlike disposition who were now at his house, and whom he had brought
with him from London, were, an old half-pay officer, a player, a dull
poet, a quack-doctor, a scraping fiddler, and a lame German
dancing-master.

As soon as dinner was served, while Mr Adams was saying grace, the
captain conveyed his chair from behind him; so that when he endeavoured
to seat himself he fell down on the ground, and this completed joke the
first, to the great entertainment of the whole company. The second joke
was performed by the poet, who sat next him on the other side, and took
an opportunity, while poor Adams was respectfully drinking to the master
of the house, to overturn a plate of soup into his breeches; which, with
the many apologies he made, and the parson's gentle answers, caused much
mirth in the company. Joke the third was served up by one of the
waiting-men, who had been ordered to convey a quantity of gin into Mr
Adams's ale, which he declaring to be the best liquor he ever drank, but
rather too rich of the malt, contributed again to their laughter. Mr
Adams, from whom we had most of this relation, could not recollect all
the jests of this kind practised on him, which the inoffensive
disposition of his own heart made him slow in discovering; and indeed,
had it not been for the information which we received from a servant of
the family, this part of our history, which we take to be none of the
least curious, must have been deplorably imperfect; though we must own
it probable that some more jokes were (as they call it) cracked during
their dinner; but we have by no means been able to come at the knowledge
of them. When dinner was removed, the poet began to repeat some verses,
which, he said, were made extempore. The following is a copy of them,
procured with the greatest difficulty:--

    _An extempore Poem on parson Adams._

    Did ever mortal such a parson view?
    His cassock old, his wig not over-new,
    Well might the hounds have him for fox mistaken,
    In smell more like to that than rusty bacon[A];
    But would it not make any mortal stare
    To see this parson taken for a hare?
    Could Phoebus err thus grossly, even he
    For a good player might have taken thee.

[A] All hounds that will hunt fox or other vermin will hunt a piece of
    rusty bacon trailed on the ground.

At which words the bard whipt off the player's wig, and received the
approbation of the company, rather perhaps for the dexterity of his hand
than his head. The player, instead of retorting the jest on the poet,
began to display his talents on the same subject. He repeated many
scraps of wit out of plays, reflecting on the whole body of the clergy,
which were received with great acclamations by all present. It was now
the dancing-master's turn to exhibit his talents; he therefore,
addressing himself to Adams in broken English, told him, "He was a man
ver well made for de dance, and he suppose by his walk dat he had learn
of some great master." He said, "It was ver pretty quality in clergyman
to dance;" and concluded with desiring him to dance a minuet, telling
him, "his cassock would serve for petticoats; and that he would himself
be his partner." At which words, without waiting for an answer, he
pulled out his gloves, and the fiddler was preparing his fiddle. The
company all offered the dancing-master wagers that the parson out-danced
him, which he refused, saying "he believed so too, for he had never seen
any man in his life who looked de dance so well as de gentleman:" he
then stepped forwards to take Adams by the hand, which the latter
hastily withdrew, and, at the same time clenching his fist, advised him
not to carry the jest too far, for he would not endure being put upon.
The dancing-master no sooner saw the fist than he prudently retired out
of its reach, and stood aloof, mimicking Adams, whose eyes were fixed on
him, not guessing what he was at, but to avoid his laying hold on him,
which he had once attempted. In the meanwhile, the captain, perceiving
an opportunity, pinned a cracker or devil to the cassock, and then
lighted it with their little smoking-candle. Adams, being a stranger to
this sport, and believing he had been blown up in reality, started from
his chair, and jumped about the room, to the infinite joy of the
beholders, who declared he was the best dancer in the universe. As soon
as the devil had done tormenting him, and he had a little recovered his
confusion, he returned to the table, standing up in the posture of one
who intended to make a speech. They all cried out, "Hear him, hear him;"
and he then spoke in the following manner: "Sir, I am sorry to see one
to whom Providence hath been so bountiful in bestowing his favours make
so ill and ungrateful a return for them; for, though you have not
insulted me yourself, it is visible you have delighted in those that do
it, nor have once discouraged the many rudenesses which have been shown
towards me; indeed, towards yourself, if you rightly understood them;
for I am your guest, and by the laws of hospitality entitled to your
protection. One gentleman had thought proper to produce some poetry upon
me, of which I shall only say, that I had rather be the subject than the
composer. He hath pleased to treat me with disrespect as a parson. I
apprehend my order is not the subject of scorn, nor that I can become
so, unless by being a disgrace to it, which I hope poverty will never be
called. Another gentleman, indeed, hath repeated some sentences, where
the order itself is mentioned with contempt. He says they are taken from
plays. I am sure such plays are a scandal to the government which
permits them, and cursed will be the nation where they are represented.
How others have treated me I need not observe; they themselves, when
they reflect, must allow the behaviour to be as improper to my years as
to my cloth. You found me, sir, travelling with two of my parishioners
(I omit your hounds falling on me; for I have quite forgiven it, whether
it proceeded from the wantonness or negligence of the huntsman): my
appearance might very well persuade you that your invitation was an act
of charity, though in reality we were well provided; yes, sir, if we had
had an hundred miles to travel, we had sufficient to bear our expenses
in a noble manner." (At which words he produced the half-guinea which
was found in the basket.) "I do not show you this out of ostentation of
riches, but to convince you I speak truth. Your seating me at your table
was an honour which I did not ambitiously affect. When I was here, I
endeavoured to behave towards you with the utmost respect; if I have
failed, it was not with design; nor could I, certainly, so far be guilty
as to deserve the insults I have suffered. If they were meant,
therefore, either to my order or my poverty (and you see I am not very
poor), the shame doth not lie at my door, and I heartily pray that the
sin may be averted from yours." He thus finished, and received a general
clap from the whole company. Then the gentleman of the house told him,
"He was sorry for what had happened; that he could not accuse him of any
share in it; that the verses were, as himself had well observed, so bad,
that he might easily answer them; and for the serpent, it was
undoubtedly a very great affront done him by the dancing-master, for
which, if he well thrashed him, as he deserved, he should be very much
pleased to see it" (in which, probably, he spoke truth). Adams answered,
"Whoever had done it, it was not his profession to punish him that way;
but for the person whom he had accused, I am a witness," says he, "of
his innocence; for I had my eye on him all the while. Whoever he was,
God forgive him, and bestow on him a little more sense as well as
humanity." The captain answered with a surly look and accent, "That he
hoped he did not mean to reflect upon him; d--n him, he had as much
imanity as another, and, if any man said he had not, he would convince
him of his mistake by cutting his throat." Adams, smiling, said, "He
believed he had spoke right by accident." To which the captain returned,
"What do you mean by my speaking right? If you was not a parson, I would
not take these words; but your gown protects you. If any man who wears a
sword had said so much, I had pulled him by the nose before this." Adams
replied, "If he attempted any rudeness to his person, he would not find
any protection for himself in his gown;" and, clenching his fist,
declared "he had thrashed many a stouter man." The gentleman did all he
could to encourage this warlike disposition in Adams, and was in hopes
to have produced a battle, but he was disappointed; for the captain made
no other answer than, "It is very well you are a parson;" and so,
drinking off a bumper to old mother Church, ended the dispute.

Then the doctor, who had hitherto been silent, and who was the gravest
but most mischievous dog of all, in a very pompous speech highly
applauded what Adams had said, and as much discommended the behaviour
to him. He proceeded to encomiums on the Church and poverty; and,
lastly, recommended forgiveness of what had passed to Adams, who
immediately answered, "That everything was forgiven;" and in the warmth
of his goodness he filled a bumper of strong beer (a liquor he
preferred to wine), and drank a health to the whole company, shaking
the captain and the poet heartily by the hand, and addressing himself
with great respect to the doctor; who, indeed, had not laughed
outwardly at anything that past, as he had a perfect command of his
muscles, and could laugh inwardly without betraying the least symptoms
in his countenance. The doctor now began a second formal speech, in
which he declaimed against all levity of conversation, and what is
usually called mirth. He said, "There were amusements fitted for
persons of all ages and degrees, from the rattle to the discussing a
point of philosophy; and that men discovered themselves in nothing more
than in the choice of their amusements; for," says he, "as it must
greatly raise our expectation of the future conduct in life of boys
whom in their tender years we perceive, instead of taw or balls, or
other childish playthings, to chuse, at their leisure hours, to
exercise their genius in contentions of wit, learning, and such like;
so must it inspire one with equal contempt of a man, if we should
discover him playing at taw or other childish play." Adams highly
commended the doctor's opinion, and said, "He had often wondered at
some passages in ancient authors, where Scipio, Laelius, and other great
men were represented to have passed many hours in amusements of the
most trifling kind." The doctor replied, "He had by him an old Greek
manuscript where a favourite diversion of Socrates was recorded." "Ay!"
says the parson eagerly; "I should be most infinitely obliged to you
for the favour of perusing it." The doctor promised to send it him, and
farther said, "That he believed he could describe it. I think," says
he, "as near as I can remember, it was this: there was a throne
erected, on one side of which sat a king and on the other a queen, with
their guards and attendants ranged on both sides; to them was
introduced an ambassador, which part Socrates always used to perform
himself; and when he was led up to the footsteps of the throne he
addressed himself to the monarchs in some grave speech, full of virtue,
and goodness, and morality, and such like. After which, he was seated
between the king and queen, and royally entertained. This I think was
the chief part. Perhaps I may have forgot some particulars; for it is
long since I read it." Adams said, "It was, indeed, a diversion worthy
the relaxation of so great a man; and thought something resembling it
should be instituted among our great men, instead of cards and other
idle pastime, in which, he was informed, they trifled away too much of
their lives." He added, "The Christian religion was a nobler subject
for these speeches than any Socrates could have invented." The
gentleman of the house approved what Mr Adams said, and declared "he
was resolved to perform the ceremony this very evening." To which the
doctor objected, as no one was prepared with a speech, "unless," said
he (turning to Adams with a gravity of countenance which would have
deceived a more knowing man), "you have a sermon about you, doctor."
"Sir," said Adams, "I never travel without one, for fear of what may
happen." He was easily prevailed on by his worthy friend, as he now
called the doctor, to undertake the part of the ambassador; so that the
gentleman sent immediate orders to have the throne erected, which was
performed before they had drank two bottles; and, perhaps, the reader
will hereafter have no great reason to admire the nimbleness of the
servants. Indeed, to confess the truth, the throne was no more than
this: there was a great tub of water provided, on each side of which
were placed two stools raised higher than the surface of the tub, and
over the whole was laid a blanket; on these stools were placed the king
and queen, namely, the master of the house and the captain. And now the
ambassador was introduced between the poet and the doctor; who, having
read his sermon, to the great entertainment of all present, was led up
to his place and seated between their majesties. They immediately rose
up, when the blanket, wanting its supports at either end, gave way, and
soused Adams over head and ears in the water. The captain made his
escape, but, unluckily, the gentleman himself not being as nimble as he
ought, Adams caught hold of him before he descended from his throne,
and pulled him in with him, to the entire secret satisfaction of all
the company. Adams, after ducking the squire twice or thrice, leapt out
of the tub, and looked sharp for the doctor, whom he would certainly
have conveyed to the same place of honour; but he had wisely withdrawn:
he then searched for his crabstick, and having found that, as well as
his fellow travellers, he declared he would not stay a moment longer in
such a house. He then departed, without taking leave of his host, whom
he had exacted a more severe revenge on than he intended; for, as he
did not use sufficient care to dry himself in time, he caught a cold by
the accident which threw him into a fever that had like to have cost
him his life.



CHAPTER VIII.

_Which some readers will think too short and others too long._


Adams, and Joseph, who was no less enraged than his friend at the
treatment he met with, went out with their sticks in their hands, and
carried off Fanny, notwithstanding the opposition of the servants, who
did all, without proceeding to violence, in their power to detain them.
They walked as fast as they could, not so much from any apprehension of
being pursued as that Mr Adams might, by exercise, prevent any harm from
the water. The gentleman, who had given such orders to his servants
concerning Fanny that he did not in the least fear her getting away, no
sooner heard that she was gone, than he began to rave, and immediately
despatched several with orders either to bring her back or never return.
The poet, the player, and all but the dancing-master and doctor, went on
this errand.

The night was very dark in which our friends began their journey;
however, they made such expedition, that they soon arrived at an inn
which was at seven miles' distance. Here they unanimously consented to
pass the evening, Mr Adams being now as dry as he was before he had set
out on his embassy.

This inn, which indeed we might call an ale-house, had not the words,
The New Inn, been writ on the sign, afforded them no better provision
than bread and cheese and ale; on which, however, they made a very
comfortable meal; for hunger is better than a French cook.

They had no sooner supped, than Adams, returning thanks to the Almighty
for his food, declared he had eat his homely commons with much greater
satisfaction than his splendid dinner; and expressed great contempt for
the folly of mankind, who sacrificed their hopes of heaven to the
acquisition of vast wealth, since so much comfort was to be found in the
humblest state and the lowest provision. "Very true, sir," says a grave
man who sat smoaking his pipe by the fire, and who was a traveller as
well as himself. "I have often been as much surprized as you are, when I
consider the value which mankind in general set on riches, since every
day's experience shows us how little is in their power; for what,
indeed, truly desirable, can they bestow on us? Can they give beauty to
the deformed, strength to the weak, or health to the infirm? Surely if
they could we should not see so many ill-favoured faces haunting the
assemblies of the great, nor would such numbers of feeble wretches
languish in their coaches and palaces. No, not the wealth of a kingdom
can purchase any paint to dress pale Ugliness in the bloom of that young
maiden, nor any drugs to equip Disease with the vigour of that young
man. Do not riches bring us to solicitude instead of rest, envy instead
of affection, and danger instead of safety? Can they prolong their own
possession, or lengthen his days who enjoys them? So far otherwise, that
the sloth, the luxury, the care which attend them, shorten the lives of
millions, and bring them with pain and misery to an untimely grave.
Where, then, is their value if they can neither embellish nor strengthen
our forms, sweeten nor prolong our lives?--Again: Can they adorn the
mind more than the body? Do they not rather swell the heart with vanity,
puff up the cheeks with pride, shut our ears to every call of virtue,
and our bowels to every motive of compassion?" "Give me your hand,
brother," said Adams, in a rapture, "for I suppose you are a
clergyman."--"No, truly," answered the other (indeed, he was a priest of
the Church of Rome; but those who understand our laws will not wonder he
was not over-ready to own it).--"Whatever you are," cries Adams, "you
have spoken my sentiments: I believe I have preached every syllable of
your speech twenty times over; for it hath always appeared to me easier
for a cable-rope (which by the way is the true rendering of that word we
have translated camel) to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to get into the kingdom of heaven."--"That, sir," said the other,
"will be easily granted you by divines, and is deplorably true; but as
the prospect of our good at a distance doth not so forcibly affect us,
it might be of some service to mankind to be made thoroughly
sensible--which I think they might be with very little serious
attention--that even the blessings of this world are not to be purchased
with riches; a doctrine, in my opinion, not only metaphysically, but, if
I may so say, mathematically demonstrable; and which I have been always
so perfectly convinced of that I have a contempt for nothing so much as
for gold." Adams now began a long discourse: but as most which he said
occurs among many authors who have treated this subject, I shall omit
inserting it. During its continuance Joseph and Fanny retired to rest,
and the host likewise left the room. When the English parson had
concluded, the Romish resumed the discourse, which he continued with
great bitterness and invective; and at last ended by desiring Adams to
lend him eighteen-pence to pay his reckoning; promising, if he never
paid him, he might be assured of his prayers. The good man answered that
eighteen-pence would be too little to carry him any very long journey;
that he had half a guinea in his pocket, which he would divide with him.
He then fell to searching his pockets, but could find no money; for
indeed the company with whom he dined had passed one jest upon him which
we did not then enumerate, and had picked his pocket of all that
treasure which he had so ostentatiously produced.

"Bless me!" cried Adams, "I have certainly lost it; I can never have
spent it. Sir, as I am a Christian, I had a whole half-guinea in my
pocket this morning, and have not now a single halfpenny of it left.
Sure the devil must have taken it from me!"--"Sir," answered the priest,
smiling, "you need make no excuses; if you are not willing to lend me
the money, I am contented."--"Sir," cries Adams, "if I had the greatest
sum in the world--aye, if I had ten pounds about me--I would bestow it
all to rescue any Christian from distress. I am more vexed at my loss on
your account than my own. Was ever anything so unlucky? Because I have
no money in my pocket I shall be suspected to be no Christian."--"I am
more unlucky," quoth the other, "if you are as generous a
but to delude, not delight her; for, before she could reach the promised
happiness, it vanished, and left her to curse, not bless, the vision.

She started from her sleep, her imagination being all on fire with the
phantom, when, her eyes accidentally glancing towards the spot where
yesterday the real Joseph had stood, that little circumstance raised his
idea in the liveliest colours in her memory. Each look, each word, each
gesture rushed back on her mind with charms which all his coldness could
not abate. Nay, she imputed that to his youth, his folly, his awe, his
religion, to everything but what would instantly have produced contempt,
want of passion for the sex, or that which would have roused her hatred,
want of liking to her.

Reflection then hurried her farther, and told her she must see this
beautiful youth no more; nay, suggested to her that she herself had
dismissed him for no other fault than probably that of too violent an
awe and respect for herself; and which she ought rather to have esteemed
a merit, the effects of which were besides so easily and surely to have
been removed; she then blamed, she cursed the hasty rashness of her
temper; her fury was vented all on herself, and Joseph appeared innocent
in her eyes. Her passion at length grew so violent, that it forced her
on seeking relief, and now she thought of recalling him: but pride
forbad that; pride, which soon drove all softer passions from her soul,
and represented to her the meanness of him she was fond of. That thought
soon began to obscure his beauties; contempt succeeded next, and then
disdain, which presently introduced her hatred of the creature who had
given her so much uneasiness. These enemies of Joseph had no sooner
taken possession of her mind than they insinuated to her a thousand
things in his disfavour; everything but dislike of her person; a thought
which, as it would have been intolerable to bear, she checked the moment
it endeavoured to arise. Revenge came now to her assistance; and she
considered her dismission of him, stript, and without a character, with
the utmost pleasure. She rioted in the several kinds of misery which her
imagination suggested to her might be his fate; and, with a smile
composed of anger, mirth, and scorn, viewed him in the rags in which her
fancy had drest him.

Mrs Slipslop, being summoned, attended her mistress, who had now in her
own opinion totally subdued this passion. Whilst she was dressing she
asked if that fellow had been turned away according to her orders.
Slipslop answered, she had told her ladyship so (as indeed she
had).--"And how did he behave?" replied the lady. "Truly, madam," cries
Slipslop, "in such a manner that infected everybody who saw him. The
poor lad had but little wages to receive; for he constantly allowed his
father and mother half his income; so that, when your ladyship's livery
was stript off, he had not wherewithal to buy a coat, and must have gone
naked if one of the footmen had not incommodated him with one; and
whilst he was standing in his shirt (and, to say truth, he was an
amorous figure), being told your ladyship would not give him a
character, he sighed, and said he had done nothing willingly to offend;
that for his part, he should always give your ladyship a good character
wherever he went; and he prayed God to bless you; for you was the best
of ladies, though his enemies had set you against him. I wish you had
not turned him away; for I believe you have not a faithfuller servant in
the house."--"How came you then," replied the lady, "to advise me to
turn him away?"--"I, madam!" said Slipslop; "I am sure you will do me
the justice to say, I did all in my power to prevent it; but I saw your
ladyship was angry; and it is not the business of us upper servants to
hinterfear on these occasions." "And was it not you, audacious wretch!"
cried the lady, "who made me angry? Was it not your tittle-tattle, in
which I believe you belyed the poor fellow, which incensed me against
him? He may thank you for all that hath happened; and so may I for the
loss of a good servant, and one who probably had more merit than all of
you. Poor fellow! I am charmed with his goodness to his parents. Why did
not you tell me of that, but suffer me to dismiss so good a creature
without a character? I see the reason of your whole behaviour now as
well as your complaint; you was jealous of the wenches." "I jealous!"
said Slipslop; "I assure you, I look upon myself as his betters; I am
not meat for a footman, I hope." These words threw the lady into a
violent passion, and she sent Slipslop from her presence, who departed,
tossing her nose, and crying, "Marry, come up! there are some people
more jealous than I, I believe." Her lady affected not to hear the
words, though in reality she did, and understood them too. Now ensued a
second conflict, so like the former, that it might savour of repetition
to relate it minutely. It may suffice to say that Lady Booby found good
reason to doubt whether she had so absolutely conquered her passion as
she had flattered herself; and, in order to accomplish it quite, took a
resolution, more common than wise, to retire immediately into the
country. The reader hath long ago seen the arrival of Mrs Slipslop, whom
no pertness could make her mistress resolve to part with; lately, that
of Mr Pounce, her forerunners; and, lastly, that of the lady herself.

The morning after her arrival being Sunday, she went to church, to the
great surprize of everybody, who wondered to see her ladyship, being no
very constant church-woman, there so suddenly upon her journey. Joseph
was likewise there; and I have heard it was remarked that she fixed her
eyes on him much more than on the parson; but this I believe to be only
a malicious rumour. When the prayers were ended Mr Adams stood up, and
with a loud voice pronounced, "I publish the banns of marriage between
Joseph Andrews and Frances Goodwill, both of this parish," &c. Whether
this had any effect on Lady Booby or no, who was then in her pew, which
the congregation could not see into, I could never discover: but
certain it is that in about a quarter of an hour she stood up, and
directed her eyes to that part of the church where the women sat, and
persisted in looking that way during the remainder of the sermon in so
scrutinizing a manner, and with so angry a countenance, that most of
the women were afraid she was offended at them. The moment she returned
home she sent for Slipslop into her chamber, and told her she wondered
what that impudent fellow Joseph did in that parish? Upon which
Slipslop gave her an account of her meeting Adams with him on the road,
and likewise the adventure with Fanny. At the relation of which the
lady often changed her countenance; and when she had heard all, she
ordered Mr Adams into her presence, to whom she behaved as the reader
will see in the next chapter.



CHAPTER II.

_A dialogue between Mr Abraham Adams and the Lady Booby._


Mr Adams was not far off, for he was drinking her ladyship's health
below in a cup of her ale. He no sooner came before her than she began
in the following manner: "I wonder, sir, after the many great
obligations you have had to this family" (with all which the reader hath
in the course of this history been minutely acquainted), "that you will
ungratefully show any respect to a fellow who hath been turned out of it
for his misdeeds. Nor doth it, I can tell you, sir, become a man of your
character, to run about the country with an idle fellow and wench.
Indeed, as for the girl, I know no harm of her. Slipslop tells me she
was formerly bred up in my house, and behaved as she ought, till she
hankered after this fellow, and he spoiled her. Nay, she may still,
perhaps, do very well, if he will let her alone. You are, therefore,
doing a monstrous thing in endeavouring to procure a match between these
two people, which will be to the ruin of them both."--"Madam," said
Adams, "if your ladyship will but hear me speak, I protest I never heard
any harm of Mr Joseph Andrews; if I had, I should have corrected him for
it; for I never have, nor will, encourage the faults of those under my
care. As for the young woman, I assure your ladyship I have as good an
opinion of her as your ladyship yourself or any other can have. She is
the sweetest-tempered, honestest, worthiest young creature; indeed, as
to her beauty, I do not commend her on that account, though all men
allow she is the handsomest woman, gentle or simple, that ever appeared
in the parish."--"You are very impertinent," says she, "to talk such
fulsome stuff to me. It is mighty becoming truly in a clergyman to
trouble himself about handsome women, and you are a delicate judge of
beauty, no doubt. A man who hath lived all his life in such a parish as
this is a rare judge of beauty! Ridiculous! beauty indeed! a country
wench a beauty! I shall be sick whenever I hear beauty mentioned again.
And so this wench is to stock the parish with beauties, I hope. But,
sir, our poor is numerous enough already; I will have no more vagabonds
settled here."--"Madam," says Adams, "your ladyship is offended with me,
I protest, without any reason. This couple were desirous to consummate
long ago, and I dissuaded them from it; nay, I may venture to say, I
believe I was the sole cause of their delaying it."--"Well," says she,
"and you did very wisely and honestly too, notwithstanding she is the
greatest beauty in the parish."--"And now, madam," continued he, "I only
perform my office to Mr Joseph."--"Pray, don't mister such fellows to
me," cries the lady. "He," said the parson, "with the consent of Fanny,
before my face, put in the banns." "Yes," answered the lady, "I suppose
the slut is forward enough; Slipslop tells me how her head runs upon
fellows; that is one of her beauties, I suppose. But if they have put in
the banns, I desire you will publish them no more without my
orders."--"Madam," cries Adams, "if any one puts in a sufficient
caution, and assigns a proper reason against them, I am willing to
surcease."--"I tell you a reason," says she: "he is a vagabond, and he
shall not settle here, and bring a nest of beggars into the parish; it
will make us but little amends that they will be beauties."--"Madam,"
answered Adams, "with the utmost submission to your ladyship, I have been
informed by lawyer Scout that any person who serves a year gains a
settlement in the parish where he serves."--"Lawyer Scout," replied the
lady, "is an impudent coxcomb; I will have no lawyer Scout interfere
with me. I repeat to you again, I will have no more incumbrances brought
on us: so I desire you will proceed no farther."--"Madam," returned
Adams, "I would obey your ladyship in everything that is lawful; but
surely the parties being poor is no reason against their marrying. God
forbid there should be any such law! The poor have little share enough
of this world already; it would be barbarous indeed to deny them the
common privileges and innocent enjoyments which nature indulges to the
animal creation."--"Since you understand yourself no better," cries the
lady, "nor the respect due from such as you to a woman of my
distinction, than to affront my ears by such loose discourse, I shall
mention but one short word; it is my orders to you that you publish
these banns no more; and if you dare, I will recommend it to your
master, the doctor, to discard you from his service. I will, sir,
notwithstanding your poor family; and then you and the greatest beauty
in the parish may go and beg together."--"Madam," answered Adams, "I
know not what your ladyship means by the terms master and service. I am
in the service of a Master who will never discard me for doing my duty;
and if the doctor (for indeed I have never been able to pay for a
licence) thinks proper to turn me from my cure, God will provide me, I
hope, another. At least, my family, as well as myself, have hands; and
he will prosper, I doubt not, our endeavours to get our bread honestly
with them. Whilst my conscience is pure, I shall never fear what man can
do unto me."--"I condemn my humility," said the lady, "for demeaning
myself to converse with you so long. I shall take other measures; for I
see you are a confederate with them. But the sooner you leave me the
better; and I shall give orders that my doors may no longer be open to
you. I will suffer no parsons who run about the country with beauties to
be entertained here."--"Madam," said Adams, "I shall enter into no
persons' doors against their will; but I am assured, when you have
enquired farther into this matter, you will applaud, not blame, my
proceeding; and so I humbly take my leave:" which he did with many bows,
or at least many attempts at a bow.



CHAPTER III.

_What passed between the lady and lawyer Scout._


In the afternoon the lady sent for Mr Scout, whom she attacked most
violently for intermeddling with her servants, which he denied, and
indeed with truth, for he had only asserted accidentally, and perhaps
rightly, that a year's service gained a settlement; and so far he owned
he might have formerly informed the parson and believed it was law. "I
am resolved," said the lady, "to have no discarded servants of mine
settled here; and so, if this be your law, I shall send to another
lawyer." Scout said, "If she sent to a hundred lawyers, not one or all
of them could alter the law. The utmost that was in the power of a
lawyer was to prevent the law's taking effect; and that he himself could
do for her ladyship as well as any other; and I believe," says he,
"madam, your ladyship, not being conversant in these matters, hath
mistaken a difference; for I asserted only that a man who served a year
was settled. Now there is a material difference between being settled in
law and settled in fact; and as I affirmed generally he was settled, and
law is preferable to fact, my settlement must be understood in law and
not in fact. And suppose, madam, we admit he was settled in law, what
use will they make of it? how doth that relate to fact? He is not
settled in fact; and if he be not settled in fact, he is not an
inhabitant; and if he is not an inhabitant, he is not of this parish;
and then undoubtedly he ought not to be published here; for Mr Adams
hath told me your ladyship's pleasure, and the reason, which is a very
good one, to prevent burdening us with the poor; we have too many
already, and I think we ought to have an act to hang or transport half
of them. If we can prove in evidence that he is not settled in fact, it
is another matter. What I said to Mr Adams was on a supposition that he
was settled in fact; and indeed, if that was the case, I should
doubt."--"Don't tell me your facts and your ifs," said the lady; "I
don't understand your gibberish; you take too much upon you, and are
very impertinent, in pretending to direct in this parish; and you shall
be taught better, I assure you, you shall. But as to the wench, I am
resolved she shall not settle here; I will not suffer such beauties as
these to produce children for us to keep."--"Beauties, indeed! your
ladyship is pleased to be merry," answered Scout.--"Mr Adams described
her so to me," said the lady. "Pray, what sort of dowdy is it, Mr
Scout?"--"The ugliest creature almost I ever beheld; a poor dirty drab,
your ladyship never saw such a wretch."--"Well, but, dear Mr Scout, let
her be what she will, these ugly women will bring children, you know; so
that we must prevent the marriage."--"True, madam," replied Scout, "for
the subsequent marriage co-operating with the law will carry law into
fact. When a man is married he is settled in fact, and then he is not
removable. I will see Mr Adams, and I make no doubt of prevailing with
him. His only objection is, doubtless, that he shall lose his fee; but
that being once made easy, as it shall be, I am confident no farther
objection will remain. No, no, it is impossible; but your ladyship can't
discommend his unwillingness to depart from his fee. Every man ought to
have a proper value for his fee. As to the matter in question, if your
ladyship pleases to employ me in it, I will venture to promise you
success. The laws of this land are not so vulgar to permit a mean fellow
to contend with one of your ladyship's fortune. We have one sure card,
which is, to carry him before Justice Frolick, who, upon hearing your
ladyship's name, will commit him without any farther questions. As for
the dirty slut, we shall have nothing to do with her; for, if we get rid
of the fellow, the ugly jade will--"--"Take what measures you please,
good Mr Scout," answered the lady: "but I wish you could rid the parish
of both; for Slipslop tells me such stories of this wench, that I abhor
the thoughts of her; and, though you say she is such an ugly slut, yet
you know, dear Mr Scout, these forward creatures, who run after men,
will always find some as forward as themselves; so that, to prevent the
increase of beggars, we must get rid of her."--"Your ladyship is very
much in the right," answered Scout; "but I am afraid the law is a little
deficient in giving us any such power of prevention; however, the
justice will stretch it as far as he is able, to oblige your ladyship.
To say truth, it is a great blessing to the country that he is in the
commission, for he hath taken several poor off our hands that the law
would never lay hold on. I know some justices who think as much of
committing a man to Bridewell as his lordship at 'size would of hanging
him; but it would do a man good to see his worship, our justice, commit
a fellow to Bridewell, he takes so much pleasure in it; and when once we
ha'um there, we seldom hear any more o'um. He's either starved or eat up
by vermin in a month's time."--Here the arrival of a visitor put an end
to the conversation, and Mr Scout, having undertaken the cause and
promised it success, departed.

This Scout was one of those fellows who, without any knowledge of the
law, or being bred to it, take upon them, in defiance of an act of
Parliament, to act as lawyers in the country, and are called so. They
are the pests of society, and a scandal to a profession, to which indeed
they do not belong, and which owes to such kind of rascallions the
ill-will which weak persons bear towards it. With this fellow, to whom a
little before she would not have condescended to have spoken, did a
certain passion for Joseph, and the jealousy and the disdain of poor
innocent Fanny, betray the Lady Booby into a familiar discourse, in
which she inadvertently confirmed many hints with which Slipslop, whose
gallant he was, had pre-acquainted him; and whence he had taken an
opportunity to assert those severe falsehoods of little Fanny which
possibly the reader might not have been well able to account for if we
had not thought proper to give him this information.



CHAPTER IV.

_A short chapter, but very full of matter; particularly the arrival of
Mr Booby and his lady._


All that night, and the next day, the Lady Booby past with the utmost
anxiety; her mind was distracted and her soul tossed up and down by many
turbulent and opposite passions. She loved, hated, pitied, scorned,
admired, despised the same person by fits, which changed in a very short
interval. On Tuesday morning, which happened to be a holiday, she went
to church, where, to her surprize, Mr Adams published the banns again
with as audible a voice as before. It was lucky for her that, as there
was no sermon, she had an immediate opportunity of returning home to
vent her rage, which she could not have concealed from the congregation
five minutes; indeed, it was not then very numerous, the assembly
consisting of no more than Adams, his clerk, his wife, the lady, and one
of her servants. At her return she met Slipslop, who accosted her in
these words:--"O meam, what doth your ladyship think? To be sure, lawyer
Scout hath carried Joseph and Fanny both before the justice. All the
parish are in tears, and say they will certainly be hanged; for nobody
knows what it is for"--"I suppose they deserve it," says the lady.
"What! dost thou mention such wretches to me?"--"O dear madam," answered
Slipslop, "is it not a pity such a graceless young man should die a
virulent death? I hope the judge will take commensuration on his youth.
As for Fanny, I don't think it signifies much what becomes of her; and
if poor Joseph hath done anything, I could venture to swear she traduced
him to it: few men ever come to a fragrant punishment, but by those
nasty creatures, who are a scandal to our sect." The lady was no more
pleased at this news, after a moment's reflection, than Slipslop
herself; for, though she wished Fanny far enough, she did not desire the
removal of Joseph, especially with her. She was puzzled how to act or
what to say on this occasion, when a coach and six drove into the court,
and a servant acquainted her with the arrival of her nephew Booby and
his lady. She ordered them to be conducted into a drawing-room, whither
she presently repaired, having composed her countenance as well as she
could, and being a little satisfied that the wedding would by these
means be at least interrupted, and that she should have an opportunity
to execute any resolution she might take, for which she saw herself
provided with an excellent instrument in Scout.

The Lady Booby apprehended her servant had made a mistake when he
mentioned Mr Booby's lady; for she had never heard of his marriage: but
how great was her surprize when, at her entering the room, her nephew
presented his wife to her; saying, "Madam, this is that charming Pamela,
of whom I am convinced you have heard so much." The lady received her
with more civility than he expected; indeed with the utmost; for she was
perfectly polite, nor had any vice inconsistent with good-breeding. They
past some little time in ordinary discourse, when a servant came and
whispered Mr Booby, who presently told the ladies he must desert them a
little on some business of consequence; and, as their discourse during
his absence would afford little improvement or entertainment to the
reader, we will leave them for a while to attend Mr Booby.



CHAPTER V.

_Containing justice business; curious precedents of depositions, and
other matters necessary to be perused by all justices of the peace and
their clerks._


The young squire and his lady were no sooner alighted from their coach
than the servants began to inquire after Mr Joseph, from whom they said
their lady had not heard a word, to her great surprize, since he had
left Lady Booby's. Upon this they were instantly informed of what had
lately happened, with which they hastily acquainted their master, who
took an immediate resolution to go himself, and endeavour to restore his
Pamela her brother, before she even knew she had lost him.

The justice before whom the criminals were carried, and who lived within
a short mile of the lady's house, was luckily Mr Booby's acquaintance,
by his having an estate in his neighbourhood. Ordering therefore his
horses to his coach, he set out for the judgment-seat, and arrived when
the justice had almost finished his business. He was conducted into a
hall, where he was acquainted that his worship would wait on him in a
moment; for he had only a man and a woman to commit to Bridewell first.
As he was now convinced he had not a minute to lose, he insisted on the
servant's introducing him directly into the room where the justice was
then executing his office, as he called it. Being brought thither, and
the first compliments being passed between the squire and his worship,
the former asked the latter what crime those two young people had been
guilty of? "No great crime," answered the justice; "I have only ordered
them to Bridewell for a month." "But what is their crime?" repeated the
squire. "Larceny, an't please your honour," said Scout. "Ay," says the
justice, "a kind of felonious larcenous thing. I believe I must order
them a little correction too, a little stripping and whipping." (Poor
Fanny, who had hitherto supported all with the thoughts of Joseph's
company, trembled at that sound; but, indeed, without reason, for none
but the devil himself would have executed such a sentence on her.)
"Still," said the squire, "I am ignorant of the crime--the fact I mean."
"Why, there it is in peaper," answered the justice, showing him a
deposition which, in the absence of his clerk, he had writ himself, of
which we have with great difficulty procured an authentic copy; and here
it follows _verbatim et literatim:_--

    _The depusition of James Scout, layer, and Thomas Trotter,
    yeoman, taken before mee, one of his magesty's justasses of the
    piece for Zumersetshire._

    "These deponants saith, and first Thomas Trotter for himself
    saith, that on the -- of this instant October, being
    Sabbath-day, betwin the ours of 2 and 4 in the afternoon, he
    zeed Joseph Andrews and Francis Goodwill walk akross a certane
    felde belunging to layer Scout, and out of the path which ledes
    thru the said felde, and there he zede Joseph Andrews with a
    nife cut one hassel twig, of the value, as he believes, of
    three half-pence, or thereabouts; and he saith that the said
    Francis Goodwill was likewise walking on the grass out of the
    said path in the said felde, and did receive and karry in her
    hand the said twig, and so was cumfarting, eading, and abatting
    to the said Joseph therein. And the said James Scout for
    himself says that he verily believes the said twig to be his
    own proper twig," &c.

"Jesu!" said the squire, "would you commit two persons to Bridewell for
a twig?" "Yes," said the lawyer, "and with great lenity too; for if we
had called it a young tree, they would have been both hanged." "Harkee,"
says the justice, taking aside the squire; "I should not have been so
severe on this occasion, but Lady Booby desires to get them out of the
parish; so lawyer Scout will give the constable orders to let them run
away, if they please: but it seems they intend to marry together, and
the lady hath no other means, as they are legally settled there, to
prevent their bringing an incumbrance on her own parish." "Well," said
the squire, "I will take care my aunt shall be satisfied in this point;
and likewise I promise you, Joseph here shall never be any incumbrance
on her. I shall be obliged to you, therefore, if, instead of Bridewell,
you will commit them to my custody." "O! to be sure, sir, if you desire
it," answered the justice; and without more ado Joseph and Fanny were
delivered over to Squire Booby, whom Joseph very well knew, but little
guessed how nearly he was related to him. The justice burnt his
mittimus, the constable was sent about his business, the lawyer made no
complaint for want of justice; and the prisoners, with exulting hearts,
gave a thousand thanks to his honour Mr Booby; who did not intend their
obligations to him should cease here; for, ordering his man to produce a
cloak-bag, which he had caused to be brought from Lady Booby's on
purpose, he desired the justice that he might have Joseph with him into
a room; where, ordering his servant to take out a suit of his own
clothes, with linnen and other necessaries, he left Joseph to dress
himself, who, not yet knowing the cause of all this civility, excused
his accepting such a favour as long as decently he could. Whilst Joseph
was dressing, the squire repaired to the justice, whom he found talking
with Fanny; for, during the examination, she had flopped her hat over
her eyes, which were also bathed in tears, and had by that means
concealed from his worship what might perhaps have rendered the arrival
of Mr Booby unnecessary, at least for herself. The justice no sooner saw
her countenance cleared up, and her bright eyes shining through her
tears, than he secretly cursed himself for having once thought of
Bridewell for her. He would willingly have sent his own wife thither, to
have had Fanny in her place. And, conceiving almost at the same instant
desires and schemes to accomplish them, he employed the minutes whilst
the squire was absent with Joseph in assuring her how sorry he was for
having treated her so roughly before he knew her merit; and told her,
that since Lady Booby was unwilling that she should settle in her
parish, she was heartily welcome to his, where he promised her his
protection, adding that he would take Joseph and her into his own
family, if she liked it; which assurance he confirmed with a squeeze by
the hand. She thanked him very kindly, and said, "She would acquaint
Joseph with the offer, which he would certainly be glad to accept; for
that Lady Booby was angry with them both; though she did not know either
had done anything to offend her, but imputed it to Madam Slipslop, who
had always been her enemy."

The squire now returned, and prevented any farther continuance of this
conversation; and the justice, out of a pretended respect to his guest,
but in reality from an apprehension of a rival (for he knew nothing of
his marriage), ordered Fanny into the kitchen, whither she gladly
retired; nor did the squire, who declined the trouble of explaining the
whole matter, oppose it.

It would be unnecessary, if I was able, which indeed I am not, to
relate the conversation between these two gentlemen, which rolled, as
I have been informed, entirely on the subject of horse-racing. Joseph
was soon drest in the plainest dress he could find, which was a blue
coat and breeches, with a gold edging, and a red waistcoat with the
same: and as this suit, which was rather too large for the squire,
exactly fitted him, so he became it so well, and looked so genteel,
that no person would have doubted its being as well adapted to his
quality as his shape; nor have suspected, as one might, when my Lord
----, or Sir ----, or Mr ----, appear in lace or embroidery, that the
taylor's man wore those clothes home on his back which he should have
carried under his arm.

The squire now took leave of the justice; and, calling for Fanny, made
her and Joseph, against their wills, get into the coach with him, which
he then ordered to drive to Lady Booby's. It had moved a few yards only,
when the squire asked Joseph if he knew who that man was crossing the
field; for, added he, I never saw one take such strides before. Joseph
answered eagerly, "O, sir, it is parson Adams!" "O la, indeed, and so it
is," said Fanny; "poor man, he is coming to do what he could for us.
Well, he is the worthiest, best-natured creature."--"Ay," said Joseph;
"God bless him! for there is not such another in the universe." "The
best creature living sure," cries Fanny. "Is he?" says the squire; "then
I am resolved to have the best creature living in my coach;" and so
saying, he ordered it to stop, whilst Joseph, at his request, hallowed
to the parson, who, well knowing his voice, made all the haste
imaginable, and soon came up with them. He was desired by the master,
who could scarce refrain from laughter at his figure, to mount into the
coach, which he with many thanks refused, saying he could walk by its
side, and he'd warrant he kept up with it; but he was at length
over-prevailed on. The squire now acquainted Joseph with his marriage;
but he might have spared himself that labour; for his servant, whilst
Joseph was dressing, had performed that office before. He continued to
express the vast happiness he enjoyed in his sister, and the value he
had for all who belonged to her. Joseph made many bows, and exprest as
many acknowledgments: and parson Adams, who now first perceived Joseph's
new apparel, burst into tears with joy, and fell to rubbing his hands
and snapping his fingers as if he had been mad.

They were now arrived at the Lady Booby's, and the squire, desiring them
to wait a moment in the court, walked in to his aunt, and calling her
out from his wife, acquainted her with Joseph's arrival; saying, "Madam,
as I have married a virtuous and worthy woman, I am resolved to own her
relations, and show them all a proper respect; I shall think myself
therefore infinitely obliged to all mine who will do the same. It is
true, her brother hath been your servant, but he is now become my
brother; and I have one happiness, that neither his character, his
behaviour, or appearance, give me any reason to be ashamed of calling
him so. In short, he is now below, dressed like a gentleman, in which
light I intend he shall hereafter be seen; and you will oblige me beyond
expression if you will admit him to be of our party; for I know it will
give great pleasure to my wife, though she will not mention it."

This was a stroke of fortune beyond the Lady Booby's hopes or
expectation; she answered him eagerly, "Nephew, you know how easily I am
prevailed on to do anything which Joseph Andrews desires--Phoo, I mean
which you desire me; and, as he is now your relation, I cannot refuse to
entertain him as such." The squire told her he knew his obligation to
her for her compliance; and going three steps, returned and told her--he
had one more favour, which he believed she would easily grant, as she
had accorded him the former. "There is a young woman--"--"Nephew," says
she, "don't let my good-nature make you desire, as is too commonly the
case, to impose on me. Nor think, because I have with so much
condescension agreed to suffer your brother-in-law to come to my table,
that I will submit to the company of all my own servants, and all the
dirty trollops in the country." "Madam," answered the squire, "I believe
you never saw this young creature. I never beheld such sweetness and
innocence joined with such beauty, and withal so genteel." "Upon my soul
I won't admit her," replied the lady in a passion; "the whole world
shan't prevail on me; I resent even the desire as an affront, and--" The
squire, who knew her inflexibility, interrupted her, by asking pardon,
and promising not to mention it more. He then returned to Joseph, and
she to Pamela. He took Joseph aside, and told him he would carry him to
his sister, but could not prevail as yet for Fanny. Joseph begged that
he might see his sister alone, and then be with his Fanny; but the
squire, knowing the pleasure his wife would have in her brother's
company, would not admit it, telling Joseph there would be nothing in so
short an absence from Fanny, whilst he was assured of her safety;
adding, he hoped he could not so easily quit a sister whom he had not
seen so long, and who so tenderly loved him. Joseph immediately
complied; for indeed no brother could love a sister more; and,
recommending Fanny, who rejoiced that she was not to go before Lady
Booby, to the care of Mr Adams, he attended the squire upstairs, whilst
Fanny repaired with the parson to his house, where she thought herself
secure of a kind reception.



CHAPTER VI.

_Of which you are desired to read no more than you like._


The meeting between Joseph and Pamela was not without tears of joy on
both sides; and their embraces were full of tenderness and affection.
They were, however, regarded with much more pleasure by the nephew than
by the aunt, to whose flame they were fuel only; and this was increased
by the addition of dress, which was indeed not wanted to set off the
lively colours in which Nature had drawn health, strength, comeliness,
and youth. In the afternoon Joseph, at their request, entertained them
with an account of his adventures: nor could Lady Booby conceal her
dissatisfaction at those parts in which Fanny was concerned, especially
when Mr Booby launched forth into such rapturous praises of her beauty.
She said, applying to her niece, that she wondered her nephew, who had
pretended to marry for love, should think such a subject proper to
amuse his wife with; adding, that, for her part, she should be jealous
of a husband who spoke so warmly in praise of another woman. Pamela
answered, indeed, she thought she had cause; but it was an instance of
Mr Booby's aptness to see more beauty in women than they were
mistresses of. At which words both the women fixed their eyes on two
looking-glasses; and Lady Booby replied, that men were, in the general,
very ill judges of beauty; and then, whilst both contemplated only
their own faces, they paid a cross compliment to each other's charms.
When the hour of rest approached, which the lady of the house deferred
as long as decently she could, she informed Joseph (whom for the future
we shall call Mr Joseph, he having as good a title to that appellation
as many others--I mean that incontested one of good clothes) that she
had ordered a bed to be provided for him. He declined this favour to
his utmost; for his heart had long been with his Fanny; but she
insisted on his accepting it, alledging that the parish had no proper
accommodation for such a person as he was now to esteem himself. The
squire and his lady both joining with her, Mr Joseph was at last forced
to give over his design of visiting Fanny that evening; who, on her
side, as impatiently expected him till midnight, when, in complacence
to Mr Adams's family, who had sat up two hours out of respect to her,
she retired to bed, but not to sleep; the thoughts of her love kept her
waking, and his not returning according to his promise filled her with
uneasiness; of which, however, she could not assign any other cause
than merely that of being absent from him.

Mr Joseph rose early in the morning, and visited her in whom his soul
delighted. She no sooner heard his voice in the parson's parlour than
she leapt from her bed, and, dressing herself in a few minutes, went
down to him. They passed two hours with inexpressible happiness
together; and then, having appointed Monday, by Mr Adams's permission,
for their marriage, Mr Joseph returned, according to his promise, to
breakfast at the Lady Booby's, with whose behaviour, since the evening,
we shall now acquaint the reader.

She was no sooner retired to her chamber than she asked Slipslop "What
she thought of this wonderful creature her nephew had married?"--
"Madam?" said Slipslop, not yet sufficiently understanding what answer
she was to make. "I ask you," answered the lady, "what you think of the
dowdy, my niece, I think I am to call her?" Slipslop, wanting no further
hint, began to pull her to pieces, and so miserably defaced her, that it
would have been impossible for any one to have known the person. The
lady gave her all the assistance she could, and ended with saying, "I
think, Slipslop, you have done her justice; but yet, bad as she is, she
is an angel compared to this Fanny." Slipslop then fell on Fanny, whom
she hacked and hewed in the like barbarous manner, concluding with an
observation that there was always something in those low-life creatures
which must eternally extinguish them from their betters. "Really," said
the lady, "I think there is one exception to your rule; I am certain you
may guess who I mean."--"Not I, upon my word, madam," said Slipslop. "I
mean a young fellow; sure you are the dullest wretch," said the lady. "O
la! I am indeed. Yes, truly, madam, he is an accession," answered
Slipslop. "Ay, is he not, Slipslop?" returned the lady. "Is he not so
genteel that a prince might, without a blush, acknowledge him for his
son? His behaviour is such that would not shame the best education. He
borrows from his station a condescension in everything to his superiors,
yet unattended by that mean servility which is called good behaviour in
such persons. Everything he doth hath no mark of the base motive of
fear, but visibly shows some respect and gratitude, and carries with it
the persuasion of love. And then for his virtues: such piety to his
parents, such tender affection to his sister, such integrity in his
friendship, such bravery, such goodness, that, if he had been born a
gentleman, his wife would have possessed the most invaluable
blessing."--"To be sure, ma'am," says Slipslop. "But as he is," answered
the lady, "if he had a thousand more good qualities, it must render a
woman of fashion contemptible even to be suspected of thinking of him;
yes, I should despise myself for such a thought."--"To be sure, ma'am,"
said Slipslop. "And why to be sure?" replied the lady; "thou art always
one's echo. Is he not more worthy of affection than a dirty country
clown, though born of a family as old as the flood? or an idle worthless
rake, or little puisny beau of quality? And yet these we must condemn
ourselves to, in order to avoid the censure of the world; to shun the
contempt of others, we must ally ourselves to those we despise; we must
prefer birth, title, and fortune, to real merit. It is a tyranny of
custom, a tyranny we must comply with; for we people of fashion are the
slaves of custom."--"Marry come up!" said Slipslop, who now knew well
which party to take. "If I was a woman of your ladyship's fortune and
quality, I would be a slave to nobody."--"Me," said the lady; "I am
speaking if a young woman of fashion, who had seen nothing of the world,
should happen to like such a fellow.--Me, indeed! I hope thou dost not
imagine--"--"No, ma'am, to be sure," cries Slipslop. "No! what no?"
cried the lady. "Thou art always ready to answer before thou hast heard
one. So far I must allow he is a charming fellow. Me, indeed! No,
Slipslop, all thoughts of men are over with me. I have lost a husband
who--but if I should reflect I should run mad. My future ease must
depend upon forgetfulness. Slipslop, let me hear some of thy nonsense,
to turn my thoughts another way. What dost thou think of Mr
Andrews?"--"Why, I think," says Slipslop, "he is the handsomest, most
properest man I ever saw; and if I was a lady of the greatest degree it
would be well for some folks. Your ladyship may talk of custom, if you
please: but I am confidous there is no more comparison between young Mr
Andrews and most of the young gentlemen who come to your ladyship's
house in London; a parcel of whipper-snapper sparks: I would sooner
marry our old parson Adams. Never tell me what people say, whilst I am
happy in the arms of him I love. Some folks rail against other folks
because other folks have what some folks would be glad of."--"And so,"
answered the lady, "if you was a woman of condition, you would really
marry Mr Andrews?"--"Yes, I assure your ladyship," replied Slipslop, "if
he would have me."--"Fool, idiot!" cries the lady; "if he would have a
woman of fashion! is that a question?"--"No, truly, madam," said
Slipslop, "I believe it would be none if Fanny was out of the way; and I
am confidous, if I was in your ladyship's place, and liked Mr Joseph
Andrews, she should not stay in the parish a moment. I am sure lawyer
Scout would send her packing if your ladyship would but say the word."
This last speech of Slipslop raised a tempest in the mind of her
mistress. She feared Scout had betrayed her, or rather that she had
betrayed herself. After some silence, and a double change of her
complexion, first to pale and then to red, she thus spoke: "I am
astonished at the liberty you give your tongue. Would you insinuate that
I employed Scout against this wench on account of the fellow?"--"La,
ma'am," said Slipslop, frighted out of her wits, "I assassinate such a
thing!"--"I think you dare not," answered the lady; "I believe my
conduct may defy malice itself to assert so cursed a slander. If I had
ever discovered any wantonness, any lightness in my behaviour; if I had
followed the example of some whom thou hast, I believe, seen, in
allowing myself indecent liberties, even with a husband; but the dear
man who is gone" (here she began to sob), "was he alive again" (then she
produced tears), "could not upbraid me with any one act of tenderness or
passion. No, Slipslop, all the time I cohabited with him he never
obtained even a kiss from me without my expressing reluctance in the
granting it. I am sure he himself never suspected how much I loved him.
Since his death, thou knowest, though it is almost six weeks (it wants
but a day) ago, I have not admitted one visitor till this fool my nephew
arrived. I have confined myself quite to one party of friends. And can
such a conduct as this fear to be arraigned? To be accused, not only of
a passion which I have always despised, but of fixing it on such an
object, a creature so much beneath my notice!"--"Upon my word, ma'am,"
says Slipslop, "I do not understand your ladyship; nor know I anything
of the matter."--"I believe indeed thou dost not understand me. Those
are delicacies which exist only in superior minds; thy coarse ideas
cannot comprehend them. Thou art a low creature, of the Andrews breed, a
reptile of a lower order, a weed that grows in the common garden of the
creation."--"I assure your ladyship," says Slipslop, whose passions were
almost of as high an order as her lady's, "I have no more to do with
Common Garden than other folks. Really, your ladyship talks of servants
as if they were not born of the Christian specious. Servants have flesh
and blood as well as quality; and Mr Andrews himself is a proof that
they have as good, if not better. And for my own part, I can't perceive
my dears[A] are coarser than other people's; and I am sure, if Mr
Andrews was a dear of mine, I should not be ashamed of him in company
with gentlemen; for whoever hath seen him in his new clothes must
confess he looks as much like a gentleman as anybody. Coarse, quotha! I
can't bear to hear the poor young fellow run down neither; for I will
say this, I never heard him say an ill word of anybody in his life. I am
sure his coarseness doth not lie in his heart, for he is the
best-natured man in the world; and as for his skin, it is no coarser
than other people's, I am sure. His bosom, when a boy, was as white as
driven snow; and, where it is not covered with hairs, is so still.
Ifakins! if I was Mrs Andrews, with a hundred a year, I should not envy
the best she who wears a head. A woman that could not be happy with such
a man ought never to be so; for if he can't make a woman happy, I never
yet beheld the man who could. I say again, I wish I was a great lady for
his sake. I believe, when I had made a gentleman of him, he'd behave so
that nobody should deprecate what I had done; and I fancy few would
venture to tell him he was no gentleman to his face, nor to mine
neither." At which words, taking up the candles, she asked her mistress,
who had been some time in her bed, if she had any farther commands? who
mildly answered, she had none; and, telling her she was a comical
creature, bid her good-night.

[A] Meaning perhaps ideas.



CHAPTER VII.

_Philosophical reflections, the like not to be found in any light
French romance. Mr Booby's grave advice to Joseph, and Fanny's
encounter with a beau._


Habit, my good reader, hath so vast a prevalence over the human mind,
that there is scarce anything too strange or too strong to be asserted
of it. The story of the miser, who, from long accustoming to cheat
others, came at last to cheat himself, and with great delight and
triumph picked his own pocket of a guinea to convey to his hoard, is not
impossible or improbable. In like manner it fares with the practisers of
deceit, who, from having long deceived their acquaintance, gain at last
a power of deceiving themselves, and acquire that very opinion (however
false) of their own abilities, excellencies, and virtues, into which
they have for years perhaps endeavoured to betray their neighbours. Now,
reader, to apply this observation to my present purpose, thou must know,
that as the passion generally called love exercises most of the talents
of the female or fair world, so in this they now and then discover a
small inclination to deceit; for which thou wilt not be angry with the
beautiful creatures when thou hast considered that at the age of seven,
or something earlier, miss is instructed by her mother that master is a
very monstrous kind of animal, who will, if she suffers him to come too
near her, infallibly eat her up and grind her to pieces: that, so far
from kissing or toying with him of her own accord, she must not admit
him to kiss or toy with her: and, lastly, that she must never have any
affection towards him; for if she should, all her friends in petticoats
would esteem her a traitress, point at her, and hunt her out of their
society. These impressions, being first received, are farther and deeper
inculcated by their school-mistresses and companions; so that by the age
of ten they have contracted such a dread and abhorrence of the
above-named monster, that whenever they see him they fly from him as the
innocent hare doth from the greyhound. Hence, to the age of fourteen or
fifteen, they entertain a mighty antipathy to master; they resolve, and
frequently profess, that they will never have any commerce with him, and
entertain fond hopes of passing their lives out of his reach, of the
possibility of which they have so visible an example in their good
maiden aunt. But when they arrive at this period, and have now passed
their second climacteric, when their wisdom, grown riper, begins to see
a little farther, and, from almost daily falling in master's way, to
apprehend the great difficulty of keeping out of it; and when they
observe him look often at them, and sometimes very eagerly and earnestly
too (for the monster seldom takes any notice of them till at this age),
they then begin to think of their danger; and, as they perceive they
cannot easily avoid him, the wiser part bethink themselves of providing
by other means for their security. They endeavour, by all methods they
can invent, to render themselves so amiable in his eyes, that he may
have no inclination to hurt them; in which they generally succeed so
well, that his eyes, by frequent languishing, soon lessen their idea of
his fierceness, and so far abate their fears, that they venture to
parley with him; and when they perceive him so different from what he
hath been described, all gentleness, softness, kindness,nd I assure you, your husband is
acting a very foolish part, and opposing his own interest, seeing my
nephew is violently set against this match: and indeed I can't blame
him; it is by no means one suitable to our family." In this manner the
lady proceeded with Mrs Adams, whilst the beau hopped about the room,
shaking his head, partly from pain and partly from anger; and Pamela was
chiding Fanny for her assurance in aiming at such a match as her
brother. Poor Fanny answered only with her tears, which had long since
begun to wet her handkerchief; which Joseph perceiving, took her by the
arm, and wrapping it in his carried her off, swearing he would own no
relation to any one who was an enemy to her he loved more than all the
world. He went out with Fanny under his left arm, brandishing a cudgel
in his right, and neither Mr Booby nor the beau thought proper to oppose
him. Lady Booby and her company made a very short stay behind him; for
the lady's bell now summoned them to dress; for which they had just time
before dinner.

Adams seemed now very much dejected, which his wife perceiving, began to
apply some matrimonial balsam. She told him he had reason to be
concerned, for that he had probably ruined his family with his tricks
almost; but perhaps he was grieved for the loss of his two children,
Joseph and Fanny. His eldest daughter went on: "Indeed, father, it is
very hard to bring strangers here to eat your children's bread out of
their mouths. You have kept them ever since they came home; and, for
anything I see to the contrary, may keep them a month longer; are you
obliged to give her meat, tho'f she was never so handsome? But I don't
see she is so much handsomer than other people. If people were to be
kept for their beauty, she would scarce fare better than her neighbours,
I believe. As for Mr Joseph, I have nothing to say; he is a young man of
honest principles, and will pay some time or other for what he hath; but
for the girl--why doth she not return to her place she ran away from? I
would not give such a vagabond slut a halfpenny though I had a million
of money; no, though she was starving." "Indeed but I would," cries
little Dick; "and, father, rather than poor Fanny shall be starved, I
will give her all this bread and cheese"--(offering what he held in his
hand). Adams smiled on the boy, and told him he rejoiced to see he was a
Christian; and that if he had a halfpenny in his pocket, he would have
given it him; telling him it was his duty to look upon all his
neighbours as his brothers and sisters, and love them accordingly. "Yes,
papa," says he, "I love her better than my sisters, for she is handsomer
than any of them." "Is she so, saucebox?" says the sister, giving him a
box on the ear; which the father would probably have resented, had not
Joseph, Fanny, and the pedlar at that instant returned together. Adams
bid his wife prepare some food for their dinner; she said, "Truly she
could not, she had something else to do." Adams rebuked her for
disputing his commands, and quoted many texts of Scripture to prove
"That the husband is the head of the wife, and she is to submit and
obey." The wife answered, "It was blasphemy to talk Scripture out of
church; that such things were very proper to be said in the pulpit, but
that it was profane to talk them in common discourse." Joseph told Mr
Adams "He was not come with any design to give him or Mrs Adams any
trouble; but to desire the favour of all their company to the George (an
ale-house in the parish), where he had bespoke a piece of bacon and
greens for their dinner." Mrs Adams, who was a very good sort of woman,
only rather too strict in oeconomies, readily accepted this invitation,
as did the parson himself by her example; and away they all walked
together, not omitting little Dick, to whom Joseph gave a shilling when
he heard of his intended liberality to Fanny.



CHAPTER XII.

_Where the good-natured reader will see something which will give him no
great pleasure._


The pedlar had been very inquisitive from the time he had first heard
that the great house in this parish belonged to the Lady Booby, and had
learnt that she was the widow of Sir Thomas, and that Sir Thomas had
bought Fanny, at about the age of three or four years, of a travelling
woman; and, now their homely but hearty meal was ended, he told Fanny
he believed he could acquaint her with her parents. The whole company,
especially she herself, started at this offer of the pedlar's. He then
proceeded thus, while they all lent their strictest attention:--"Though
I am now contented with this humble way of getting my livelihood, I was
formerly a gentleman; for so all those of my profession are called. In
a word, I was a drummer in an Irish regiment of foot. Whilst I was in
this honourable station I attended an officer of our regiment into
England a-recruiting. In our march from Bristol to Froome (for since
the decay of the woollen trade the clothing towns have furnished the
army with a great number of recruits) we overtook on the road a woman,
who seemed to be about thirty years old or thereabouts, not very
handsome, but well enough for a soldier. As we came up to her, she
mended her pace, and falling into discourse with our ladies (for every
man of the party, namely, a serjeant, two private men, and a drum, were
provided with their woman except myself), she continued to travel on
with us. I, perceiving she must fall to my lot, advanced presently to
her, made love to her in our military way, and quickly succeeded to my
wishes. We struck a bargain within a mile, and lived together as man
and wife to her dying day." "I suppose," says Adams, interrupting him,
"you were married with a licence; for I don't see how you could
contrive to have the banns published while you were marching from place
to place." "No, sir," said the pedlar, "we took a licence to go to bed
together without any banns." "Ay! ay!" said the parson; "_ex
necessitate_, a licence may be allowable enough; but surely, surely,
the other is the more regular and eligible way." The pedlar proceeded
thus: "She returned with me to our regiment, and removed with us from
quarters to quarters, till at last, whilst we lay at Galloway, she fell
ill of a fever and died. When she was on her death-bed she called me to
her, and, crying bitterly, declared she could not depart this world
without discovering a secret to me, which, she said, was the only sin
which sat heavy on her heart. She said she had formerly travelled in a
company of gypsies, who had made a practice of stealing away children;
that for her own part, she had been only once guilty of the crime;
which, she said, she lamented more than all the rest of her sins, since
probably it might have occasioned the death of the parents; for, added
she, it is almost impossible to describe the beauty of the young
creature, which was about a year and a half old when I kidnapped it. We
kept her (for she was a girl) above two years in our company, when I
sold her myself, for three guineas, to Sir Thomas Booby, in
Somersetshire. Now, you know whether there are any more of that name in
this county." "Yes," says Adams, "there are several Boobys who are
squires, but I believe no baronet now alive; besides, it answers so
exactly in every point, there is no room for doubt; but you have forgot
to tell us the parents from whom the child was stolen." "Their name,"
answered the pedlar, "was Andrews. They lived about thirty miles from
the squire; and she told me that I might be sure to find them out by
one circumstance; for that they had a daughter of a very strange name,
Pamela, or Pam_e_la; some pronounced it one way, and some the other."
Fanny, who had changed colour at the first mention of the name, now
fainted away; Joseph turned pale, and poor Dicky began to roar; the
parson fell on his knees, and ejaculated many thanksgivings that this
discovery had been made before the dreadful sin of incest was
committed; and the pedlar was struck with amazement, not being able to
account for all this confusion; the cause of which was presently opened
by the parson's daughter, who was the only unconcerned person (for the
mother was chafing Fanny's temples, and taking the utmost care of her):
and, indeed, Fanny was the only creature whom the daughter would not
have pitied in her situation; wherein, though we compassionate her
ourselves, we shall leave her for a little while, and pay a short visit
to Lady Booby.



CHAPTER XIII.

_The history, returning to the Lady Booby, gives some account of the
terrible conflict in her breast between love and pride; with what
happened on the present discovery._


The lady sat down with her company to dinner, but eat nothing. As soon
as her cloth was removed she whispered Pamela that she was taken a
little ill, and desired her to entertain her husband and beau Didapper.
She then went up into her chamber, sent for Slipslop, threw herself on
the bed in the agonies of love, rage, and despair; nor could she conceal
these boiling passions longer without bursting. Slipslop now approached
her bed, and asked how her ladyship did; but, instead of revealing her
disorder, as she intended, she entered into a long encomium on the
beauty and virtues of Joseph Andrews; ending, at last, with expressing
her concern that so much tenderness should be thrown away on so
despicable an object as Fanny. Slipslop, well knowing how to humour her
mistress's frenzy, proceeded to repeat, with exaggeration, if possible,
all her mistress had said, and concluded with a wish that Joseph had
been a gentleman, and that she could see her lady in the arms of such a
husband. The lady then started from the bed, and, taking a turn or two
across the room, cryed out, with a deep sigh, "Sure he would make any
woman happy!"--"Your ladyship," says she, "would be the happiest woman
in the world with him. A fig for custom and nonsense! What 'vails what
people say? Shall I be afraid of eating sweetmeats because people may
say I have a sweet tooth? If I had a mind to marry a man, all the world
should not hinder me. Your ladyship hath no parents to tutelar your
infections; besides, he is of your ladyship's family now, and as good a
gentleman as any in the country; and why should not a woman follow her
mind as well as man? Why should not your ladyship marry the brother as
well as your nephew the sister. I am sure, if it was a fragrant crime, I
would not persuade your ladyship to it."--"But, dear Slipslop," answered
the lady, "if I could prevail on myself to commit such a weakness, there
is that cursed Fanny in the way, whom the idiot--O how I hate and
despise him!"--"She! a little ugly mynx," cries Slipslop; "leave her to
me. I suppose your ladyship hath heard of Joseph's fitting with one of
Mr Didapper's servants about her; and his master hath ordered them to
carry her away by force this evening. I'll take care they shall not want
assistance. I was talking with this gentleman, who was below, just when
your ladyship sent for me."--"Go back," says the Lady Booby, "this
instant, for I expect Mr Didapper will soon be going. Do all you can;
for I am resolved this wench shall not be in our family: I will
endeavour to return to the company; but let me know as soon as she is
carried off." Slipslop went away; and her mistress began to arraign her
own conduct in the following manner:--

"What am I doing? How do I suffer this passion to creep imperceptibly
upon me? How many days are past since I could have submitted to ask
myself the question?--Marry a footman! Distraction! Can I afterwards
bear the eyes of my acquaintance? But I can retire from them; retire
with one in whom I propose more happiness than the world without him
can give me! Retire-to feed continually on beauties which my inflamed
imagination sickens with eagerly gazing on; to satisfy every appetite,
every desire, with their utmost wish. Ha! and do I doat thus on a
footman? I despise, I detest my passion.--Yet why? Is he not generous,
gentle, kind?--Kind! to whom? to the meanest wretch, a creature below my
consideration. Doth he not--yes, he doth prefer her. Curse his beauties,
and the little low heart that possesses them; which can basely descend
to this despicable wench, and be ungratefully deaf to all the honours I
do him. And can I then love this monster? No, I will tear his image from
my bosom, tread on him, spurn him. I will have those pitiful charms,
which now I despise, mangled in my sight; for I will not suffer the
little jade I hate to riot in the beauties I contemn. No; though I
despise him myself, though I would spurn him from my feet, was he to
languish at them, no other should taste the happiness I scorn. Why do I
say happiness? To me it would be misery. To sacrifice my reputation, my
character, my rank in life, to the indulgence of a mean and a vile
appetite! How I detest the thought! How much more exquisite is the
pleasure resulting from the reflection of virtue and prudence than the
faint relish of what flows from vice and folly! Whither did I suffer
this improper, this mad passion to hurry me, only by neglecting to
summon the aids of reason to my assistance? Reason, which hath now set
before me my desires in their proper colours, and immediately helped me
to expel them. Yes, I thank Heaven and my pride, I have now perfectly
conquered this unworthy passion; and if there was no obstacle in its
way, my pride would disdain any pleasures which could be the consequence
of so base, so mean, so vulgar--" Slipslop returned at this instant in a
violent hurry, and with the utmost eagerness cryed out, "O madam! I have
strange news. Tom the footman is just come from the George; where, it
seems, Joseph and the rest of them are a jinketting; and he says there
is a strange man who hath discovered that Fanny and Joseph are brother
and sister."--"How, Slipslop?" cries the lady, in a surprize.--"I had
not time, madam," cries Slipslop, "to enquire about particles, but Tom
says it is most certainly true."

This unexpected account entirely obliterated all those admirable
reflections which the supreme power of reason had so wisely made just
before. In short, when despair, which had more share in producing the
resolutions of hatred we have seen taken, began to retreat, the lady
hesitated a moment, and then, forgetting all the purport of her
soliloquy, dismissed her woman again, with orders to bid Tom attend her
in the parlour, whither she now hastened to acquaint Pamela with the
news. Pamela said she could not believe it; for she had never heard that
her mother had lost any child, or that she had ever had any more than
Joseph and herself. The lady flew into a violent rage with her, and
talked of upstarts and disowning relations who had so lately been on a
level with her. Pamela made no answer; but her husband, taking up her
cause, severely reprimanded his aunt for her behaviour to his wife: he
told her, if it had been earlier in the evening she should not have
staid a moment longer in her house; that he was convinced, if this young
woman could be proved her sister, she would readily embrace her as such,
and he himself would do the same. He then desired the fellow might be
sent for, and the young woman with him, which Lady Booby immediately
ordered; and, thinking proper to make some apology to Pamela for what
she had said, it was readily accepted, and all things reconciled.

The pedlar now attended, as did Fanny and Joseph, who would not quit
her; the parson likewise was induced, not only by curiosity, of which he
had no small portion, but his duty, as he apprehended it, to follow
them; for he continued all the way to exhort them, who were now breaking
their hearts, to offer up thanksgivings, and be joyful for so miraculous
an escape.

When they arrived at Booby-Hall they were presently called into the
parlour, where the pedlar repeated the same story he had told before,
and insisted on the truth of every circumstance; so that all who heard
him were extremely well satisfied of the truth, except Pamela, who
imagined, as she had never heard either of her parents mention such an
accident, that it must be certainly false; and except the Lady Booby,
who suspected the falsehood of the story from her ardent desire that it
should be true; and Joseph, who feared its truth, from his earnest
wishes that it might prove false.

Mr Booby now desired them all to suspend their curiosity and absolute
belief or disbelief till the next morning, when he expected old Mr
Andrews and his wife to fetch himself and Pamela home in his coach, and
then they might be certain of certainly knowing the truth or falsehood
of this relation; in which, he said, as there were many strong
circumstances to induce their credit, so he could not perceive any
interest the pedlar could have in inventing it, or in endeavouring to
impose such a falsehood on them.

The Lady Booby, who was very little used to such company, entertained
them all--_viz_. her nephew, his wife, her brother and sister, the beau,
and the parson, with great good humour at her own table. As to the
pedlar, she ordered him to be made as welcome as possible by her
servants. All the company in the parlour, except the disappointed
lovers, who sat sullen and silent, were full of mirth; for Mr Booby had
prevailed on Joseph to ask Mr Didapper's pardon, with which he was
perfectly satisfied. Many jokes passed between the beau and the parson,
chiefly on each other's dress; these afforded much diversion to the
company. Pamela chid her brother Joseph for the concern which he exprest
at discovering a new sister. She said, if he loved Fanny as he ought,
with a pure affection, he had no reason to lament being related to
her.--Upon which Adams began to discourse on Platonic love; whence he
made a quick transition to the joys in the next world, and concluded
with strongly asserting that there was no such thing as pleasure in
this. At which Pamela and her husband smiled on one another.

This happy pair proposing to retire (for no other person gave the least
symptom of desiring rest), they all repaired to several beds provided
for them in the same house; nor was Adams himself suffered to go home,
it being a stormy night. Fanny indeed often begged she might go home
with the parson; but her stay was so strongly insisted on, that she at
last, by Joseph's advice, consented.



CHAPTER XIV.

_Containing several curious night-adventures, in which Mr Adams fell
into many hair-breadth 'scapes, partly owing to his goodness, and partly
to his inadvertency._


About an hour after they had all separated (it being now past three in
the morning), beau Didapper, whose passion for Fanny permitted him not
to close his eyes, but had employed his imagination in contrivances how
to satisfy his desires, at last hit on a method by which he hoped to
effect it. He had ordered his servant to bring him word where Fanny lay,
and had received his information; he therefore arose, put on his
breeches and nightgown, and stole softly along the gallery which led to
her apartment; and, being come to the door, as he imagined it, he opened
it with the least noise possible and entered the chamber. A savour now
invaded his nostrils which he did not expect in the room of so sweet a
young creature, and which might have probably had no good effect on a
cooler lover. However, he groped out the bed with difficulty, for there
was not a glimpse of light, and, opening the curtains, he whispered in
Joseph's voice (for he was an excellent mimic), "Fanny, my angel! I am
come to inform thee that I have discovered the falsehood of the story we
last night heard. I am no longer thy brother, but the lover; nor will I
be delayed the enjoyment of thee one moment longer. You have sufficient
assurances of my constancy not to doubt my marrying you, and it would be
want of love to deny me the possession of thy charms."--So saying, he
disencumbered himself from the little clothes he had on, and, leaping
into bed, embraced his angel, as he conceived her, with great rapture.
If he was surprized at receiving no answer, he was no less pleased to
find his hug returned with equal ardour. He remained not long in this
sweet confusion; for both he and his paramour presently discovered their
error. Indeed it was no other than the accomplished Slipslop whom he had
engaged; but, though she immediately knew the person whom she had
mistaken for Joseph, he was at a loss to guess at the representative of
Fanny. He had so little seen or taken notice of this gentlewoman, that
light itself would have afforded him no assistance in his conjecture.
Beau Didapper no sooner had perceived his mistake than he attempted to
escape from the bed with much greater haste than he had made to it; but
the watchful Slipslop prevented him. For that prudent woman, being
disappointed of those delicious offerings which her fancy had promised
her pleasure, resolved to make an immediate sacrifice to her virtue.
Indeed she wanted an opportunity to heal some wounds, which her late
conduct had, she feared, given her reputation; and, as she had a
wonderful presence of mind, she conceived the person of the unfortunate
beau to be luckily thrown in her way to restore her lady's opinion of
her impregnable chastity. At that instant, therefore, when he offered to
leap from the bed, she caught fast hold of his shirt, at the same time
roaring out, "O thou villain! who hast attacked my chastity, and, I
believe, ruined me in my sleep; I will swear a rape against thee, I will
prosecute thee with the utmost vengeance." The beau attempted to get
loose, but she held him fast, and when he struggled she cried out
"Murder! murder! rape! robbery! ruin!" At which words, parson Adams, who
lay in the next chamber, wakeful, and meditating on the pedlar's
discovery, jumped out of bed, and, without staying to put a rag of
clothes on, hastened into the apartment whence the cries proceeded. He
made directly to the bed in the dark, where, laying hold of the beau's
skin (for Slipslop had torn his shirt almost off), and finding his skin
extremely soft, and hearing him in a low voice begging Slipslop to let
him go, he no longer doubted but this was the young woman in danger of
ravishing, and immediately falling on the bed, and laying hold on
Slipslop's chin, where he found a rough beard, his belief was confirmed;
he therefore rescued the beau, who presently made his escape, and then,
turning towards Slipslop, received such a cuff on his chops, that, his
wrath kindling instantly, he offered to return the favour so stoutly,
that had poor Slipslop received the fist, which in the dark passed by
her and fell on the pillow, she would most probably have given up the
ghost. Adams, missing his blow, fell directly on Slipslop, who cuffed
and scratched as well as she could; nor was he behindhand with her in
his endeavours, but happily the darkness of the night befriended her.
She then cried she was a woman; but Adams answered, she was rather the
devil, and if she was he would grapple with him; and, being again
irritated by another stroke on his chops, he gave her such a remembrance
in the guts, that she began to roar loud enough to be heard all over the
house. Adams then, seizing her by the hair (for her double-clout had
fallen off in the scuffle), pinned her head down to the bolster, and
then both called for lights together. The Lady Booby, who was as wakeful
as any of her guests, had been alarmed from the beginning; and, being a
woman of a bold spirit, she slipt on a nightgown, petticoat, and
slippers, and taking a candle, which always burnt in her chamber, in her
hand, she walked undauntedly to Slipslop's room; where she entered just
at the instant as Adams had discovered, by the two mountains which
Slipslop carried before her, that he was concerned with a female. He
then concluded her to be a witch, and said he fancied those breasts gave
suck to a legion of devils. Slipslop, seeing Lady Booby enter the room,
cried help! or I am ravished, with a most audible voice: and Adams,
perceiving the light, turned hastily, and saw the lady (as she did him)
just as she came to the feet of the bed; nor did her modesty, when she
found the naked condition of Adams, suffer her to approach farther. She
then began to revile the parson as the wickedest of all men, and
particularly railed at his impudence in chusing her house for the scene
of his debaucheries, and her own woman for the object of his bestiality.
Poor Adams had before discovered the countenance of his bedfellow, and,
now first recollecting he was naked, he was no less confounded than Lady
Booby herself, and immediately whipt under the bedclothes, whence the
chaste Slipslop endeavoured in vain to shut him out. Then putting forth
his head, on which, by way of ornament, he wore a flannel nightcap, he
protested his innocence, and asked ten thousand pardons of Mrs Slipslop
for the blows he had struck her, vowing he had mistaken her for a witch.
Lady Booby, then casting her eyes on the ground, observed something
sparkle with great lustre, which, when she had taken it up, appeared to
be a very fine pair of diamond buttons for the sleeves. A little farther
she saw lie the sleeve itself of a shirt with laced ruffles. "Heyday!"
says she, "what is the meaning of this?" "O, madam," says Slipslop, "I
don't know what hath happened, I have been so terrified. Here may have
been a dozen men in the room." "To whom belongs this laced shirt and
jewels?" says the lady. "Undoubtedly," cries the parson, "to the young
gentleman whom I mistook for a woman on coming into the room, whence
proceeded all the subsequent mistakes; for if I had suspected him for a
man, I would have seized him, had he been another Hercules, though,
indeed, he seems rather to resemble Hylas." He then gave an account of
the reason of his rising from bed, and the rest, till the lady came into
the room; at which, and the figures of Slipslop and her gallant, whose
heads only were visible at the opposite corners of the bed, she could
not refrain from laughter; nor did Slipslop persist in accusing the
parson of any motions towards a rape. The lady therefore desired him to
return to his bed as soon as she was departed, and then ordering
Slipslop to rise and attend her in her own room, she returned herself
thither. When she was gone, Adams renewed his petitions for pardon to
Mrs Slipslop, who, with a most Christian temper, not only forgave, but
began to move with much courtesy towards him, which he taking as a hint
to begin, immediately quitted the bed, and made the best of his way
towards his own; but unluckily, instead of turning to the right, he
turned to the left, and went to the apartment where Fanny lay, who (as
the reader may remember) had not slept a wink the preceding night, and
who was so hagged out with what had happened to her in the day, that,
notwithstanding all thoughts of her Joseph, she was fallen into so
profound a sleep, that all the noise in the adjoining room had not been
able to disturb her. Adams groped out the bed, and, turning the clothes
down softly, a custom Mrs Adams had long accustomed him to, crept in,
and deposited his carcase on the bed-post, a place which that good woman
had always assigned him.

As the cat or lap-dog of some lovely nymph, for whom ten thousand lovers
languish, lies quietly by the side of the charming maid, and, ignorant
of the scene of delight on which they repose, meditates the future
capture of a mouse, or surprisal of a plate of bread and butter: so
Adams lay by the side of Fanny, ignorant of the paradise to which he was
so near; nor could the emanation of sweets which flowed from her breath
overpower the fumes of tobacco which played in the parson's nostrils.
And now sleep had not overtaken the good man, when Joseph, who had
secretly appointed Fanny to come to her at the break of day, rapped
softly at the chamber-door, which when he had repeated twice, Adams
cryed, "Come in, whoever you are." Joseph thought he had mistaken the
door, though she had given him the most exact directions; however,
knowing his friend's voice, he opened it, and saw some female vestments
lying on a chair. Fanny waking at the same instant, and stretching out
her hand on Adams's beard, she cried out,--"O heavens! where am I?"
"Bless me! where am I?" said the parson. Then Fanny screamed, Adams
leapt out of bed, and Joseph stood, as the tragedians call it, like the
statue of Surprize. "How came she into my room?" cryed Adams. "How came
you into hers?" cryed Joseph, in an astonishment. "I know nothing of the
matter," answered Adams, "but that she is a vestal for me. As I am a
Christian, I know not whether she is a man or woman. He is an infidel
who doth not believe in witchcraft. They as surely exist now as in the
days of Saul. My clothes are bewitched away too, and Fanny's brought
into their place." For he still insisted he was in his own apartment;
but Fanny denied it vehemently, and said his attempting to persuade
Joseph of such a falsehood convinced her of his wicked designs. "How!"
said Joseph in a rage, "hath he offered any rudeness to you?" She
answered--She could not accuse him of any more than villanously stealing
to bed to her, which she thought rudeness sufficient, and what no man
would do without a wicked intention.

Joseph's great opinion of Adams was not easily to be staggered, and when
he heard from Fanny that no harm had happened he grew a little cooler;
yet still he was confounded, and, as he knew the house, and that the
women's apartments were on this side Mrs Slipslop's room, and the men's
on the other, he was convinced that he was in Fanny's chamber. Assuring
Adams therefore of this truth, he begged him to give some account how he
came there. Adams then, standing in his shirt, which did not offend
Fanny, as the curtains of the bed were drawn, related all that had
happened; and when he had ended Joseph told him,--It was plain he had
mistaken by turning to the right instead of the left. "Odso!" cries
Adams, "that's true: as sure as sixpence, you have hit on the very
thing." He then traversed the room, rubbing his hands, and begged
Fanny's pardon, assuring her he did not know whether she was man or
woman. That innocent creature firmly believing all he said, told him she
was no longer angry, and begged Joseph to conduct him into his own
apartment, where he should stay himself till she had put her clothes on.
Joseph and Adams accordingly departed, and the latter soon was convinced
of the mistake he had committed; however, whilst he was dressing
himself, he often asserted he believed in the power of witchcraft
notwithstanding, and did not see how a Christian could deny it.



CHAPTER XV.

_The arrival of Gaffar and Gammar Andrews, with another person not
much expected; and a perfect solution of the difficulties raised by
the pedlar._


As soon as Fanny was drest Joseph returned to her, and they had a long
conversation together, the conclusion of which was, that, if they found
themselves to be really brother and sister, they vowed a perpetual
celibacy, and to live together all their days, and indulge a Platonic
friendship for each other.

The company were all very merry at breakfast, and Joseph and Fanny
rather more chearful than the preceding night. The Lady Booby produced
the diamond button, which the beau most readily owned, and alledged that
he was very subject to walk in his sleep. Indeed, he was far from being
ashamed of his amour, and rather endeavoured to insinuate that more than
was really true had passed between him and the fair Slipslop.

Their tea was scarce over when news came of the arrival of old Mr
Andrews and his wife. They were immediately introduced, and kindly
received by the Lady Booby, whose heart went now pit-a-pat, as did those
of Joseph and Fanny. They felt, perhaps, little less anxiety in this
interval than Oedipus himself, whilst his fate was revealing.

Mr Booby first opened the cause by informing the old gentleman that he
had a child in the company more than he knew of, and, taking Fanny by
the hand, told him, this was that daughter of his who had been stolen
away by gypsies in her infancy. Mr Andrews, after expressing some
astonishment, assured his honour that he had never lost a daughter by
gypsies, nor ever had any other children than Joseph and Pamela. These
words were a cordial to the two lovers; but had a different effect on
Lady Booby. She ordered the pedlar to be called, who recounted his story
as he had done before.--At the end of which, old Mrs Andrews, running to
Fanny, embraced her, crying out, "She is, she is my child!" The company
were all amazed at this disagreement between the man and his wife; and
the blood had now forsaken the cheeks of the lovers, when the old woman,
turning to her husband, who was more surprized than all the rest, and
having a little recovered her own spirits, delivered herself as follows:
"You may remember, my dear, when you went a serjeant to Gibraltar, you
left me big with child; you stayed abroad, you know, upwards of three
years. In your absence I was brought to bed, I verily believe, of this
daughter, whom I am sure I have reason to remember, for I suckled her at
this very breast till the day she was stolen from me. One afternoon,
when the child was about a year, or a year and a half old, or
thereabouts, two gypsy-women came to the door and offered to tell my
fortune. One of them had a child in her lap. I showed them my hand, and
desired to know if you was ever to come home again, which I remember as
well as if it was but yesterday: they faithfully promised me you
should.--I left the girl in the cradle and went to draw them a cup of
liquor, the best I had: when I returned with the pot (I am sure I was
not absent longer than whilst I am telling it to you) the women were
gone. I was afraid they had stolen something, and looked and looked, but
to no purpose, and, Heaven knows, I had very little for them to steal.
At last, hearing the child cry in the cradle, I went to take it up--but,
O the living! how was I surprized to find, instead of my own girl that I
had put into the cradle, who was as fine a fat thriving child as you
shall see in a summer's day, a poor sickly boy, that did not seem to
have an hour to live. I ran out, pulling my hair off and crying like any
mad after the women, but never could hear a word of them from that day
to this. When I came back the poor infant (which is our Joseph there, as
stout as he now stands) lifted up its eyes upon me so piteously, that,
to be sure, notwithstanding my passion, I could not find in my heart to
do it any mischief. A neighbour of mine, happening to come in at the
same time, and hearing the case, advised me to take care of this poor
child, and God would perhaps one day restore me my own. Upon which I
took the child up, and suckled it to be sure, all the world as if it had
been born of my own natural body; and as true as I am alive, in a little
time I loved the boy all to nothing as if it had been my own
girl.--Well, as I was saying, times growing very hard, I having two
children and nothing but my own work, which was little enough, God
knows, to maintain them, was obliged to ask relief of the parish; but,
instead of giving it me, they removed me, by justices' warrants, fifteen
miles, to the place where I now live, where I had not been long settled
before you came home. Joseph (for that was the name I gave him
myself--the Lord knows whether he was baptized or no, or by what name),
Joseph, I say, seemed to me about five years old when you returned; for
I believe he is two or three years older than our daughter here (for I
am thoroughly convinced she is the same); and when you saw him you said
he was a chopping boy, without ever minding his age; and so I, seeing
you did not suspect anything of the matter, thought I might e'en as well
keep it to myself, for fear you should not love him as well as I did.
And all this is veritably true, and I will take my oath of it before any
justice in the kingdom."

The pedlar, who had been summoned by the order of Lady Booby, listened
with the utmost attention to Gammar Andrews's story; and, when she had
finished, asked her if the supposititious child had no mark on its
breast? To which she answered, "Yes, he had as fine a strawberry as ever
grew in a garden." This Joseph acknowledged, and, unbuttoning his coat,
at the intercession of the company, showed to them. "Well," says Gaffar
Andrews, who was a comical sly old fellow, and very likely desired to
have no more children than he could keep, "you have proved, I think,
very plainly, that this boy doth not belong to us; but how are you
certain that the girl is ours?" The parson then brought the pedlar
forward, and desired him to repeat the story which he had communicated
to him the preceding day at the ale-house; which he complied with, and
related what the reader, as well as Mr Adams, hath seen before. He then
confirmed, from his wife's report, all the circumstances of the
exchange, and of the strawberry on Joseph's breast. At the repetition of
the word strawberry, Adams, who had seen it without any emotion, started
and cried, "Bless me! something comes into my head." But before he had
time to bring anything out a servant called him forth. When he was gone
the pedlar assured Joseph that his parents were persons of much greater
circumstances than those he had hitherto mistaken for such; for that he
had been stolen from a gentleman's house by those whom they call
gypsies, and had been kept by them during a whole year, when, looking on
him as in a dying condition, they had exchanged him for the other
healthier child, in the manner before related. He said, As to the name
of his father, his wife had either never known or forgot it; but that
she had acquainted him he lived about forty miles from the place where
the exchange had been made, and which way, promising to spare no pains
in endeavouring with him to discover the place.

But Fortune, which seldom doth good or ill, or makes men happy or
miserable, by halves, resolved to spare him this labour. The reader may
please to recollect that Mr Wilson had intended a journey to the west,
in which he was to pass through Mr Adams's parish, and had promised to
call on him. He was now arrived at the Lady Booby's gates for that
purpose, being directed thither from the parson's house, and had sent in
the servant whom we have above seen call Mr Adams forth. This had no
sooner mentioned the discovery of a stolen child, and had uttered the
word strawberry, than Mr Wilson, with wildness in his looks, and the
utmost eagerness in his words, begged to be shewed into the room, where
he entered without the least regard to any of the company but Joseph,
and, embracing him with a complexion all pale and trembling, desired to
see the mark on his breast; the parson followed him capering, rubbing
his hands, and crying out, _Hic est quem quaeris; inventus est, &c_.
Joseph complied with the request of Mr Wilson, who no sooner saw the
mark than, abandoning himself to the most extravagant rapture of
passion, he embraced Joseph with inexpressible ecstasy, and cried out in
tears of joy, "I have discovered my son, I have him again in my arms!"
Joseph was not sufficiently apprized yet to taste the same delight with
his father (for so in reality he was); however, he returned some warmth
to his embraces: but he no sooner perceived, from his father's account,
the agreement of every circumstance, of person, time, and place, than he
threw himself at his feet, and, embracing his knees, with tears begged
his blessing, which was given with much affection, and received with
such respect, mixed with such tenderness on both sides, that it affected
all present; but none so much as Lady Booby, who left the room in an
agony, which was but too much perceived, and not very charitably
accounted for by some of the company.



CHAPTER XVI.

_Being the last in which this true history is brought to a happy
conclusion._


Fanny was very little behind her Joseph in the duty she exprest towards
her parents, and the joy she evidenced in discovering them. Gammar
Andrews kissed her, and said, She was heartily glad to see her; but for
her part, she could never love any one better than Joseph. Gaffar
Andrews testified no remarkable emotion: he blessed and kissed her, but
complained bitterly that he wanted his pipe, not having had a whiff
that morning.

Mr Booby, who knew nothing of his aunt's fondness, imputed her abrupt
departure to her pride, and disdain of the family into which he was
married; he was therefore desirous to be gone with the utmost celerity;
and now, having congratulated Mr Wilson and Joseph on the discovery, he
saluted Fanny, called her sister, and introduced her as such to Pamela,
who behaved with great decency on the occasion.

He now sent a message to his aunt, who returned that she wished him a
good journey, but was too disordered to see any company: he therefore
prepared to set out, having invited Mr Wilson to his house; and Pamela
and Joseph both so insisted on his complying, that he at last
consented, having first obtained a messenger from Mr Booby to acquaint
his wife with the news; which, as he knew it would render her
completely happy, he could not prevail on himself to delay a moment in
acquainting her with.

The company were ranged in this manner: the two old people, with their
two daughters, rode in the coach; the squire, Mr Wilson, Joseph, parson
Adams, and the pedlar, proceeded on horseback.

In their way, Joseph informed his father of his intended match with
Fanny; to which, though he expressed some reluctance at first, on the
eagerness of his son's instances he consented; saying, if she was so
good a creature as she appeared, and he described her, he thought the
disadvantages of birth and fortune might be compensated. He however
insisted on the match being deferred till he had seen his mother; in
which, Joseph perceiving him positive, with great duty obeyed him, to
the great delight of parson Adams, who by these means saw an
opportunity of fulfilling the Church forms, and marrying his
parishioners without a licence.

Mr Adams, greatly exulting on this occasion (for such ceremonies were
matters of no small moment with him), accidentally gave spurs to his
horse, which the generous beast disdaining--for he was of high mettle,
and had been used to more expert riders than the gentleman who at
present bestrode him, for whose horsemanship he had perhaps some
contempt--immediately ran away full speed, and played so many antic
tricks that he tumbled the parson from his back; which Joseph
perceiving, came to his relief.

This accident afforded infinite merriment to the servants, and no less
frighted poor Fanny, who beheld him as he passed by the coach; but the
mirth of the one and terror of the other were soon determined, when the
parson declared he had received no damage.

The horse having freed himself from his unworthy rider, as he probably
thought him, proceeded to make the best of his way; but was stopped by a
gentleman and his servants, who were travelling the opposite way, and
were now at a little distance from the coach. They soon met; and as one
of the servants delivered Adams his horse, his master hailed him, and
Adams, looking up, presently recollected he was the justice of peace
before whom he and Fanny had made their appearance. The parson presently
saluted him very kindly; and the justice informed him that he had found
the fellow who attempted to swear against him and the young woman the
very next day, and had committed him to Salisbury gaol, where he was
charged with many robberies.

Many compliments having passed between the parson and the justice, the
latter proceeded on his journey; and the former, having with some
disdain refused Joseph's offer of changing horses, and declared he was
as able a horseman as any in the kingdom, remounted his beast; and now
the company again proceeded, and happily arrived at their journey's
end, Mr Adams, by good luck, rather than by good riding, escaping a
second fall.

The company, arriving at Mr Booby's house, were all received by him in
the most courteous and entertained in the most splendid manner, after
the custom of the old English hospitality, which is still preserved in
some very few families in the remote parts of England. They all passed
that day with the utmost satisfaction; it being perhaps impossible to
find any set of people more solidly and sincerely happy. Joseph and
Fanny found means to be alone upwards of two hours, which were the
shortest but the sweetest imaginable.

In the morning Mr Wilson proposed to his son to make a visit with him to
his mother; which, notwithstanding his dutiful inclinations, and a
longing desire he had to see her, a little concerned him, as he must be
obliged to leave his Fanny; but the goodness of Mr Booby relieved him;
for he proposed to send his own coach and six for Mrs Wilson, whom
Pamela so very earnestly invited, that Mr Wilson at length agreed with
the entreaties of Mr Booby and Joseph, and suffered the coach to go
empty for his wife.

On Saturday night the coach returned with Mrs Wilson, who added one more
to this happy assembly. The reader may imagine much better and quicker
too than I can describe the many embraces and tears of joy which
succeeded her arrival. It is sufficient to say she was easily prevailed
with to follow her husband's example in consenting to the match.

On Sunday Mr Adams performed the service at the squire's parish church,
the curate of which very kindly exchanged duty, and rode twenty miles to
the Lady Booby's parish so to do; being particularly charged not to omit
publishing the banns, being the third and last time.

At length the happy day arrived which was to put Joseph in the
possession of all his wishes. He arose, and drest himself in a neat but
plain suit of Mr Booby's, which exactly fitted him; for he refused all
finery; as did Fanny likewise, who could be prevailed on by Pamela to
attire herself in nothing richer than a white dimity nightgown. Her
shift indeed, which Pamela presented her, was of the finest kind, and
had an edging of lace round the bosom. She likewise equipped her with a
pair of fine white thread stockings, which were all she would accept;
for she wore one of her own short round-eared caps, and over it a
little straw hat, lined with cherry-coloured silk, and tied with a
cherry-coloured ribbon. In this dress she came forth from her chamber,
blushing and breathing sweets; and was by Joseph, whose eyes sparkled
fire, led to church, the whole family attending, where Mr Adams
performed the ceremony; at which nothing was so remarkable as the
extraordinary and unaffected modesty of Fanny, unless the true
Christian piety of Adams, who publickly rebuked Mr Booby and Pamela for
laughing in so sacred a place, and on so solemn an occasion. Our parson
would have done no less to the highest prince on earth; for, though he
paid all submission and deference to his superiors in other matters,
where the least spice of religion intervened he immediately lost all
respect of persons. It was his maxim, that he was a servant of the
Highest, and could not, without departing from his duty, give up the
least article of his honour or of his cause to the greatest earthly
potentate. Indeed, he always asserted that Mr Adams at church with his
surplice on, and Mr Adams without that ornament in any other place,
were two very different persons.

When the church rites were over Joseph led his blooming bride back to Mr
Booby's (for the distance was so very little they did not think proper
to use a coach); the whole company attended them likewise on foot; and
now a most magnificent entertainment was provided, at which parson Adams
demonstrated an appetite surprizing as well as surpassing every one
present. Indeed the only persons who betrayed any deficiency on this
occasion were those on whose account the feast was provided. They
pampered their imaginations with the much more exquisite repast which
the approach of night promised them; the thoughts of which filled both
their minds, though with different sensations; the one all desire, while
the other had her wishes tempered with fears.

At length, after a day passed with the utmost merriment, corrected by
the strictest decency, in which, however, parson Adams, being well
filled with ale and pudding, had given a loose to more facetiousness
than was usual to him, the happy, the blest moment arrived when Fanny
retired with her mother, her mother-in-law, and her sister.

She was soon undrest; for she had no jewels to deposit in their caskets,
nor fine laces to fold with the nicest exactness. Undressing to her was
properly discovering, not putting off, ornaments; for, as all her charms
were the gifts of nature, she could divest herself of none. How, reader,
shall I give thee an adequate idea of this lovely young creature? the
bloom of roses and lilies might a little illustrate her complexion, or
their smell her sweetness; but to comprehend her entirely, conceive
youth, health, bloom, neatness, and innocence, in her bridal bed;
conceive all these in their utmost perfection, and you may place the
charming Fanny's picture before your eyes.

Joseph no sooner heard she was in bed than he fled with the utmost
eagerness to her. A minute carried him into her arms, where we shall
leave this happy couple to enjoy the private rewards of their constancy;
rewards so great and sweet, that I apprehend Joseph neither envied the
noblest duke, nor Fanny the finest duchess, that night.

The third day Mr Wilson and his wife, with their son and daughter,
returned home; where they now live together in a state of bliss scarce
ever equalled. Mr Booby hath, with unprecedented generosity, given Fanny
a fortune of two thousand pounds, which Joseph hath laid out in a little
estate in the same parish with his father, which he now occupies (his
father having stocked it for him)﻿A JOURNAL OF THE PLAGUE YEAR

being observations or memorials of the most remarkable occurrences, as
well public as private, which happened in London during the last great
visitation in 1665. Written by a Citizen who continued all the while in
London. Never made public before


It was about the beginning of September, 1664, that I, among the rest of
my neighbours, heard in ordinary discourse that the plague was returned
again in Holland; for it had been very violent there, and particularly
at Amsterdam and Rotterdam, in the year 1663, whither, they say, it was
brought, some said from Italy, others from the Levant, among some goods
which were brought home by their Turkey fleet; others said it was
brought from Candia; others from Cyprus. It mattered not from whence it
came; but all agreed it was come into Holland again.

We had no such thing as printed newspapers in those days to spread
rumours and reports of things, and to improve them by the invention of
men, as I have lived to see practised since. But such things as these
were gathered from the letters of merchants and others who corresponded
abroad, and from them was handed about by word of mouth only; so that
things did not spread instantly over the whole nation, as they do now.
But it seems that the Government had a true account of it, and several
councils were held about ways to prevent its coming over; but all was
kept very private. Hence it was that this rumour died off again, and
people began to forget it as a thing we were very little concerned in,
and that we hoped was not true; till the latter end of November or the
beginning of December 1664 when two men, said to be Frenchmen, died of
the plague in Long Acre, or rather at the upper end of Drury Lane. The
family they were in endeavoured to conceal it as much as possible, but
as it had gotten some vent in the discourse of the neighbourhood, the
Secretaries of State got knowledge of it; and concerning themselves to
inquire about it, in order to be certain of the truth, two physicians
and a surgeon were ordered to go to the house and make inspection. This
they did; and finding evident tokens of the sickness upon both the
bodies that were dead, they gave their opinions publicly that they died
of the plague. Whereupon it was given in to the parish clerk, and he
also returned them to the Hall; and it was printed in the weekly bill of
mortality in the usual manner, thus--


Plague, 2. Parishes infected, 1.

The people showed a great concern at this, and began to be alarmed all
over the town, and the more, because in the last week in December 1664
another man died in the same house, and of the same distemper. And then
we were easy again for about six weeks, when none having died with any
marks of infection, it was said the distemper was gone; but after that,
I think it was about the 12th of February, another died in another
house, but in the same parish and in the same manner.

This turned the people's eyes pretty much towards that end of the town,
and the weekly bills showing an increase of burials in St Giles's parish
more than usual, it began to be suspected that the plague was among the
people at that end of the town, and that many had died of it, though
they had taken care to keep it as much from the knowledge of the public
as possible. This possessed the heads of the people very much, and few
cared to go through Drury Lane, or the other streets suspected, unless
they had extraordinary business that obliged them to it

This increase of the bills stood thus: the usual number of burials in a
week, in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and St Andrew's,
Holborn, were from twelve to seventeen or nineteen each, few more or
less; but from the time that the plague first began in St Giles's
parish, it was observed that the ordinary burials increased in number
considerably. For example:--


     From December 27 to January 3  { St Giles's      16
     "                              { St Andrew's     17

     "     January 3  "    "    10  { St Giles's      12
     "                              { St Andrew's     25

     "     January 10 "    "    17  { St Giles's      18
     "                              { St Andrew's     28

     "     January 17 "    "    24  { St Giles's      23
     "                              { St Andrew's     16

     "     January 24 "    "    31  { St Giles's      24
     "                              { St Andrew's     15

     "     January 30 " February 7  { St Giles's      21
     "                              { St Andrew's     23

     "     February 7 "     "   14  { St Giles's      24

The like increase of the bills was observed in the parishes of St
Bride's, adjoining on one side of Holborn parish, and in the parish of
St James, Clerkenwell, adjoining on the other side of Holborn; in both
which parishes the usual numbers that died weekly were from four to six
or eight, whereas at that time they were increased as follows:--


     From December 20 to December 27  { St Bride's     0
     "                                { St James's     8

     "    December 27 to January   3  { St Bride's     6
     "                                { St James's     9

     "    January  3  "    "      10  { St Bride's    11
     "                                { St James's     7

     "    January 10  "    "      17  { St Bride's    12
     "                                { St James's     9

     "    January 17  "    "      24  { St Bride's     9
     "                                { St James's    15

     "    January 24  "    "      31  { St Bride's     8
     "                                { St James's    12

     "    January 31  " February   7  { St Bride's    13
     "                                { St James's     5

     "    February 7  "    "      14  { St Bride's     12
     "                                { St James's     6

Besides this, it was observed with great uneasiness by the people that
the weekly bills in general increased very much during these weeks,
although it was at a time of the year when usually the bills are very
moderate.

The usual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week was
from about 240 or thereabouts to 300. The last was esteemed a pretty
high bill; but after this we found the bills successively increasing as
follows:--


     Buried.  Increased.
     December the 20th to the 27th               291       ...
     "     "      27th  "     3rd January        349        58
     January  the  3rd  "    10th   "            394        45
     "     "      10th  "    17th   "            415        21
     "     "      17th  "    24th   "            474        59

This last bill was really frightful, being a higher number than had been
known to have been buried in one week since the preceding visitation of
1656.

However, all this went off again, and the weather proving cold, and the
frost, which began in December, still continuing very severe even till
near the end of February, attended with sharp though moderate winds, the
bills decreased again, and the city grew healthy, and everybody began to
look upon the danger as good as over; only that still the burials in St
Giles's continued high. From the beginning of April especially they
stood at twenty-five each week, till the week from the 18th to the 25th,
when there was buried in St Giles's parish thirty, whereof two of the
plague and eight of the spotted-fever, which was looked upon as the same
thing; likewise the number that died of the spotted-fever in the whole
increased, being eight the week before, and twelve the week above-named.

This alarmed us all again, and terrible apprehensions were among the
people, especially the weather being now changed and growing warm, and
the summer being at hand. However, the next week there seemed to be some
hopes again; the bills were low, the number of the dead in all was but
388, there was none of the plague, and but four of the spotted-fever.

But the following week it returned again, and the distemper was spread
into two or three other parishes, viz., St Andrew's, Holborn; St Clement
Danes; and, to the great affliction of the city, one died within the
walls, in the parish of St Mary Woolchurch, that is to say, in
Bearbinder Lane, near Stocks Market; in all there were nine of the
plague and six of the spotted-fever. It was, however, upon inquiry found
that this Frenchman who died in Bearbinder Lane was one who, having
lived in Long Acre, near the infected houses, had removed for fear of
the distemper, not knowing that he was already infected.

This was the beginning of May, yet the weather was temperate, variable,
and cool enough, and people had still some hopes. That which encouraged
them was that the city was healthy: the whole ninety-seven parishes
buried but fifty-four, and we began to hope that, as it was chiefly
among the people at that end of the town, it might go no farther; and
the rather, because the next week, which was from the 9th of May to the
16th, there died but three, of which not one within the whole city or
liberties; and St Andrew's buried but fifteen, which was very low. 'Tis
true St Giles's buried two-and-thirty, but still, as there was but one
of the plague, people began to be easy. The whole bill also was very
low, for the week before the bill was but 347, and the week above
mentioned but 343. We continued in these hopes for a few days, but it
was but for a few, for the people were no more to be deceived thus; they
searched the houses and found that the plague was really spread every
way, and that many died of it every day. So that now all our
extenuations abated, and it was no more to be concealed; nay, it quickly
appeared that the infection had spread itself beyond all hopes of
abatement. That in the parish of St Giles it was gotten into several
streets, and several families lay all sick together; and, accordingly,
in the weekly bill for the next week the thing began to show itself.
There was indeed but fourteen set down of the plague, but this was all
knavery and collusion, for in St Giles's parish they buried forty in
all, whereof it was certain most of them died of the plague, though they
were set down of other distempers; and though the number of all the
burials were not increased above thirty-two, and the whole bill being
but 385, yet there was fourteen of the spotted-fever, as well as
fourteen of the plague; and we took it for granted upon the whole that
there were fifty died that week of the plague.

The next bill was from the 23rd of May to the 30th, when the number of
the plague was seventeen. But the burials in St Giles's were fifty-
three--a frightful number!--of whom they set down but nine of the
plague; but on an examination more strictly by the justices of peace,
and at the Lord Mayor's request, it was found there were twenty more who
were really dead of the plague in that parish, but had been set down of
the spotted-fever or other distempers, besides others concealed.

But those were trifling things to what followed immediately after; for
now the weather set in hot, and from the first week in June the
infection spread in a dreadful manner, and the bills rose high; the
articles of the fever, spotted-fever, and teeth began to swell; for all
that could conceal their distempers did it, to prevent their neighbours
shunning and refusing to converse with them, and also to prevent
authority shutting up their houses; which, though it was not yet
practised, yet was threatened, and people were extremely terrified at
the thoughts of it.

The second week in June, the parish of St Giles, where still the weight
of the infection lay, buried 120, whereof though the bills said but
sixty-eight of the plague, everybody said there had been 100 at least,
calculating it from the usual number of funerals in that parish, as
above.

Till this week the city continued free, there having never any died,
except that one Frenchman whom I mentioned before, within the whole
ninety-seven parishes. Now there died four within the city, one in Wood
Street, one in Fenchurch Street, and two in Crooked Lane. Southwark was
entirely free, having not one yet died on that side of the water.

I lived without Aldgate, about midway between Aldgate Church and
Whitechappel Bars, on the left hand or north side of the street; and as
the distemper had not reached to that side of the city, our
neighbourhood continued very easy. But at the other end of the town
their consternation was very great: and the richer sort of people,
especially the nobility and gentry from the west part of the city,
thronged out of town with their families and servants in an unusual
manner; and this was more particularly seen in Whitechappel; that is to
say, the Broad Street where I lived; indeed, nothing was to be seen but
waggons and carts, with goods, women, servants, children, &c.; coaches
filled with people of the better sort and horsemen attending them, and
all hurrying away; then empty waggons and carts appeared, and spare
horses with servants, who, it was apparent, were returning or sent from
the countries to fetch more people; besides innumerable numbers of men
on horseback, some alone, others with servants, and, generally speaking,
all loaded with baggage and fitted out for travelling, as anyone might
perceive by their appearance.

This was a very terrible and melancholy thing to see, and as it was a
sight which I could not but look on from morning to night (for indeed
there was nothing else of moment to be seen), it filled me with very
serious thoughts of the misery that was coming upon the city, and the
unhappy condition of those that would be left in it.

This hurry of the people was such for some weeks that there was no
getting at the Lord Mayor's door without exceeding difficulty; there
were such pressing and crowding there to get passes and certificates of
health for such as travelled abroad, for without these there was no
being admitted to pass through the towns upon the road, or to lodge in
any inn. Now, as there had none died in the city for all this time, my
Lord Mayor gave certificates of health without any difficulty to all
those who lived in the ninety-seven parishes, and to those within the
liberties too for a while.

This hurry, I say, continued some weeks, that is to say, all the month
of May and June, and the more because it was rumoured that an order of
the Government was to be issued out to place turnpikes and barriers on
the road to prevent people travelling, and that the towns on the road
would not suffer people from London to pass for fear of bringing the
infection along with them, though neither of these rumours had any
foundation but in the imagination, especially at-first.

I now began to consider seriously with myself concerning my own case,
and how I should dispose of myself; that is to say, whether I should
resolve to stay in London or shut up my house and flee, as many of my
neighbours did. I have set this particular down so fully, because I know
not but it may be of moment to those who come after me, if they come to
be brought to the same distress, and to the same manner of making their
choice; and therefore I desire this account may pass with them rather
for a direction to themselves to act by than a history of my actings,
seeing it may not be of one farthing value to them to note what became
of me.

I had two important things before me: the one was the carrying on my
business and shop, which was considerable, and in which was embarked all
my effects in the world; and the other was the preservation of my life
in so dismal a calamity as I saw apparently was coming upon the whole
city, and which, however great it was, my fears perhaps, as well as
other people's, represented to be much greater than it could be.

The first consideration was of great moment to me; my trade was a
saddler, and as my dealings were chiefly not by a shop or chance trade,
but among the merchants trading to the English colonies in America, so
my effects lay very much in the hands of such. I was a single man, 'tis
true, but I had a family of servants whom I kept at my business; had a
house, shop, and warehouses filled with goods; and, in short, to leave
them all as things in such a case must be left (that is to say, without
any overseer or person fit to be trusted with them), had been to hazard
the loss not only of my trade, but of my goods, and indeed of all I had
in the world.

I had an elder brother at the same time in London, and not many years
before come over from Portugal: and advising with him, his answer was in
three words, the same that was given in another case quite different,
viz., 'Master, save thyself.' In a word, he was for my retiring into the
country, as he resolved to do himself with his family; telling me what
he had, it seems, heard abroad, that the best preparation for the plague
was to run away from it. As to my argument of losing my trade, my goods,
or debts, he quite confuted me. He told me the same thing which I argued
for my staying, viz., that I would trust God with my safety and health,
was the strongest repulse to my pretensions of losing my trade and my
goods; 'for', says he, 'is it not as reasonable that you should trust
God with the chance or risk of losing your trade, as that you should
stay in so eminent a point of danger, and trust Him with your life?'

I could not argue that I was in any strait as to a place where to go,
having several friends and relations in Northamptonshire, whence our
family first came from; and particularly, I had an only sister in
Lincolnshire, very willing to receive and entertain me.

My brother, who had already sent his wife and two children into
Bedfordshire, and resolved to follow them, pressed my going very
earnestly; and I had once resolved to comply with his desires, but at
that time could get no horse; for though it is true all the people did
not go out of the city of London, yet I may venture to say that in a
manner all the horses did; for there was hardly a horse to be bought or
hired in the whole city for some weeks. Once I resolved to travel on
foot with one servant, and, as many did, lie at no inn, but carry a
soldier's tent with us, and so lie in the fields, the weather being very
warm, and no danger from taking cold. I say, as many did, because
several did so at last, especially those who had been in the armies in
the war which had not been many years past; and I must needs say that,
speaking of second causes, had most of the people that travelled done
so, the plague had not been carried into so many country towns and
houses as it was, to the great damage, and indeed to the ruin, of
abundance of people.

But then my servant, whom I had intended to take down with me, deceived
me; and being frighted at the increase of the distemper, and not knowing
when I should go, he took other measures, and left me, so I was put off
for that time; and, one way or other, I always found that to appoint to
go away was always crossed by some accident or other, so as to
disappoint and put it off again; and this brings in a story which
otherwise might be thought a needless digression, viz., about these
disappointments being from Heaven.

I mention this story also as the best method I can advise any person to
take in such a case, especially if he be one that makes conscience of
his duty, and would be directed what to do in it, namely, that he should
keep his eye upon the particular providences which occur at that time,
and look upon them complexly, as they regard one another, and as all
together regard the question before him: and then, I think, he may
safely take them for intimations from Heaven of what is his unquestioned
duty to do in such a case; I mean as to going away from or staying in
the place where we dwell, when visited with an infectious distemper.

It came very warmly into my mind one morning, as I was musing on this
particular thing, that as nothing attended us without the direction or
permission of Divine Power, so these disappointments must have something
in them extraordinary; and I ought to consider whether it did not
evidently point out, or intimate to me, that it was the will of Heaven I
should not go. It immediately followed in my thoughts, that if it really
was from God that I should stay, He was able effectually to preserve me
in the midst of all the death and danger that would surround me; and
that if I attempted to secure myself by fleeing from my habitation, and
acted contrary to these intimations, which I believe to be Divine, it
was a kind of flying from God, and that He could cause His justice to
overtake me when and where He thought fit.

These thoughts quite turned my resolutions again, and when I came to
discourse with my brother again I told him that I inclined to stay and
take my lot in that station in which God had placed me, and that it
seemed to be made more especially my duty, on the account of what I have
said.

My brother, though a very religious man himself, laughed at all I had
suggested about its being an intimation from Heaven, and told me several
stories of such foolhardy people, as he called them, as I was; that I
ought indeed to submit to it as a work of Heaven if I had been any way
disabled by distempers or diseases, and that then not being able to go,
I ought to acquiesce in the direction of Him, who, having been my Maker,
had an undisputed right of sovereignty in disposing of me, and that then
there had been no difficulty to determine which was the call of His
providence and which was not; but that I should take it as an intimation
from Heaven that I should not go out of town, only because I could not
hire a horse to go, or my fellow was run away that was to attend me, was
ridiculous, since at the time I had my health and limbs, and other
servants, and might with ease travel a day or two on foot, and having a
good certificate of being in perfect health, might either hire a horse
or take post on the road, as I thought fit.

Then he proceeded to tell me of the mischievous consequences which
attended the presumption of the Turks and Mahometans in Asia and in
other places where he had been (for my brother, being a merchant, was a
few years before, as I have already observed, returned from abroad,
coming last from Lisbon), and how, presuming upon their professed
predestinating notions, and of every man's end being predetermined and
unalterably beforehand decreed, they would go unconcerned into infected
places and converse with infected persons, by which means they died at
the rate of ten or fifteen thousand a week, whereas the Europeans or
Christian merchants, who kept themselves retired and reserved, generally
escaped the contagion.

Upon these arguments my brother changed my resolutions again, and I
began to resolve to go, and accordingly made all things ready; for, in
short, the infection increased round me, and the bills were risen to
almost seven hundred a week, and my brother told me he would venture to
stay no longer. I desired him to let me consider of it but till the next
day, and I would resolve: and as I had already prepared everything as
well as I could as to MY business, and whom to entrust my affairs with,
I had little to do but to resolve.

I went home that evening greatly oppressed in my mind, irresolute, and
not knowing what to do. I had set the evening wholly--apart to consider
seriously about it, and was all alone; for already people had, as it
were by a general consent, taken up the custom of not going out of doors
after sunset; the reasons I shall have occasion to say more of by-and-
by.

In the retirement of this evening I endeavoured to resolve, first, what
was my duty to do, and I stated the arguments with which my brother had
pressed me to go into the country, and I set, against them the strong
impressions which I had on my mind for staying; the visible call I
seemed to have from the particular circumstance of my calling, and the
care due from me for the preservation of my effects, which were, as I
might say, my estate; also the intimations which I thought I had from
Heaven, that to me signified a kind of direction to venture; and it
occurred to me that if I had what I might call a direction to stay, I
ought to suppose it contained a promise of being preserved if I obeyed.

This lay close to me, and my mind seemed more and more encouraged to
stay than ever, and supported with a secret satisfaction that I should
be kept. Add to this, that, turning over the Bible which lay before me,
and while my thoughts were more than ordinarily serious upon the
question, I cried out, 'Well, I know not what to do; Lord, direct me I'
and the like; and at that juncture I happened to stop turning over the
book at the gist Psalm, and casting my eye on the second verse, I read
on to the seventh verse exclusive, and after that included the tenth, as
follows: 'I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
God, in Him will I trust. Surely He shall deliver thee from the snare of
the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with
His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be
thy shield and buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by
night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; nor for the pestilence that
walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A
thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but
it shall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and
see the reward of the wicked. Because thou hast made the Lord, which is
my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation; there shall no evil
befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling,' &C.

I scarce need tell the reader that from that moment I resolved that I
would stay in the town, and casting myself entirely upon the goodness
and protection of the Almighty, would not seek any other shelter
whatever; and that, as my times were in His hands, He was as able to
keep me in a time of the infection as in a time of health; and if He did
not think fit to deliver me, still I was in His hands, and it was meet
He should do with me as should seem good to Him.

With this resolution I went to bed; and I was further confirmed in it
the next day by the woman being taken ill with whom I had intended to
entrust my house and all my affairs. But I had a further obligation laid
on me on the same side, for the next day I found myself very much out of
order also, so that if I would have gone away, I could not, and I
continued ill three or four days, and this entirely determined my stay;
so I took my leave of my brother, who went away to Dorking, in Surrey,
and afterwards fetched a round farther into Buckinghamshire or
Bedfordshire, to a retreat he had found out there for his family.

It was a very ill time to be sick in, for if any one complained, it was
immediately said he had the plague; and though I had indeed no symptom
of that distemper, yet being very ill, both in my head and in my
stomach, I was not without apprehension that I really was infected; but
in about three days I grew better; the third night I rested well,
sweated a little, and was much refreshed. The apprehensions of its being
the infection went also quite away with my illness, and I went about my
business as usual.

These things, however, put off all my thoughts of going into the
country; and my brother also being gone, I had no more debate either
with him or with myself on that subject.

It was now mid-July, and the plague, which had chiefly raged at the
other end of the town, and, as I said before, in the parishes of St
Giles, St Andrew's, Holborn, and towards Westminster, began to now come
eastward towards the part where I lived. It was to be observed, indeed,
that it did not come straight on towards us; for the city, that is to
say, within the walls, was indifferently healthy still; nor was it got
then very much over the water into Southwark; for though there died that
week 1268 of all distempers, whereof it might be supposed above 600 died
of the plague, yet there was but twenty-eight in the whole city, within
the walls, and but nineteen in Southwark, Lambeth parish included;
whereas in the parishes of St Giles and St Martin-in-the-Fields alone
there died 421.

But we perceived the infection kept chiefly in the out-parishes, which
being very populous, and fuller also of poor, the distemper found more
to prey upon than in the city, as I shall observe afterwards. We
perceived, I say, the distemper to draw our way, viz., by the parishes
of Clarkenwell, Cripplegate, Shoreditch, and Bishopsgate; which last two
parishes joining to Aldgate, Whitechappel, and Stepney, the infection
came at length to spread its utmost rage and violence in those parts,
even when it abated at the western parishes where it began.

It was very strange to observe that in this particular week, from the
4th to the 11th of July, when, as I have observed, there died near 400
of the plague in the two parishes of St Martin and St Giles-in-the-
Fields only, there died in the parish of Aldgate but four, in the parish
of Whitechappel three, in the parish of Stepney but one.

Likewise in the next week, from the 11th of July to the 18th, when the
week's bill was 1761, yet there died no more of the plague, on the whole
Southwark side of the water, than sixteen. But this face of things soon
changed, and it began to thicken in Cripplegate parish especially, and
in Clarkenwell; so that by the second week in August, Cripplegate parish
alone buried 886, and Clarkenwell 155. Of the first, 850 might well be
reckoned to die of the plague; and of the last, the bill itself said 145
were of the plague.

During the month of July, and while, as I have observed, our part of the
town seemed to be spared in comparison of the west part, I went
ordinarily about the streets, as my business required, and particularly
went generally once in a day, or in two days, into the city, to my
brother's house, which he had given me charge of, and to see if it was
safe; and having the key in my pocket, I used to go into the house, and
over most of the rooms, to see that all was well; for though it be
something wonderful to tell, that any should have hearts so hardened in
the midst of such a calamity as to rob and steal, yet certain it is that
all sorts of villainies, and even levities and debaucheries, were then
practised in the town as openly as ever--I will not say quite as
frequently, because the numbers of people were many ways lessened.

But the city itself began now to be visited too, I mean within the
walls; but the number of people there were indeed extremely lessened by
so great a multitude having been gone into the country; and even all
this month of July they continued to flee, though not in such multitudes
as formerly. In August, indeed, they fled in such a manner that I began
to think there would be really none but magistrates and servants left in
the city.

As they fled now out of the city, so I should observe that the Court
removed early, viz., in the month of June, and went to Oxford, where it
pleased God to preserve them; and the distemper did not, as I heard of,
so much as touch them, for which I cannot say that I ever saw they
showed any great token of thankfulness, and hardly anything of
reformation, though they did not want being told that their crying vices
might without breach of charity be said to have gone far in bringing
that terrible judgement upon the whole nation.

The face of London was--now indeed strangely altered: I mean the whole
mass of buildings, city, liberties, suburbs, Westminster, Southwark, and
altogether; for as to the particular part called the city, or within the
walls, that was not yet much infected. But in the whole the face of
things, I say, was much altered; sorrow and sadness sat upon every face;
and though some parts were not yet overwhelmed, yet all looked deeply
concerned; and, as we saw it apparently coming on, so every one looked
on himself and his family as in the utmost danger. Were it possible to
represent those times exactly to those that did not see them, and give
the reader due ideas of the horror 'that everywhere presented itself, it
must make just impressions upon their minds and fill them with surprise.
London might well be said to be all in tears; the mourners did not go
about the streets indeed, for nobody put on black or made a formal dress
of mourning for their nearest friends; but the voice of mourners was
truly heard in the streets. The shrieks of women and children at the
windows and doors of their houses, where their dearest relations were
perhaps dying, or just dead, were so frequent to be heard as we passed
the streets, that it was enough to pierce the stoutest heart in the
world to hear them. Tears and lamentations were seen almost in every
house, especially in the first part of the visitation; for towards the
latter end men's hearts were hardened, and death was so always before
their eyes, that they did not so much concern themselves for the loss of
their friends, expecting that themselves should be summoned the next
hour.

Business led me out sometimes to the other end of the town, even when
the sickness was chiefly there; and as the thing was new to me, as well
as to everybody else, it was a most surprising thing to see those
streets which were usually so thronged now grown desolate, and so few
people to be seen in them, that if I had been a stranger and at a loss
for my way, I might sometimes have gone the length of a whole street (I
mean of the by-streets), and seen nobody to direct me except watchmen
set at the doors of such houses as were shut up, of which I shall speak
presently.

One day, being at that part of the town on some special business,
curiosity led me to observe things more than usually, and indeed I
walked a great way where I had no business. I went up Holborn, and there
the street was full of people, but they walked in the middle of the
great street, neither on one side or other, because, as I suppose, they
would not mingle with anybody that came out of houses, or meet with
smells and scent from houses that might be infected.

The Inns of Court were all shut up; nor were very many of the lawyers in
the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn, to be seen there. Everybody
was at peace; there was no occasion for lawyers; besides, it being in
the time of the vacation too, they were generally gone into the country.
Whole rows of houses in some places were shut close up, the inhabitants
all fled, and only a watchman or two left.

When I speak of rows of houses being shut up, I do not mean shut up by
the magistrates, but that great numbers of persons followed the Court,
by the necessity of their employments and other dependences; and as
others retired, really frighted with the distemper, it was a mere
desolating of some of the streets. But the fright was not yet near so
great in the city, abstractly so called, and particularly because,
though they were at first in a most inexpressible consternation, yet as
I have observed that the distemper intermitted often at first, so they
were, as it were, alarmed and unalarmed again, and this several times,
till it began to be familiar to them; and that even when it appeared
violent, yet seeing it did not presently spread into the city, or the
east and south parts, the people began to take courage, and to be, as I
may say, a little hardened. It is true a vast many people fled, as I
have observed, yet they were chiefly from the west end of the town, and
from that we call the heart of the city: that is to say, among the
wealthiest of the people, and such people as were unencumbered with
trades and business. But of the rest, the generality stayed, and seemed
to abide the worst; so that in the place we calf the Liberties, and in
the suburbs, in Southwark, and in the east part, such as Wapping,
Ratcliff, Stepney, Rotherhithe, and the like, the people generally
stayed, except here and there a few wealthy families, who, as above, did
not depend upon their business.

It must not be forgot here that the city and suburbs were prodigiously
full of people at the time of this visitation, I mean at the time that
it began; for though I have lived to see a further increase, and mighty
throngs of people settling in London more than ever, yet we had always a
notion that the numbers of people which, the wars being over, the armies
disbanded, and the royal family and the monarchy being restored, had
flocked to London to settle in business, or to depend upon and attend
the Court for rewards of services, preferments, and the like, was such
that the town was computed to have in it above a hundred thousand people
more than ever it held before; nay, some took upon them to say it had
twice as many, because all the ruined families of the royal party
flocked hither. All the old soldiers set up trades here, and abundance
of families settled here. Again, the Court brought with them a great
flux of pride, and new fashions. All people were grown gay and
luxurious, and the joy of the Restoration had brought a vast many
families to London.

I often thought that as Jerusalem was besieged by the Romans when the
Jews were assembled together to celebrate the Passover--by which means
an incredible number of people were surprised there who would otherwise
have been in other countries--so the plague entered London when an
incredible increase of people had happened occasionally, by the
particular circumstances above-named. As this conflux of the people to a
youthful and gay Court made a great trade in the city, especially in
everything that belonged to fashion and finery, so it drew by
consequence a great number of workmen, manufacturers, and the like,
being mostly poor people who depended upon their labour. And I remember
in particular that in a representation to my Lord Mayor of the condition
of the poor, it was estimated that there were no less than an hundred
thousand riband-weavers in and about the city, the chiefest number of
whom lived then in the parishes of Shoreditch, Stepney, Whitechappel,
and Bishopsgate, that, namely, about Spitalfields; that is to say, as
Spitalfields was then, for it was not so large as now by one fifth part.

By this, however, the number of people in the whole may be judged of;
and, indeed, I often wondered that, after the prodigious numbers of
people that went away at first, there was yet so great a multitude left
as it appeared there was.

But I must go back again to the beginning of this surprising time. While
the fears of the people were young, they were increased strangely by
several odd accidents which, put altogether, it was really a wonder the
whole body of the people did not rise as one man and abandon their
dwellings, leaving the place as a space of ground designed by Heaven for
an Akeldama, doomed to be destroyed from the face of the earth, and that
all that would be found in it would perish with it. I shall name but a
few of these things; but sure they were so many, and so many wizards and
cunning people propagating them, that I have often wondered there was
any (women especially) left behind.

In the first place, a blazing star or comet appeared for several months
before the plague, as there did the year after another, a little before
the fire. The old women and the phlegmatic hypochondriac part of the
other sex, whom I could almost call old women too, remarked (especially
afterward, though not till both those judgements were over) that those
two comets passed directly over the city, and that so very near the
houses that it was plain they imported something peculiar to the city
alone; that the comet before the pestilence was of a faint, dull,
languid colour, and its motion very heavy, Solemn, and slow; but that
the comet before the fire was bright and sparkling, or, as others said,
flaming, and its motion swift and furious; and that, accordingly, one
foretold a heavy judgement, slow but severe, terrible and frightful, as
was the plague; but the other foretold a stroke, sudden, swift, and
fiery as the conflagration. Nay, so particular some people were, that as
they looked upon that comet preceding the fire, they fancied that they
not only saw it pass swiftly and fiercely, and could perceive the motion
with their eye, but even they heard it; that it made a rushing, mighty
noise, fierce and terrible, though at a distance, and but just
perceivable.

I saw both these stars, and, I must confess, had so much of the common
notion of such things in my head, that I was apt to look upon them as
the forerunners and warnings of God's judgements; and especially when,
after the plague had followed the first, I yet saw another of the like
kind, I could not but say God had not yet sufficiently scourged the
city.

But I could not at the same time carry these things to the height that
others did, knowing, too, that natural causes are assigned by the
astronomers for such things, and that their motions and even their
revolutions are calculated, or pretended to be calculated, so that they
cannot be so perfectly called the forerunners or foretellers, much less
the procurers, of such events as pestilence, war, fire, and the like.

But let my thoughts and the thoughts of the philosophers be, or have
been, what they will, these things had a more than ordinary influence
upon the minds of the common people, and they had almost universal
melancholy apprehensions of some dreadful calamity and judgement coming
upon the city; and this principally from the sight of this comet, and
the little alarm that was given in December by two people dying at St
Giles's, as above.

The apprehensions of the people were likewise strangely increased by the
error of the times; in which, I think, the people, from what principle I
cannot imagine, were more addicted to prophecies and astrological
conjurations, dreams, and old wives' tales than ever they were before or
since. Whether this unhappy temper was originally raised by the follies
of some people who got money by it--that is to say, by printing
predictions and prognostications--I know not; but certain it is, books
frighted them terribly, such as Lilly's Almanack, Gadbury's Astrological
Predictions, Poor Robin's Almanack, and the like; also several pretended
religious books, one entitled, Come out of her, my People, lest you be
Partaker of her Plagues; another called, Fair Warning; another,
Britain's Remembrancer; and many such, all, or most part of which,
foretold, directly or covertly, the ruin of the city. Nay, some were so
enthusiastically bold as to run about the streets with their oral
predictions, pretending they were sent to preach to the city; and one in
particular, who, like Jonah to Nineveh, cried in the streets, 'Yet forty
days, and London shall be destroyed.' I will not be positive whether he
said yet forty days or yet a few days. Another ran about naked, except a
pair of drawers about his waist, crying day and night, like a man that
Josephus mentions, who cried, 'Woe to Jerusalem!' a little before the
destruction of that city. So this poor naked creature cried, 'Oh, the
great and the dreadful God!' and said no more, but repeated those words
continually, with a voice and countenance full of horror, a swift pace;
and nobody could ever find him to stop or rest, or take any sustenance,
at least that ever I could hear of. I met this poor creature several
times in the streets, and would have spoken to him, but he would not
enter into speech with me or any one else, but held on his dismal cries
continually.

These things terrified the people to the last degree, and especially
when two or three times, as I have mentioned already, they found one or
two in the bills dead of the plague at St Giles's.

Next to these public things were the dreams of old women, or, I should
say, the interpretation of old women upon other people's dreams; and
these put abundance of people even out of their wits. Some heard voices
warning them to be gone, for that there would be such a plague in
London, so that the living would not be able to bury the dead. Others
saw apparitions in the air; and I must be allowed to say of both, I hope
without breach of charity, that they heard voices that never spake, and
saw sights that never appeared; but the imagination of the people was
really turned wayward and possessed. And no wonder, if they who were
poring continually at the clouds saw shapes and figures, representations
and appearances, which had nothing in them but air, and vapour. Here
they told us they saw a flaming sword held in a hand coming out of a
cloud, with a point hanging directly over the city; there they saw
hearses and coffins in the air carrying to be buried; and there again,
heaps of dead bodies lying unburied, and the like, just as the
imagination of the poor terrified people furnished them with matter to
work upon. So hypochondriac fancies represent Ships, armies, battles in
the firmament; Till steady eyes the exhalations solve, And all to its
first matter, cloud, resolve.

I could fill this account with the strange relations such people gave
every day of what they had seen; and every one was so positive of their
having seen what they pretended to see, that there was no contradicting
them without breach of friendship, or being accounted rude and
unmannerly on the one hand, and profane and impenetrable on the other.
One time before the plague was begun (otherwise than as I have said in
St Giles's), I think it was in March, seeing a crowd of people in the
street, I joined with them to satisfy my curiosity, and found them all
staring up into the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to
her, which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his
hand, waving it or brandishing it over his head. She described every
part of the figure to the life, showed them the motion and the form, and
the poor people came into it so eagerly, and with so much readiness;
'Yes, I see it all plainly,' says one; 'there's the sword as plain as
can be.' Another saw the angel. One saw his very face, and cried out
what a glorious creature he was! One saw one thing, and one another. I
looked as earnestly as the rest, but perhaps not with so much
willingness to be imposed upon; and I said, indeed, that I could see
nothing but a white cloud, bright on one side by the shining of the sun
upon the other part. The woman endeavoured to show it me, but could not
make me confess that I saw it, which, indeed, if I had I must have lied.
But the woman, turning upon me, looked in my face, and fancied I
laughed, in which her imagination deceived her too, for I really did not
laugh, but was very seriously reflecting how the poor people were
terrified by the force of their own imagination. However, she turned
from me, called me profane fellow, and a scoffer; told me that it was a
time of God's anger, and dreadful judgements were approaching, and that
despisers such as I should wander and perish.

The people about her seemed disgusted as well as she; and I found there
was no persuading them that I did not laugh at them, and that I should
be rather mobbed by them than be able to undeceive them. So I left them;
and this appearance passed for as real as the blazing star itself.

Another encounter I had in the open day also; and this was in going
through a narrow passage from Petty France into Bishopsgate Churchyard,
by a row of alms-houses. There are two churchyards to Bishopsgate church
or parish; one we go over to pass from the place called Petty France
into Bishopsgate Street, coming out just by the church door; the other
is on the side of the narrow passage where the alms-houses are on the
left; and a dwarf-wall with a palisado on it on the right hand, and the
city wall on the other side more to the right.

In this narrow passage stands a man looking through between the
palisadoes into the burying-place, and as many people as the narrowness
of the passage would admit to stop, without hindering the passage of
others, and he was talking mightily eagerly to them, and pointing now to
one place, then to another, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking
upon such a gravestone there. He described the shape, the posture, and
the movement of it so exactly that it was the greatest matter of
amazement to him in the world that everybody did not see it as well as
he. On a sudden he would cry, 'There it is; now it comes this way.'
Then, 'Tis turned back'; till at length he persuaded the people into so
firm a belief of it, that one fancied he saw it, and another fancied he
saw it; and thus he came every day making a strange hubbub, considering
it was in so narrow a passage, till Bishopsgate clock struck eleven, and
then the ghost would seem to start, and, as if he were called away,
disappeared on a sudden.

I looked earnestly every way, and at the very moment that this man
directed, but could not see the least appearance of anything; but so
positive was this poor man, that he gave the people the vapours in
abundance, and sent them away trembling and frighted, till at length few
people that knew of it cared to go through that passage, and hardly
anybody by night on any account whatever.

This ghost, as the poor man affirmed, made signs to the houses, and to
the ground, and to the people, plainly intimating, or else they so
understanding it, that abundance of the people should come to be buried
in that churchyard, as indeed happened; but that he saw such aspects I
must acknowledge I never believed, nor could I see anything of it
myself, though I looked most earnestly to see it, if possible.

These things serve to show how far the people were really overcome with
delusions; and as they had a notion of the approach of a visitation, all
their predictions ran upon a most dreadful plague, which should lay the
whole city, and even the kingdom, waste, and should destroy almost all
the nation, both man and beast.

To this, as I said before, the astrologers added stories of the
conjunctions of planets in a malignant manner and with a mischievous
influence, one of which conjunctions was to happen, and did happen, in
October, and the other in November; and they filled the people's heads
with predictions on these signs of the heavens, intimating that those
conjunctions foretold drought, famine, and pestilence. In the two first
of them, however, they were entirely mistaken, for we had no droughty
season, but in the beginning of the year a hard frost, which lasted from
December almost to March, and after that moderate weather, rather warm
than hot, with refreshing winds, and, in short, very seasonable weather,
and also several very great rains.

Some endeavours were used to suppress the printing of such books as
terrified the people, and to frighten the dispersers of them, some of
whom were taken up; but nothing was done in it, as I am informed, the
Government being unwilling to exasperate the people, who were, as I may
say, all out of their wits already.

Neither can I acquit those ministers that in their sermons rather sank
than lifted up the hearts of their hearers. Many of them no doubt did it
for the strengthening the resolution of the people, and especially for
quickening them to repentance, but it certainly answered not their end,
at least not in proportion to the injury it did another way; and indeed,
as God Himself through the whole Scriptures rather draws to Him by
invitations and calls to turn to Him and live, than drives us by terror
and amazement, so I must confess I thought the ministers should have
done also, imitating our blessed Lord and Master in this, that His whole
Gospel is full of declarations from heaven of God's mercy, and His
readiness to receive penitents and forgive them, complaining, 'Ye will
not come unto Me that ye may have life', and that therefore His Gospel
is called the Gospel of Peace and the Gospel of Grace.

But we had some good men, and that of all persuasions and opinions,
whose discourses were full of terror, who spoke nothing but dismal
things; and as they brought the people together with a kind of horror,
sent them away in tears, prophesying nothing but evil tidings,
terrifying the people with the apprehensions of being utterly destroyed,
not guiding them, at least not enough, to cry to heaven for mercy.

It was, indeed, a time of very unhappy breaches among us in matters of
religion. Innumerable sects and divisions and separate opinions
prevailed among the people. The Church of England was restored, indeed,
with the restoration of the monarchy, about four years before; but the
ministers and preachers of the Presbyterians and Independents, and of
all the other sorts of professions, had begun to gather separate
societies and erect altar against altar, and all those had their
meetings for worship apart, as they have now, but not so many then, the
Dissenters being not thoroughly formed into a body as they are since;
and those congregations which were thus gathered together were yet but
few. And even those that were, the Government did not allow, but
endeavoured to suppress them and shut up their meetings.

But the visitation reconciled them again, at least for a time, and many
of the best and most valuable ministers and preachers of the Dissenters
were suffered to go into the churches where the incumbents were fled
away, as many were, not being able to stand it; and the people flocked
without distinction to hear them preach, not much inquiring who or what
opinion they were of. But after the sickness was over, that spirit of
charity abated; and every church being again supplied with their own
ministers, or others presented where the minister was dead, things
returned to their old channel again.

One mischief always introduces another. These terrors and apprehensions
of the people led them into a thousand weak, foolish, and wicked things,
which they wanted not a sort of people really wicked to encourage them
to: and this was running about to fortune-tellers, cunning-men, and
astrologers to know their fortune, or, as it is vulgarly expressed, to
have their fortunes told them, their nativities calculated, and the
like; and this folly presently made the town swarm with a wicked
generation of pretenders to magic, to the black art, as they called it,
and I know not what; nay, to a thousand worse dealings with the devil
than they were really guilty of. And this trade grew so open and so
generally practised that it became common to have signs and inscriptions
set up at doors: 'Here lives a fortune-teller', 'Here lives an
astrologer', 'Here you may have your nativity calculated', and the like;
and Friar Bacon's brazen-head, which was the usual sign of these
people's dwellings, was to be seen almost in every street, or else the
sign of Mother Shipton, or of Merlin's head, and the like.

With what blind, absurd, and ridiculous stuff these oracles of the devil
pleased and satisfied the people I really know not, but certain it is
that innumerable attendants crowded about their doors every day. And if
but a grave fellow in a velvet jacket, a band, and a black coat, which
was the habit those quack-conjurers generally went in, was but seen in
the streets the people would follow them in crowds, and ask them
questions as they went along.

I need not mention what a horrid delusion this was, or what it tended
to; but there was no remedy for it till the plague itself put an end to
it all--and, I suppose, cleared the town of most of those calculators
themselves. One mischief was, that if the poor people asked these mock
astrologers whether there would be a plague or no, they all agreed in
general to answer 'Yes', for that kept up their trade. And had the
people not been kept in a fright about that, the wizards would presently
have been rendered useless, and their craft had been at an end. But they
always talked to them of such-and-such influences of the stars, of the
conjunctions of such-and-such planets, which must necessarily bring
sickness and distempers, and consequently the plague. And some had the
assurance to tell them the plague was begun already, which was too true,
though they that said so knew nothing of the matter.

The ministers, to do them justice, and preachers of most sorts that were
serious and understanding persons, thundered against these and other
wicked practices, and exposed the folly as well as the wickedness of
them together, and the most sober and judicious people despised and
abhorred them. But it was impossible to make any impression upon the
middling people and the working labouring poor. Their fears were
predominant over all their passions, and they threw away their money in
a most distracted manner upon those whimsies. Maid-servants especially,
and men-servants, were the chief of their customers, and their question
generally was, after the first demand of 'Will there be a plague?' I
say, the next question was, 'Oh, sir I for the Lord's sake, what will
become of me? Will my mistress keep me, or will she turn me off? Will
she stay here, or will she go into the country? And if she goes into the
country, will she take me with her, or leave me here to be starved and
undone?' And the like of menservants.

The truth is, the case of poor servants was very dismal, as I shall have
occasion to mention again by-and-by, for it was apparent a prodigious
number of them would be turned away, and it was so. And of them
abundance perished, and particularly of those that these false prophets
had flattered with hopes that they should be continued in their
services, and carried with their masters and mistresses into the
country; and had not public charity provided for these poor creatures,
whose number was exceeding great and in all cases of this nature must be
so, they would have been in the worst condition of any people in the
city.

These things agitated the minds of the common people for many months,
while the first apprehensions were upon them, and while the plague was
not, as I may say, yet broken out. But I must also not forget that the
more serious part of the inhabitants behaved after another manner. The
Government encouraged their devotion, and appointed public prayers and
days of fasting and humiliation, to make public confession of sin and
implore the mercy of God to avert the dreadful judgement which hung over
their heads; and it is not to be expressed with what alacrity the people
of all persuasions embraced the occasion; how they flocked to the
churches and meetings, and they were all so thronged that there was
often no coming near, no, not to the very doors of the largest churches.
Also there were daily prayers appointed morning and evening at several
churches, and days of private praying at other places; at all which the
people attended, I say, with an uncommon devotion. Several private
families also, as well of one opinion as of another, kept family fasts,
to which they admitted their near relations only. So that, in a word,
those people who were really serious and religious applied themselves in
a truly Christian manner to the proper work of repentance and
humiliation, as a Christian people ought to do.

Again, the public showed that they would bear their share in these
things; the very Court, which was then gay and luxurious, put on a face
of just concern for the public danger. All the plays and interludes
which, after the manner of the French Court, had been set up, and began
to increase among us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, public
dancing-rooms, and music-houses, which multiplied and began to debauch
the manners of the people, were shut up and suppressed; and the jack-
puddings, merry-andrews, puppet-shows, rope-dancers, and such-like
doings, which had bewitched the poor common people, shut up their shops,
finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were agitated with
other things, and a kind of sadness and horror at these things sat upon
the countenances even of the common people. Death was before their eyes,
and everybody began to think of their graves, not of mirth and
diversions.

But even those wholesome reflections--which, rightly managed, would have
most happily led the people to fall upon their knees, make confession of
their sins, and look up to their merciful Saviour for pardon, imploring
His compassion on them in such a time of their distress, by which we
might have been as a second Nineveh--had a quite contrary extreme in the
common people, who, ignorant and stupid in their reflections as they
were brutishly wicked and thoughtless before, were now led by their
fright to extremes of folly; and, as I have said before, that they ran
to conjurers and witches, and all sorts of deceivers, to know what
should become of them (who fed their fears, and kept them always alarmed
and awake on purpose to delude them and pick their pockets), so they
were as mad upon their running after quacks and mountebanks, and every
practising old woman, for medicines and remedies; storing themselves
with such multitudes of pills, potions, and preservatives, as they were
called, that they not only spent their money but even poisoned
themselves beforehand for fear of the poison of the infection; and
prepared their bodies for the plague, instead of preserving them against
it. On the other hand it is incredible and scarce to be imagined, how
the posts of houses and corners of streets were plastered over with
doctors' bills and papers of ignorant fellows, quacking and tampering in
physic, and inviting the people to come to them for remedies, which was
generally set off with such flourishes as these, viz.: 'Infallible
preventive pills against the plague.' 'Neverfailing preservatives
against the infection.' 'Sovereign cordials against the corruption of
the air.' 'Exact regulations for the conduct of the body in case of an
infection.' 'Anti-pestilential pills.' 'Incomparable drink against the
plague, never found out before.' 'An universal remedy for the plague.'
'The only true plague water.' 'The royal antidote against all kinds of
infection';--and such a number more that I cannot reckon up; and if I
could, would fill a book of themselves to set them down.

Others set up bills to summon people to their lodgings for directions
and advice in the case of infection. These had specious titles also,
such as these:--

'An eminent High Dutch physician, newly come over from Holland, where he
resided during all the time of the great plague last year in Amsterdam,
and cured multitudes of people that actually had the plague upon them.'

'An Italian gentlewoman just arrived from Naples, having a choice secret
to prevent infection, which she found out by her great experience, and
did wonderful cures with it in the late plague there, wherein there died
20,000 in one day.'

'An ancient gentlewoman, having practised with great success in the late
plague in this city, anno 1636, gives her advice only to the female sex.
To be spoken with,' &c.

'An experienced physician, who has long studied the doctrine of
antidotes against all sorts of poison and infection, has, after forty
years' practice, arrived to such skill as may, with God's blessing,
direct persons how to prevent their being touched by any contagious
distemper whatsoever. He directs the poor gratis.'

I take notice of these by way of specimen. I could give you two or three
dozen of the like and yet have abundance left behind. 'Tis sufficient
from these to apprise any one of the humour of those times, and how a
set of thieves and pickpockets not only robbed and cheated the poor
people of their money, but poisoned their bodies with odious and fatal
preparations; some with mercury, and some with other things as bad,
perfectly remote from the thing pretended to, and rather hurtful than
serviceable to the body in case an infection followed.

I cannot omit a subtility of one of those quack operators, with which he
gulled the poor people to crowd about him, but did nothing for them
without money. He had, it seems, added to his bills, which he gave about
the streets, this advertisement in capital letters, viz., 'He gives
advice to the poor for nothing.'

Abundance of poor people came to him accordingly, to whom he made a
great many fine speeches, examined them of the state of their health and
of the constitution of their bodies, and told them many good things for
them to do, which were of no great moment. But the issue and conclusion
of all was, that he had a preparation which if they took such a quantity
of every morning, he would pawn his life they should never have the
plague; no, though they lived in the house with people that were
infected. This made the people all resolve to have it; but then the
price of that was so much, I think 'twas half-a-crown. 'But, sir,' says
one poor woman, 'I am a poor almswoman and am kept by the parish, and
your bills say you give the poor your help for nothing.' 'Ay, good
woman,' says the doctor, 'so I do, as I published there. I give my
advice to the poor for nothing, but not my physic.' 'Alas, sir!' says
she, 'that is a snare laid for the poor, then; for you give them advice
for nothing; that is to say, you advise them gratis, to buy your physic
for their money; so does every shop-keeper with his wares.' Here the
woman began to give him ill words, and stood at his door all that day,
telling her tale to all the people that came, till the doctor finding
she turned away his customers, was obliged to call her upstairs again,
and give her his box of physic for nothing, which perhaps, too, was good
for nothing when she had it.

But to return to the people, whose confusions fitted them to be imposed
upon by all sorts of pretenders and by every mountebank. There is no
doubt but these quacking sort of fellows raised great gains out of the
miserable people, for we daily found the crowds that ran after them were
infinitely greater, and their doors were more thronged than those of Dr
Brooks, Dr Upton, Dr Hodges, Dr Berwick, or any, though the most famous
men of the time. And I was told that some of them got five pounds a day
by their physic.

But there was still another madness beyond all this, which may serve to
give an idea of the distracted humour of the poor people at that time:
and this was their following a worse sort of deceivers than any of
these; for these petty thieves only deluded them to pick their pockets
and get their money, in which their wickedness, whatever it was, lay
chiefly on the side of the deceivers, not upon the deceived. But in this
part I am going to mention, it lay chiefly in the people deceived, or
equally in both; and this was in wearing charms, philtres, exorcisms,
amulets, and I know not what preparations, to fortify the body with them
against the plague; as if the plague was not the hand of God, but a kind
of possession of an evil spirit, and that it was to be kept off with
crossings, signs of the zodiac, papers tied up with so many knots, and
certain words or figures written on them, as particularly the word
Abracadabra, formed in triangle or pyramid, thus:--


     ABRACADABRA
     ABRACADABR     Others had the Jesuits'
     ABRACADAB         mark in a cross:
     ABRACADA             I H
     ABRACAD               S.
     ABRACA
     ABRAC          Others nothing but this
     ABRA               mark, thus:
     ABR
     AB                   * *
     A                    {*}

I might spend a great deal of time in my exclamations against the
follies, and indeed the wickedness, of those things, in a time of such
danger, in a matter of such consequences as this, of a national
infection. But my memorandums of these things relate rather to take
notice only of the fact, and mention only that it was so. How the poor
people found the insufficiency of those things, and how many of them
were afterwards carried away in the dead-carts and thrown into the
common graves of every parish with these hellish charms and trumpery
hanging about their necks, remains to be spoken of as we go along.

All this was the effect of the hurry the people were in, after the first
notion of the plaque being at hand was among them, and which may be said
to be from about Michaelmas 1664, but more particularly after the two
men died in St Giles's in the beginning of December; and again, after
another alarm in February. For when the plague evidently spread itself,
they soon began to see the folly of trusting to those unperforming
creatures who had gulled them of their money; and then their fears
worked another way, namely, to amazement and stupidity, not knowing what
course to take or what to do either to help or relieve themselves. But
they ran about from one neighbour's house to another, and even in the
streets from one door to another, with repeated cries of, 'Lord, have
mercy upon us! What shall we do?'

Indeed, the poor people were to be pitied in one particular thing in
which they had little or no relief, and which I desire to mention with a
serious awe and reflection, which perhaps every one that reads this may
not relish; namely, that whereas death now began not, as we may say, to
hover over every one's head only, but to look into their houses and
chambers and stare in their faces. Though there might be some stupidity
and dulness of the mind (and there was so, a great deal), yet there was
a great deal of just alarm sounded into the very inmost soul, if I may
so say, of others. Many consciences were awakened; many hard hearts
melted into tears; many a penitent confession was made of crimes long
concealed. It would wound the soul of any Christian to have heard the
dying groans of many a despairing creature, and none durst come near to
comfort them. Many a robbery, many a murder, was then confessed aloud,
and nobody surviving to record the accounts of it. People might be
heard, even into the streets as we passed along, calling upon God for
mercy through Jesus Christ, and saying, 'I have been a thief, 'I have
been an adulterer', 'I have been a murderer', and the like, and none
durst stop to make the least inquiry into such things or to administer
comfort to the poor creatures that in the anguish both of soul and body
thus cried out. Some of the ministers did visit the sick at first and
for a little while, but it was not to be done. It would have been
present death to have gone into some houses. The very buriers of the
dead, who were the hardenedest creatures in town, were sometimes beaten
back and so terrified that they durst not go into houses where the whole
families were swept away together, and where the circumstances were more
particularly horrible, as some were; but this was, indeed, at the first
heat of the distemper.

Time inured them to it all, and they ventured everywhere afterwards
without hesitation, as I shall have occasion to mention at large
hereafter.

I am supposing now the plague to be begun, as I have said, and that the
magistrates began to take the condition of the people into their serious
consideration. What they did as to the regulation of the inhabitants and
of infected families, I shall speak to by itself; but as to the affair
of health, it is proper to mention it here that, having seen the foolish
humour of the people in running after quacks and mountebanks, wizards
and fortune-tellers, which they did as above, even to madness, the Lord
Mayor, a very sober and religious gentleman, appointed physicians and
surgeons for relief of the poor--I mean the diseased poor and in
particular ordered the College of Physicians to publish directions for
cheap remedies for the poor, in all the circumstances of the distemper.
This, indeed, was one of the most charitable and judicious things that
could be done at that time, for this drove the people from haunting the
doors of every disperser of bills, and from taking down blindly and
without consideration poison for physic and death instead of life.

This direction of the physicians was done by a consultation of the whole
College; and, as it was particularly calculated for the use of the poor
and for cheap medicines, it was made public, so that everybody might see
it, and copies were given gratis to all that desired it. But as it is
public, and to be seen on all occasions, I need not give the reader of
this the trouble of it.

I shall not be supposed to lessen the authority or capacity of the
physicians when I say that the violence of the distemper, when it came
to its extremity, was like the fire the next year. The fire, which
consumed what the plague could not touch, defied all the application of
remedies; the fire-engines were broken, the buckets thrown away, and the
power of man was baffled and brought to an end. So the Plague defied all
medicines; the very physicians were seized with it, with their
preservatives in their mouths; and men went about prescribing to others
and telling them what to do till the tokens were upon them, and they
dropped down dead, destroyed by that very enemy they directed others to
oppose. This was the case of several physicians, even some of them the
most eminent, and of several of the most skilful surgeons. Abundance of
quacks too died, who had the folly to trust to their own medicines,
which they must needs be conscious to themselves were good for nothing,
and who rather ought, like other sorts of thieves, to have run away,
sensible of their guilt, from the justice that they could not but expect
should punish them as they knew they had deserved.

Not that it is any derogation from the labour or application of the
physicians to say they fell in the common calamity; nor is it so
intended by me; it rather is to their praise that they ventured their
lives so far as even to lose them in the service of mankind. They
endeavoured to do good, and to save the lives of others. But we were not
to expect that the physicians could stop God's judgements, or prevent a
distemper eminently armed from heaven from executing the errand it was
sent about.

Doubtless, the physicians assisted many by their skill, and by their
prudence and applications, to the saving of their lives and restoring
their health. But it is not lessening their character or their skill, to
say they could not cure those that had the tokens upon them, or those
who were mortally infected before the physicians were sent for, as was
frequently the case.

It remains to mention now what public measures were taken by the
magistrates for the general safety, and to prevent the spreading of the
distemper, when it first broke out. I shall have frequent occasion to
speak of the prudence of the magistrates, their charity, their vigilance
for the poor, and for preserving good order, furnishing provisions, and
the like, when the plague was increased, as it afterwards was. But I am
now upon the order and regulations they published for the government of
infected families.

I mentioned above shutting of houses up; and it is needful to say
something particularly to that, for this part of the history of the
plague is very melancholy, but the most grievous story must be told.

About June the Lord Mayor of London and the Court of Aldermen, as I have
said, began more particularly to concern themselves for the regulation
of the city.

The justices of Peace for Middlesex, by direction of the Secretary of
State, had begun to shut up houses in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-
Fields, St Martin, St Clement Danes, &c., and it was with good success;
for in several streets where the plague broke out, upon strict guarding
the houses that were infected, and taking care to bury those that died
immediately after they were known to be dead, the plague ceased in those
streets. It was also observed that the plague decreased sooner in those
parishes after they had been visited to the full than it did in the
parishes of Bishopsgate, Shoreditch, Aldgate, Whitechappel, Stepney, and
others; the early care taken in that manner being a great means to the
putting a check to it.

This shutting up of houses was a method first taken, as I understand, in
the plague which happened in 1603, at the coming of King James the First
to the crown; and the power of shutting people up in their own houses
was granted by Act of Parliament, entitled, 'An Act for the charitable
Relief and Ordering of Persons infected with the Plague'; on which Act
of Parliament the Lord Mayor and aldermen of the city of London founded
the order they made at this time, and which took place the 1st of July
1665, when the numbers infected within the city were but few, the last
bill for the ninety-two parishes being but four; and some houses having
been shut up in the city, and some people being removed to the pest-
house beyond Bunhill Fields, in the way to Islington,--I say, by these
means, when there died near one thousand a week in the whole, the number
in the city was but twenty-eight, and the city was preserved more
healthy in proportion than any other place all the time of the
infection.

These orders of my Lord Mayor's were published, as I have said, the
latter end of June, and took place from the 1st of July, and were as
follows, viz.:--

ORDERS CONCEIVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE LORD MAYOR AND ALDERMEN OF THE
CITY OF LONDON CONCERNING THE INFECTION OF THE PLAGUE, 1665.

'WHEREAS in the reign of our late Sovereign King James, of happy memory,
an Act was made for the charitable relief and ordering of persons
infected with the plague, whereby authority was given to justices of the
peace, mayors, bailiffs, and other head-officers to appoint within their
several limits examiners, searchers, watchmen, keepers, and buriers for
the persons and places infected, and to minister unto them oaths for the
performance of their offices. And the same statute did also authorise
the giving of other directions, as unto them for the present necessity
should seem good in their directions. It is now, upon special
consideration, thought very expedient for preventing and avoiding of
infection of sickness (if it shall so please Almighty God) that these
officers following be appointed, and these orders hereafter duly
observed.

Examiners to be appointed in every Parish.

'First, it is thought requisite, and so ordered, that in every parish
there be one, two, or more persons of good sort and credit chosen and
appointed by the alderman, his deputy, and common council of every ward,
by the name of examiners, to continue in that office the space of two
months at least. And if any fit person so appointed shall refuse to
undertake the same, the said parties so refusing to be committed to
prison until they shall conform themselves accordingly.

The Examiner's Office.

'That these examiners be sworn by the aldermen to inquire and learn from
time to time what houses in every parish be visited, and what persons be
sick, and of what diseases, as near as they can inform themselves; and
upon doubt in that case, to command restraint of access until it appear
what the disease shall prove. And if they find any person sick of the
infection, to give order to the constable that the house be shut up; and
if the constable shall be found remiss or negligent, to give present
notice thereof to the alderman of the ward.

Watchmen.

'That to every infected house there be appointed two watchmen, one for
every day, and the other for the night; and that these watchmen have a
special care that no person go in or out of such infected houses whereof
they have the charge, upon pain of severe punishment. And the said
watchmen to do such further offices as the sick house shall need and
require: and if the watchman be sent upon any business, to lock up the
house and take the key with him; and the watchman by day to attend until
ten of the clock at night, and the watchman by night until six in the
morning.

Searchers.

'That there be a special care to appoint women searchers in every
parish, such as are of honest reputation, and of the best sort as can be
got in this kind; and these to be sworn to make due search and true
report to the utmost of their knowledge whether the persons whose bodies
they are appointed to search do die of the infection, or of what other
diseases, as near as they can. And that the physicians who shall be
appointed for cure and prevention of the infection do call before them
the said searchers who are, or shall be, appointed for the several
parishes under their respective cares, to the end they may consider
whether they are fitly qualified for that employment, and charge them
from time to time as they shall see cause, if they appear defective in
their duties.

'That no searcher during this time of visitation be permitted to use any
public work or employment, or keep any shop or stall, or be employed as
a laundress, or in any other common employment whatsoever.

Chirurgeons.

'For better assistance of the searchers, forasmuch as there hath been
heretofore great abuse in misreporting the disease, to the further
spreading of the infection, it is therefore ordered that there be chosen
and appointed able and discreet chirurgeons, besides those that do
already belong to the pest-house, amongst whom the city and Liberties to
be quartered as the places lie most apt and convenient; and every of
these to have one quarter for his limit; and the said chirurgeons in
every of their limits to join with the searchers for the view of the
body, to the end there may be a true report made of the disease.

'And further, that the said chirurgeons shall visit and search such-like
persons as shall either send for them or be named and directed unto them
by the examiners of every parish, and inform themselves of the disease
of the said parties.

'And forasmuch as the said chirurgeons are to be sequestered from all
other cures, and kept only to this disease of the infection, it is
ordered that every of the said chirurgeons shall have twelve-pence a
body searched by them, to be paid out of the goods of the party
searched, if he be able, or otherwise by the parish.

Nurse-keepers.

'If any nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any infected house
before twenty-eight days after the decease of any person dying of the
infection, the house to which the said nurse-keeper doth so remove
herself shall be shut up until the said twenty-eight days be expired.'

ORDERS CONCERNING INFECTED HOUSES AND PERSONS SICK OF THE PLAGUE.

Notice to be given of the Sickness.

'The master of every house, as soon as any one in his house complaineth,
either of blotch or purple, or swelling in any part of his body, or
falleth otherwise dangerously sick, without apparent cause of some other
disease, shall give knowledge thereof to the examiner of health within
two hours after the said sign shall appear.

Sequestration of the Sick.

'As soon as any man shall be found by this examiner, chirurgeon, or
searcher to be sick of the plague, he shall the same night be
sequestered in the same house; and in case he be so sequestered, then
though he afterwards die not, the house wherein he sickened should be
shut up for a month, after the use of the due preservatives taken by the
rest.

Airing the Stuff.

'For sequestration of the goods and stuff of the infection, their
bedding and apparel and hangings of chambers must be well aired with
fire and such perfumes as are requisite within the infected house before
they be taken again to use. This to be done by the appointment of an
examiner.

Shutting up of the House.

'If any person shall have visited any man known to be infected of the
plague, or entered willingly into any known infected house, being not
allowed, the house wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up for certain
days by the examiner's direction.

None to be removed out of infected Houses, but, &C.

'Item, that none be removed out of the house where he falleth sick of
the infection into any other house in the city (except it be to the
pest-house or a tent, or unto some such house which the owner of the
said visited house holdeth in his own hands and occupieth by his own
servants); and so as security be given to the parish whither such remove
is made, that the attendance and charge about the said visited persons
shall be observed and charged in all the particularities before
expressed, without any cost of that parish to which any such remove
shall happen to be made, and this remove to be done by night. And it
shall be lawful to any person that hath two houses to remove either his
sound or his infected people to his spare house at his choice, so as, if
he send away first his sound, he not after send thither his sick, nor
again unto the sick the sound; and that the same which he sendeth be for
one week at the least shut up and secluded from company, for fear of
some infection at the first not appearing.

Burial of the Dead.

'That the burial of the dead by this visitation be at most convenient
hours, always either before sun-rising or after sun-setting, with the
privity of the churchwardens or constable, and not otherwise; and that
no neighbours nor friends be suffered to accompany the corpse to church,
or to enter the house visited, upon pain of having his house shut up or
be imprisoned.

'And that no corpse dying of infection shall be buried, or remain in any
church in time of common prayer, sermon, or lecture. And that no
children be suffered at time of burial of any corpse in any church,
churchyard, or burying-place to come near the corpse, coffin, or grave.
And that all the graves shall be at least six feet deep.

'And further, all public assemblies at other burials are to be foreborne
during the continuance of this visitation.

No infected Stuff to be uttered.

'That no clothes, stuff, bedding, or garments be suffered to be carried
or conveyed out of any infected houses, and that the criers and carriers
abroad of bedding or old apparel to be sold or pawned be utterly
prohibited and restrained, and no brokers of bedding or old apparel be
permitted to make any outward show, or hang forth on their stalls, shop-
boards, or windows, towards any street, lane, common way, or passage,
any old bedding or apparel to be sold, upon pain of imprisonment. And if
any broker or other person shall buy any bedding, apparel, or other
stuff out of any infected house within two months after the infection
hath been there, his house shall be shut up as infected, and so shall
continue shut up twenty days at the least.

No Person to be conveyed out of any infected House.

'If any person visited do fortune, by negligent looking unto, or by any
other means, to come or be conveyed from a place infected to any other
place, the parish from whence such party hath come or been conveyed,
upon notice thereof given, shall at their charge cause the said party so
visited and escaped to be carried and brought back again by night, and
the parties in this case offending to be punished at the direction of
the alderman of the ward, and the house of the receiver of such visited
person to be shut up for twenty days.

Every visited House to be marked.

'That every house visited be marked with a red cross of a foot long in
the middle of the door, evident to be seen, and with these usual printed
words, that is to say, "Lord, have mercy upon us," to be set close over
the same cross, there to continue until lawful opening of the same
house.

Every visited House to be watched.

'That the constables see every house shut up, and to be attended with
watchmen, which may keep them in, and minister necessaries unto them at
their own charges, if they be able, or at the common charge, if they are
unable; the shutting up to be for the space of four weeks after all be
whole.

'That precise order to be taken that the searchers, chirurgeons,
keepers, and buriers are not to pass the streets without holding a red
rod or wand of three feet in length in their hands, open and evident to
be seen, and are not to go into any other house than into their own, or
into that whereunto they are directed or sent for; but to forbear and
abstain from company, especially when they have been lately used in any
such business or attendance.

Inmates.

'That where several inmates are in one and the same house, and any
person in that house happens to be infected, no other person or family
of such house shall be suffered to remove him or themselves without a
certificate from the examiners of health of that parish; or in default
thereof, the house whither he or they so remove shall be shut up as in
case of visitation.

Hackney-Coaches.

'That care be taken of hackney-coachmen, that they may not (as some of
them have been observed to do after carrying of infected persons to the
pest-house and other places) be admitted to common use till their
coaches be well aired, and have stood unemployed by the space of five or
six days after such service.'

ORDERS FOR CLEANSING AND KEEPING OF THE STREETS SWEPT.

The Streets to be kept Clean.

'First, it is thought necessary, and so ordered, that every householder
do cause the street to be daily prepared before his door, and so to keep
it clean swept all the week long.

That Rakers take it from out the Houses.

'That the sweeping and filth of houses be daily carried away by the
rakers, and that the raker shall give notice of his coming by the
blowing of a horn, as hitherto hath been done.

Laystalls to be made far off from the City.

'That the laystalls be removed as far as may be out of the city and
common passages, and that no nightman or other be suffered to empty a
vault into any garden near about the city.

Care to be had of unwholesome Fish or Flesh, and of musty Corn.

'That special care be taken that no stinking fish, or unwholesome flesh,
or musty corn, or other corrupt fruits of what sort soever, be suffered
to be sold about the city, or any part of the same.

'That the brewers and tippling-houses be looked into for musty and
unwholesome casks.

'That no hogs, dogs, or cats, or tame pigeons, or ponies, be suffered to
be kept within any part of the city, or any swine to be or stray in the
streets or lanes, but that such swine be impounded by the beadle or any
other officer, and the owner punished according to Act of Common
Council, and that the dogs be killed by the dog-killers appointed for
that purpose.'

ORDERS CONCERNING LOOSE PERSONS AND IDLE ASSEMBLIES.

Beggars.

'Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of than the multitude of rogues
and wandering beggars that swarm in every place about the city, being a
great cause of the spreading of the infection, and will not be avoided,
notwithstanding any orders that have been given to the contrary: It is
therefore now ordered, that such constables, and others whom this matter
may any way concern, take special care that no wandering beggars be
suffered in the streets of this city in any fashion or manner
whatsoever, upon the penalty provided by the law, to be duly and
severely executed upon them.

Plays.

'That all plays, bear-baitings, games, singing of ballads, buckler-play,
or such-like causes of assemblies of people be utterly prohibited, and
the parties offending severely punished by every alderman in his ward.

Feasting prohibited.

'That all public feasting, and particularly by the companies of this
city, and dinners at taverns, ale-houses, and other places of common
entertainment, be forborne till further order and allowance; and that
the money thereby spared be preserved and employed for the benefit and
relief of the poor visited with the infection.

Tippling-houses.

'That disorderly tippling in taverns, ale-houses, coffee-houses, and
cellars be severely looked unto, as the common sin of this time and
greatest occasion of dispersing the plague. And that no company or
person be suffered to remain or come into any tavern, ale-house, or
coffee-house to drink after nine of the clock in the evening, according
to the ancient law and custom of this city, upon the penalties ordained
in that behalf.

'And for the better execution of these orders, and such other rules and
directions as, upon further consideration, shall be found needful: It is
ordered and enjoined that the aldermen, deputies, and common councilmen
shall meet together weekly, once, twice, thrice or oftener (as cause
shall require), at some one general place accustomed in their respective
wards (being clear from infection of the plague), to consult how the
said orders may be duly put in execution; not intending that any
dwelling in or near places infected shall come to the said meeting while
their coming may be doubtful. And the said aldermen, and deputies, and
common councilmen in their several wards may put in execution any other
good orders that by them at their said meetings shall be conceived and
devised for preservation of his Majesty's subjects from the infection.

    'SIR JOHN LAWRENCE, Lord Mayor.
    SIR GEORGE WATERMAN
    SIR CHARLES DOE, Sheriffs.'

I need not say that these orders extended only to such places as were
within the Lord Mayor's jurisdiction, so it is requisite to observe that
the justices of Peace within those parishes and places as were called
the Hamlets and out-parts took the same method. As I remember, the
orders for shutting up of houses did not take Place so soon on our side,
because, as I said before, the plague did not reach to these eastern
parts of the town at least, nor begin to be very violent, till the
beginning of August. For example, the whole bill from the 11th to the
18th of July was 1761, yet there died but 71 of the plague in all those
parishes we call the Tower Hamlets, and they were as follows:--


     -                           The next week   And to the 1st
     -                             was thus:     of Aug. thus:
     Aldgate               14          34               65
     Stepney               33          58               76
     Whitechappel          21          48               79
     St Katherine, Tower    2           4                4
     Trinity, Minories      1           1                4
     -                    ---         ---              ---
     -                     71         145              228

It was indeed coming on amain, for the burials that same week were in
the next adjoining parishes thus:--


     -                                The next week
     -                                prodigiously    To the 1st of
     -                                increased, as:   Aug. thus:
     St Leonard's, Shoreditch      64       84          110
     St Botolph's, Bishopsgate     65      105          116
     St Giles's, Cripplegate      213      421          554
     -                            ---      ---          ---
     -                            342      610          780

This shutting up of houses was at first counted a very cruel and
unchristian method, and the poor people so confined made bitter
lamentations. Complaints of the severity of it were also daily brought
to my Lord Mayor, of houses causelessly (and some maliciously) shut up.
I cannot say; but upon inquiry many that complained so loudly were found
in a condition to be continued; and others again, inspection being made
upon the sick person, and the sickness not appearing infectious, or if
uncertain, yet on his being content to be carried to the pest-house,
were released.

It is true that the locking up the doors of people's houses, and setting
a watchman there night and day to prevent their stirring out or any
coming to them, when perhaps the sound people in the family might have
escaped if they had been removed from the sick, looked very hard and
cruel; and many people perished in these miserable confinements which,
'tis reasonable to believe, would not have been distempered if they had
had liberty, though the plague was in the house; at which the people
were very clamorous and uneasy at first, and several violences were
committed and injuries offered to the men who were set to watch the
houses so shut up; also several people broke out by force in many
places, as I shall observe by-and-by. But it was a public good that
justified the private mischief, and there was no obtaining the least
mitigation by any application to magistrates or government at that time,
at least not that I heard of. This put the people upon all manner of
stratagem in order, if possible, to get out; and it would fill a little
volume to set down the arts used by the people of such houses to shut
the eyes of the watchmen who were employed, to deceive them, and to
escape or break out from them, in which frequent scuffles and some
mischief happened; of which by itself.

As I went along Houndsditch one morning about eight o'clock there was a
great noise. It is true, indeed, there was not much crowd, because
people were not very free to gather together, or to stay long together
when they were there; nor did I stay long there. But the outcry was loud
enough to prompt my curiosity, and I called to one that looked out of a
window, and asked what was the matter.

A watchman, it seems, had been employed to keep his post at the door of
a house which was infected, or said to be infected, and was shut up. He
had been there all night for two nights together, as he told his story,
and the day-watchman had been there one day, and was now come to relieve
him. All this while no noise had been heard in the house, no light had
been seen; they called for nothing, sent him of no errands, which used
to be the chief business of the watchmen; neither had they given him any
disturbance, as he said, from the Monday afternoon, when he heard great
crying and screaming in the house, which, as he supposed, was occasioned
by some of the family dying just at that time. It seems, the night
before, the dead-cart, as it was called, had been stopped there, and a
servant-maid had been brought down to the door dead, and the buriers or
bearers, as they were called, put her into the cart, wrapt only in a
green rug, and carried her away.

The watchman had knocked at the door, it seems, when he heard that noise
and crying, as above, and nobody answered a great while; but at last one
looked out and said with an angry, quick tone, and yet a kind of crying
voice, or a voice of one that was crying, 'What d'ye want, that ye make
such a knocking?' He answered, 'I am the watchman! How do you do? What
is the matter?' The person answered, 'What is that to you? Stop the
dead-cart.' This, it seems, was about one o'clock. Soon after, as the
fellow said, he stopped the dead-cart, and then knocked again, but
nobody answered. He continued knocking, and the bellman called out
several times, 'Bring out your dead'; but nobody answered, till the man
that drove the cart, being called to other houses, would stay no longer,
and drove away.

The watchman knew not what to make of all this, so he let them alone
till the morning-man or day-watchman, as they called him, came to
relieve him. Giving him an account of the particulars, they knocked at
the door a great while, but nobody answered; and they observed that the
window or casement at which the person had looked out who had answered
before continued open, being up two pair of stairs.

Upon this the two men, to satisfy their curiosity, got a long ladder,
and one of them went up to the window and looked into the room, where he
saw a woman lying dead upon the floor in a dismal manner, having no
clothes on her but her shift. But though he called aloud, and putting in
his long staff, knocked hard on the floor, yet nobody stirred or
answered; neither could he hear any noise in the house.

He came down again upon this, and acquainted his fellow, who went up
also; and finding it just so, they resolved to acquaint either the Lord
Mayor or some other magistrate of it, but did not offer to go in at the
window. The magistrate, it seems, upon the information of the two men,
ordered the house to be broke open, a constable and other persons being
appointed to be present, that nothing might be plundered; and
accordingly it was so done, when nobody was found in the house but that
young woman, who having been hat there died two thousand to three or four thousand a week was
sufficient to alarm the whole trading part of the world; and the
following time, being so dreadful also in the very city itself, put the
whole world, I say, upon their guard against it.

You may be sure, also, that the report of these things lost nothing in
the carriage. The plague was itself very terrible, and the distress of
the people very great, as you may observe of what I have said. But the
rumour was infinitely greater, and it must not be wondered that our
friends abroad (as my brother's correspondents in particular were told
there, namely, in Portugal and Italy, where he chiefly traded) [said]
that in London there died twenty thousand in a week; that the dead
bodies lay unburied by heaps; that the living were not sufficient to
bury the dead or the sound to look after the sick; that all the kingdom
was infected likewise, so that it was an universal malady such as was
never heard of in those parts of the world; and they could hardly
believe us when we gave them an account how things really were, and how
there was not above one-tenth part of the people dead; that there was
500,000, left that lived all the time in the town; that now the people
began to walk the streets again, and those who were fled to return,
there was no miss of the usual throng of people in the streets, except
as every family might miss their relations and neighbours, and the like.
I say they could not believe these things; and if inquiry were now to be
made in Naples, or in other cities on the coast of Italy, they would
tell you that there was a dreadful infection in London so many years
ago, in which, as above, there died twenty thousand in a week, &c., just
as we have had it reported in London that there was a plague in the city
of Naples in the year 1656, in which there died 20,000 people in a day,
of which I have had very good satisfaction that it was utterly false.

But these extravagant reports were very prejudicial to our trade, as
well as unjust and injurious in themselves, for it was a long time after
the plague was quite over before our trade could recover itself in those
parts of the world; and the Flemings and Dutch (but especially the last)
made very great advantages of it, having all the market to themselves,
and even buying our manufactures in several parts of England where the
plague was not, and carrying them to Holland and Flanders, and from
thence transporting them to Spain and to Italy as if they had been of
their own making.

But they were detected sometimes and punished: that is to say, their
goods confiscated and ships also; for if it was true that our
manufactures as well as our people were infected, and that it was
dangerous to touch or to open and receive the smell of them, then those
people ran the hazard by that clandestine trade not only of carrying the
contagion into their own country, but also of infecting the nations to
whom they traded with those goods; which, considering how many lives
might be lost in consequence of such an action, must be a trade that no
men of conscience could suffer themselves to be concerned in.

I do not take upon me to say that any harm was done, I mean of that
kind, by those people. But I doubt I need not make any such proviso in
the case of our own country; for either by our people of London, or by
the commerce which made their conversing with all sorts of people in
every country and of every considerable town necessary, I say, by this
means the plague was first or last spread all over the kingdom, as well
in London as in all the cities and great towns, especially in the
trading manufacturing towns and seaports; so that, first or last, all
the considerable places in England were visited more or less, and the
kingdom of Ireland in some places, but not so universally. How it fared
with the people in Scotland I had no opportunity to inquire.

It is to be observed that while the plague continued so violent in
London, the outports, as they are called, enjoyed a very great trade,
especially to the adjacent countries and to our own plantations. For
example, the towns of Colchester, Yarmouth, and Hun, on that side of
England, exported to Holland and Hamburg the manufactures of the
adjacent countries for several months after the trade with London was,
as it were, entirely shut up; likewise the cities of Bristol and Exeter,
with the port of Plymouth, had the like advantage to Spain, to the
Canaries, to Guinea, and to the West Indies, and particularly to
Ireland; but as the plague spread itself every way after it had been in
London to such a degree as it was in August and September, so all or
most of those cities and towns were infected first or last; and then
trade was, as it were, under a general embargo or at a full stop--as I
shall observe further when I speak of our home trade.

One thing, however, must be observed: that as to ships coming in from
abroad (as many, you may be sure, did) some who were out in all parts of
the world a considerable while before, and some who when they went out
knew nothing of an infection, or at least of one so terrible--these came
up the river boldly, and delivered their cargoes as they were obliged to
do, except just in the two months of August and September, when the
weight of the infection lying, as I may say, all below Bridge, nobody
durst appear in business for a while. But as this continued but for a
few weeks, the homeward-bound ships, especially such whose cargoes were
not liable to spoil, came to an anchor for a time short of the Pool,* or
fresh-water part of the river, even as low as the river Medway, where
several of them ran in; and others lay at the Nore, and in the Hope
below Gravesend. So that by the latter end of October there was a very
great fleet of homeward-bound ships to come up, such as the like had not
been known for many years.


     * That part of the river where the ships lie up when they
     come home is called the Pool, and takes in all the river on
     both sides of the water, from the Tower to Cuckold's Point
     and Limehouse. [Footnote in the original.]

Two particular trades were carried on by water-carriage all the while of
the infection, and that with little or no interruption, very much to the
advantage and comfort of the poor distressed people of the city: and
those were the coasting trade for corn and the Newcastle trade for
coals.

The first of these was particularly carried on by small vessels from the
port of Hull and other places on the Humber, by which great quantities
of corn were brought in from Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The other part
of this corn-trade was from Lynn, in Norfolk, from Wells and Burnham,
and from Yarmouth, all in the same county; and the third branch was from
the river Medway, and from Milton, Feversham, Margate, and Sandwich, and
all the other little places and ports round the coast of Kent and Essex.

There was also a very good trade from the coast of Suffolk with corn,
butter, and cheese; these vessels kept a constant course of trade, and
without interruption came up to that market known still by the name of
Bear Key, where they supplied the city plentifully with corn when land-
carriage began to fail, and when the people began to be sick of coming
from many places in the country.

This also was much of it owing to the prudence and conduct of the Lord
Mayor, who took such care to keep the masters and seamen from danger
when they came up, causing their corn to be bought off at any time they
wanted a market (which, however, was very seldom), and causing the corn-
factors immediately to unlade and deliver the vessels loaden with corn,
that they had very little occasion to come out of their ships or
vessels, the money being always carried on board to them and put into a
pail of vinegar before it was carried.

The second trade was that of coals from Newcastle-upon-Tyne, without
which the city would have been greatly distressed; for not in the
streets only, but in private houses and families, great quantities of
coals were then burnt, even all the summer long and when the weather was
hottest, which was done by the advice of the physicians. Some indeed
opposed it, and insisted that to keep the houses and rooms hot was a
means to propagate the temper, which was a fermentation and heat already
in the blood; that it was known to spread and increase in hot weather
and abate in cold; and therefore they alleged that all contagious
distempers are the worse for heat, because the contagion was nourished
and gained strength in hot weather, and was, as it were, propagated in
heat.

Others said they granted that heat in the climate might propagate
infection--as sultry, hot weather fills the air with vermin and
nourishes innumerable numbers and kinds of venomous creatures which
breed in our food, in the plants, and even in our bodies, by the very
stench of which infection may be propagated; also that heat in the air,
or heat of weather, as we ordinarily call it, makes bodies relax and
faint, exhausts the spirits, opens the pores, and makes us more apt to
receive infection, or any evil influence, be it from noxious
pestilential vapours or any other thing in the air; but that the heat of
fire, and especially of coal fires kept in our houses, or near us, had a
quite different operation; the heat being not of the same kind, but
quick and fierce, tending not to nourish but to consume and dissipate
all those noxious fumes which the other kind of heat rather exhaled and
stagnated than separated and burnt up. Besides, it was alleged that the
sulphurous and nitrous particles that are often found to be in the coal,
with that bituminous substance which burns, are all assisting to clear
and purge the air, and render it wholesome and safe to breathe in after
the noxious particles, as above, are dispersed and burnt up.

The latter opinion prevailed at that time, and, as I must confess, I
think with good reason; and the experience of the citizens confirmed it,
many houses which had constant fires kept in the rooms having never been
infected at all; and I must join my experience to it, for I found the
keeping good fires kept our rooms sweet and wholesome, and I do verily
believe made our whole family so, more than would otherwise have been.

But I return to the coals as a trade. It was with no little difficulty
that this trade was kept open, and particularly because, as we were in
an open war with the Dutch at that time, the Dutch capers at first
took a great many of our collier-ships, which made the rest cautious,
and made them to stay to come in fleets together. But after some time
the capers were either afraid to take them, or their masters, the
States, were afraid they should, and forbade them, lest the plague
should be among them, which made them fare the better.

For the security of those northern traders, the coal-ships were ordered
by my Lord Mayor not to come up into the Pool above a certain number at
a time, and ordered lighters and other vessels such as the woodmongers
(that is, the wharf-keepers or coal-sellers) furnished, to go down and
take out the coals as low as Deptford and Greenwich, and some farther
down.

Others delivered great quantities of coals in particular places where
the ships could come to the shore, as at Greenwich, Blackwall, and other
places, in vast heaps, as if to be kept for sale; but were then fetched
away after the ships which brought them were gone, so that the seamen
had no communication with the river-men, nor so much as came near one
another.

Yet all this caution could not effectually prevent the distemper getting
among the colliery: that is to say among the ships, by which a great
many seamen died of it; and that which was still worse was, that they
carried it down to Ipswich and Yarmouth, to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and
other places on the coast--where, especially at Newcastle and at
Sunderland, it carried off a great number of people.

The making so many fires, as above, did indeed consume an unusual
quantity of coals; and that upon one or two stops of the ships coming
up, whether by contrary weather or by the interruption of enemies I do
not remember, but the price of coals was exceeding dear, even as high as
4 a chalder; but it soon abated when the ships came in, and as
afterwards they had a freer passage, the price was very reasonable all
the rest of that year.

The public fires which were made on these occasions, as I have
calculated it, must necessarily have cost the city about 200 chalders of
coals a week, if they had continued, which was indeed a very great
quantity; but as it was thought necessary, nothing was spared. However,
as some of the physicians cried them down, they were not kept alight
above four or five days. The fires were ordered thus:--

One at the Custom House, one at Billingsgate, one at Queenhith, and one
at the Three Cranes; one in Blackfriars, and one at the gate of
Bridewell; one at the corner of Leadenhal Street and Gracechurch; one at
the north and one at the south gate of the Royal Exchange; one at Guild
Hall, and one at Blackwell Hall gate; one at the Lord Mayor's door in St
Helen's, one at the west entrance into St Paul's, and one at the
entrance into Bow Church. I do not remember whether there was any at the
city gates, but one at the Bridge-foot there was, just by St Magnus
Church.

I know some have quarrelled since that at the experiment, and said that
there died the more people because of those fires; but I am persuaded
those that say so offer no evidence to prove it, neither can I believe
it on any account whatever.

It remains to give some account of the state of trade at home in England
during this dreadful time, and particularly as it relates to the
manufactures and the trade in the city. At the first breaking out of the
infection there was, as it is easy to suppose, a very great fright among
the people, and consequently a general stop of trade, except in
provisions and necessaries of life; and even in those things, as there
was a vast number of people fled and a very great number always sick,
besides the number which died, so there could not be above two-thirds,
if above one-half, of the consumption of provisions in the city as used
to be.

It pleased God to send a very plentiful year of corn and fruit, but not
of hay or grass--by which means bread was cheap, by reason of the plenty
of corn. Flesh was cheap, by reason of the scarcity of grass; but butter
and cheese were dear for the same reason, and hay in the market just
beyond Whitechappel Bars was sold at 4 pound per load. But that affected
not the poor. There was a most excessive plenty of all sorts of fruit,
such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, and they were the
cheaper because of the want of people; but this made the poor eat them
to excess, and this brought them into fluxes, griping of the guts,
surfeits, and the like, which often precipitated them into the plague.

But to come to matters of trade. First, foreign exportation being
stopped or at least very much interrupted and rendered difficult, a
general stop of all those manufactures followed of course which were
usually brought for exportation; and though sometimes merchants abroad
were importunate for goods, yet little was sent, the passages being so
generally stopped that the English ships would not be admitted, as is
said already, into their port.

This put a stop to the manufactures that were for exportation in most
parts of England, except in some out-ports; and even that was soon
stopped, for they all had the plague in their turn. But though this was
felt all over England, yet, what was still worse, all intercourse of
trade for home consumption of manufactures, especially those which
usually circulated through the Londoner's hands, was stopped at once,
the trade of the city being stopped.

All kinds of handicrafts in the city, &c., tradesmen and mechanics,
were, as I have said before, out of employ; and this occasioned the
putting-off and dismissing an innumerable number of journeymen and
workmen of all sorts, seeing nothing was done relating to such trades
but what might be said to be absolutely necessary.

This caused the multitude of single people in London to be unprovided
for, as also families whose living depended upon the labour of the heads
of those families; I say, this reduced them to extreme misery; and I
must confess it is for the honour of the city of London, and will be for
many ages, as long as this is to be spoken of, that they were able to
supply with charitable provision the wants of so many thousands of those
as afterwards fell sick and were distressed: so that it may be safely
averred that nobody perished for want, at least that the magistrates had
any notice given them of.

This stagnation of our manufacturing trade in the country would have put
the people there to much greater difficulties, but that the master-
workmen, clothiers and others, to the uttermost of their stocks and
strength, kept on making their goods to keep the poor at work, believing
that soon as the sickness should abate they would have a quick demand in
proportion to the decay of their trade at that time. But as none but
those masters that were rich could do thus, and that many were poor and
not able, the manufacturing trade in England suffered greatly, and the
poor were pinched all over England by the calamity of the city of London
only.

It is true that the next year made them full amends by another terrible
calamity upon the city; so that the city by one calamity impoverished
and weakened the country, and by another calamity, even terrible too of
its kind, enriched the country and made them again amends; for an
infinite quantity of household Stuff, wearing apparel, and other things,
besides whole warehouses filled with merchandise and manufactures such
as come from all parts of England, were consumed in the fire of London
the next year after this terrible visitation. It is incredible what a
trade this made all over the whole kingdom, to make good the want and to
supply that loss; so that, in short, all the manufacturing hands in the
nation were set on work, and were little enough for several years to
supply the market and answer the demands. All foreign markets also were
empty of our goods by the stop which had been occasioned by the plague,
and before an open trade was allowed again; and the prodigious demand at
home falling in, joined to make a quick vent for all sort of goods; so
that there never was known such a trade all over England for the time as
was in the first seven years after the plague, and after the fire of
London.

It remains now that I should say something of the merciful part of this
terrible judgement. The last week in September, the plague being come to
its crisis, its fury began to assuage. I remember my friend Dr Heath,
coming to see me the week before, told me he was sure that the violence
of it would assuage in a few days; but when I saw the weekly bill of
that week, which was the highest of the whole year, being 8297 of all
diseases, I upbraided him with it, and asked him what he had made his
judgement from. His answer, however, was not so much to seek as I
thought it would have been. 'Look you,' says he, 'by the number which
are at this time sick and infected, there should have been twenty
thousand dead the last week instead of eight thousand, if the inveterate
mortal contagion had been as it was two weeks ago; for then it
ordinarily killed in two or three days, now not under eight or ten; and
then not above one in five recovered, whereas I have observed that now
not above two in five miscarry. And, observe it from me, the next bill
will decrease, and you will see many more people recover than used to
do; for though a vast multitude are now everywhere infected, and as many
every day fall sick, yet there will not so many die as there did, for
the malignity of the distemper is abated';--adding that he began now to
hope, nay, more than hope, that the infection had passed its crisis and
was going off; and accordingly so it was, for the next week being, as I
said, the last in September, the bill decreased almost two thousand.

It is true the plague was still at a frightful height, and the next bill
was no less than 6460, and the next to that, 5720; but still my friend's
observation was just, and it did appear the people did recover faster
and more in number than they used to do; and indeed, if it had not been
so, what had been the condition of the city of London? For, according to
my friend, there were not fewer than 60,000 people at that time
infected, whereof, as above, 20,477 died, and near 40,000 recovered;
whereas, had it been as it was before, 50,000 of that number would very
probably have died, if not more, and 50,000 more would have sickened;
for, in a word, the whole mass of people began to sicken, and it looked
as if none would escape.

But this remark of my friend's appeared more evident in a few weeks
more, for the decrease went on, and another week in October it decreased
1843, so that the number dead of the plague was but 2665; and the next
week it decreased 1413 more, and yet it was seen plainly that there was
abundance of people sick, nay, abundance more than ordinary, and
abundance fell sick every day but (as above) the malignity of the
disease abated.

Such is the precipitant disposition of our people (whether it is so or
not all over the world, that's none of my particular business to
inquire), but I saw it apparently here, that as upon the first fright of
the infection they shunned one another, and fled from one another's
houses and from the city with an unaccountable and, as I thought,
unnecessary fright, so now, upon this notion spreading, viz., that the
distemper was not so catching as formerly, and that if it was catched it
was not so mortal, and seeing abundance of people who really fell sick
recover again daily, they took to such a precipitant courage, and grew
so entirely regardless of themselves and of the infection, that they
made no more of the plague than of an ordinary fever, nor indeed so
much. They not only went boldly into company with those who had tumours
and carbuncles upon them that were running, and consequently contagious,
but ate and drank with them, nay, into their houses to visit them, and
even, as I was told, into their very chambers where they lay sick.

This I could not see rational. My friend Dr Heath allowed, and it was
plain to experience, that the distemper was as catching as ever, and as
many fell sick, but only he alleged that so many of those that fell sick
did not die; but I think that while many did die, and that at best the
distemper itself was very terrible, the sores and swellings very
tormenting, and the danger of death not left out of the circumstances of
sickness, though not so frequent as before; all those things, together
with the exceeding tediousness of the cure, the loathsomeness of the
disease, and many other articles, were enough to deter any man living
from a dangerous mixture with the sick people, and make them as anxious
almost to avoid the infections as before.

Nay, there was another thing which made the mere catching of the
distemper frightful, and that was the terrible burning of the caustics
which the surgeons laid on the swellings to bring them to break and to
run, without which the danger of death was very great, even to the last.
Also, the insufferable torment of the swellings, which, though it might
not make people raving and distracted, as they were before, and as I
have given several instances of already, yet they put the patient to
inexpressible torment; and those that fell into it, though they did
escape with life, yet they made bitter complaints of those that had told
them there was no danger, and sadly repented their rashness and folly in
venturing to run into the reach of it.

Nor did this unwary conduct of the people end here, for a great many
that thus cast off their cautions suffered more deeply still, and though
many escaped, yet many died; and at least it had this public mischief
attending it, that it made the decrease of burials slower than it would
otherwise have been. For as this notion ran like lightning through the
city, and people's heads were possessed with it, even as soon as the
first great decrease in the bills appeared, we found that the two next
bills did not decrease in proportion; the reason I take to be the
people's running so rashly into danger, giving up all their former
cautions and care, and all the shyness which they used to practise,
depending that the sickness would not reach them--or that if it did,
they should not die.

The physicians opposed this thoughtless humour of the people with all
their might, and gave out printed directions, spreading them all over
the city and suburbs, advising the people to continue reserved, and to
use still the utmost caution in their ordinary conduct, notwithstanding
the decrease of the distemper, terrifying them with the danger of
bringing a relapse upon the whole city, and telling them how such a
relapse might be more fatal and dangerous than the whole visitation that
had been already; with many arguments and reasons to explain and prove
that part to them, and which are too long to repeat here.

But it was all to no purpose; the audacious creatures were so possessed
with the first joy and so surprised with the satisfaction of seeing a
vast decrease in the weekly bills, that they were impenetrable by any
new terrors, and would not be persuaded but that the bitterness of death
was past; and it was to no more purpose to talk to them than to an east
wind; but they opened shops, went about streets, did business, and
conversed with anybody that came in their way to converse with, whether
with business or without, neither inquiring of their health or so much
as being apprehensive of any danger from them, though they knew them not
to be sound.

This imprudent, rash conduct cost a great many their lives who had with
great care and caution shut themselves up and kept retired, as it were,
from all mankind, and had by that means, under God's providence, been
preserved through all the heat of that infection.

This rash and foolish conduct, I say, of the people went so far that the
ministers took notice to them of it at last, and laid before them both
the folly and danger of it; and this checked it a little, so that they
grew more cautious. But it had another effect, which they could not
check; for as the first rumour had spread not over the city only, but
into the country, it had the like effect: and the people were so tired
with being so long from London, and so eager to come back, that they
flocked to town without fear or forecast, and began to show themselves
in the streets as if all the danger was over. It was indeed surprising
to see it, for though there died still from 1000 to 1800 a week, yet the
people flocked to town as if all had been well.

The consequence of this was, that the bills increased again 400 the very
first week in November; and if I might believe the physicians, there was
above 3000 fell sick that week, most of them new-comers, too.

One John Cock, a barber in St Martin's-le-Grand, was an eminent example
of this; I mean of the hasty return of the people when the plague was
abated. This John Cock had left the town with his whole family, and
locked up his house, and was gone in the country, as many others did;
and finding the plague so decreased in November that there died but 905
per week of all diseases, he ventured home again. He had in his family
ten persons; that is to say, himself and wife, five children, two
apprentices, and a maid-servant. He had not returned to his house above
a week, and began to open his shop and carry on his trade, but the
distemper broke out in his family, and within about five days they all
died, except one; that is to say, himself, his wife, all his five
children, and his two apprentices; and only the maid remained alive.

But the mercy of God was greater to the rest than we had reason to
expect; for the malignity (as I have said) of the distemper was spent,
the contagion was exhausted, and also the winter weather came on apace,
and the air was clear and cold, with sharp frosts; and this increasing
still, most of those that had fallen sick recovered, and the health of
the city began to return. There were indeed some returns of the
distemper even in the month of December, and the bills increased near a
hundred; but it went off again, and so in a short while things began to
return to their own channel. And wonderful it was to see how populous
the city was again all on a sudden, so that a stranger could not miss
the numbers that were lost. Neither was there any miss of the
inhabitants as to their dwellings--few or no empty houses were to be
seen, or if there were some, there was no want of tenants for them.

I wish I could say that as the city had a new face, so the manners of
the people had a new appearance. I doubt not but there were many that
retained a sincere sense of their deliverance, and were that heartily
thankful to that Sovereign Hand that had protected them in so dangerous
a time; it would be very uncharitable to judge otherwise in a city so
populous, and where the people were so devout as they were here in the
time of the visitation itself; but except what of this was to be found
in particular families and faces, it must be acknowledged that the
general practice of the people was just as it was before, and very
little difference was to be seen.

Some, indeed, said things were worse; that the morals of the people
declined from this very time; that the people, hardened by the danger
they had been in, like seamen after a storm is over, were more wicked
and more stupid, more bold and hardened, in their vices and immoralities
than they were before; but I will not carry it so far neither. It would
take up a history of no small length to give a particular of all the
gradations by which the course of things in this city came to be
restored again, and to run in their own channel as they did before.

Some parts of England were now infected as violently as London had been;
the cities of Norwich, Peterborough, Lincoln, Colchester, and other
places were now visited; and the magistrates of London began to set
rules for our conduct as to corresponding with those cities. It is true
we could not pretend to forbid their people coming to London, because it
was impossible to know them asunder; so, after many consultations, the
Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermen were obliged to drop it. All they could
do was to warn and caution the people not to entertain in their houses
or converse with any people who they knew came from such infected
places.

But they might as well have talked to the air, for the people of London
thought themselves so plague-free now that they were past all
admonitions; they seemed to depend upon it that the air was restored,
and that the air was like a man that had had the smallpox, not capable
of being infected again. This revived that notion that the infection was
all in the air, that there was no such thing as contagion from the sick
people to the sound; and so strongly did this whimsy prevail among
people that they ran all together promiscuously, sick and well. Not the
Mahometans, who, prepossessed with the principle of predestination,
value nothing of contagion, let it be in what it will, could be more
obstinate than the people of London; they that were perfectly sound, and
came out of the wholesome air, as we call it, into the city, made
nothing of going into the same houses and chambers, nay, even into the
same beds, with those that had the distemper upon them, and were not
recovered.

Some, indeed, paid for their audacious boldness with the price of their
lives; an infinite number fell sick, and the physicians had more work
than ever, only with this difference, that more of their patients
recovered; that is to say, they generally recovered, but certainly there
were more people infected and fell sick now, when there did not die
above a thousand or twelve hundred in a week, than there was when there
died five or six thousand a week, so entirely negligent were the people
at that time in the great and dangerous case of health and infection,
and so ill were they able to take or accept of the advice of those who
cautioned them for their good.

The people being thus returned, as it were, in general, it was very
strange to find that in their inquiring after their friends, some whole
families were so entirely swept away that there was no remembrance of
them left, neither was anybody to be found to possess or show any title
to that little they had left; for in such cases what was to be found was
generally embezzled and purloined, some gone one way, some another.

It was said such abandoned effects came to the king, as the universal
heir; upon which we are told, and I suppose it was in part true, that
the king granted all such, as deodands, to the Lord Mayor and Court of
Aldermen of London, to be applied to the use of the poor, of whom there
were very many. For it is to be observed, that though the occasions of
relief and the objects of distress were very many more in the time of
the violence of the plague than now after all was over, yet the distress
of the poor was more now a great deal than it was then, because all the
sluices of general charity were now shut. People supposed the main
occasion to be over, and so stopped their hands; whereas particular
objects were still very moving, and the distress of those that were poor
was very great indeed.

Though the health of the city was now very much restored, yet foreign
trade did not begin to stir, neither would foreigners admit our ships
into their ports for a great while. As for the Dutch, the
misunderstandings between our court and them had broken out into a war
the year before, so that our trade that way was wholly interrupted; but
Spain and Portugal, Italy and Barbary, as also Hamburg and all the ports
in the Baltic, these were all shy of us a great while, and would not
restore trade with us for many months.

The distemper sweeping away such multitudes, as I have observed, many if
not all the out-parishes were obliged to make new burying-grounds,
besides that I have mentioned in Bunhill Fields, some of which were
continued, and remain in use to this day. But others were left off, and
(which I confess I mention with some reflection) being converted into
other uses or built upon afterwards, the dead bodies were disturbed,
abused, dug up again, some even before the flesh of them was perished
from the bones, and removed like dung or rubbish to other places. Some
of those which came within the reach of my observation are as follow:

(1) A piece of ground beyond Goswell Street, near Mount Mill, being some
of the remains of the old lines or fortifications of the city, where
abundance were buried promiscuously from the parishes of Aldersgate,
Clerkenwell, and even out of the city. This ground, as I take it, was
since made a physic garden, and after that has been built upon.

(2) A piece of ground just over the Black Ditch, as it was then called,
at the end of Holloway Lane, in Shoreditch parish. It has been since
made a yard for keeping hogs, and for other ordinary uses, but is quite
out of use as a burying-ground.

(3) The upper end of Hand Alley, in Bishopsgate Street, which was then a
green field, and was taken in particularly for Bishopsgate parish,
though many of the carts out of the city brought their dead thither
also, particularly out of the parish of St All-hallows on the Wall. This
place I cannot mention without much regret. It was, as I remember, about
two or three years after the plague was ceased that Sir Robert Clayton
came to be possessed of the ground. It was reported, how true I know
not, that it fell to the king for want of heirs, all those who had any
right to it being carried off by the pestilence, and that Sir Robert
Clayton obtained a grant of it from King Charles II. But however he came
by it, certain it is the ground was let out to build on, or built upon,
by his order. The first house built upon it was a large fair house,
still standing, which faces the street or way now called Hand Alley
which, though called an alley, is as wide as a street. The houses in the
same row with that house northward are built on the very same ground
where the poor people were buried, and the bodies, on opening the ground
for the foundations, were dug up, some of them remaining so plain to be
seen that the women's skulls were distinguished by their long hair, and
of others the flesh was not quite perished; so that the people began to
exclaim loudly against it, and some suggested that it might endanger a
return of the contagion; after which the bones and bodies, as fast as
they came at them, were carried to another part of the same ground and
thrown all together into a deep pit, dug on purpose, which now is to be
known in that it is not built on, but is a passage to another house at
the upper end of Rose Alley, just against the door of a meeting-house
which has been built there many years since; and the ground is
palisadoed off from the rest of the passage, in a little square; there
lie the bones and remains of near two thousand bodies, carried by the
dead carts to their grave in that one year.

(4) Besides this, there was a piece of ground in Moorfields; by the
going into the street which is now called Old Bethlem, which was
enlarged much, though not wholly taken in on the same occasion.

[N.B.--The author of this journal lies buried in that very ground, being
at his own desire, his sister having been buried there a few years
before.]

(5) Stepney parish, extending itself from the east part of London to the
north, even to the very edge of Shoreditch Churchyard, had a piece of
ground taken in to bury their dead close to the said churchyard, and
which for that very reason was left open, and is since, I suppose, taken
into the same churchyard. And they had also two other burying-places in
Spittlefields, one where since a chapel or tabernacle has been built for
ease to this great parish, and another in Petticoat Lane.

There were no less than five other grounds made use of for the parish of
Stepney at that time: one where now stands the parish church of St Paul,
Shadwell, and the other where now stands the parish church of St John's
at Wapping, both which had not the names of parishes at that time, but
were belonging to Stepney parish.

I could name many more, but these coming within my particular knowledge,
the circumstance, I thought, made it of use to record them. From the
whole, it may be observed that they were obliged in this time of
distress to take in new burying-grounds in most of the out-parishes for
laying the prodigious numbers of people which died in so short a space
of time; but why care was not taken to keep those places separate from
ordinary uses, that so the bodies might rest undisturbed, that I cannot
answer for, and must confess I think it was wrong. Who were to blame I
know not.

I should have mentioned that the Quakers had at that time also a
burying-ground set apart to their use, and which they still make use of;
and they had also a particular dead-cart to fetch their dead from their
houses; and the famous Solomon Eagle, who, as I mentioned before, had
predicted the plague as a judgement, and ran naked through the streets,
telling the people that it was come upon them to punish them for their
sins, had his own wife died the very next day of the plague, and was
carried, one of the first in the Quakers' dead-cart, to their new
burying-ground.

I might have thronged this account with many more remarkable things
which occurred in the time of the infection, and particularly what
passed between the Lord Mayor and the Court, which was then at Oxford,
and what directions were from time to time received from the Government
for their conduct on this critical occasion. But really the Court
concerned themselves so little, and that little they did was of so small
import, that I do not see it of much moment to mention any part of it
here: except that of appointing a monthly fast in the city and the
sending the royal charity to the relief of the poor, both which I have
mentioned before.

Great was the reproach thrown on those physicians who left their
patients during the sickness, and now they came to town again nobody
cared to employ them. They were called deserters, and frequently bills
were set up upon their doors and written, 'Here is a doctor to be let',
so that several of those physicians were fain for a while to sit still
and look about them, or at least remove their dwellings, and set up in
new places and among new acquaintance. The like was the case with the
clergy, whom the people were indeed very abusive to, writing verses and
scandalous reflections upon them, setting upon the church-door, 'Here is
a pulpit to be let', or sometimes, 'to be sold', which was worse.

It was not the least of our misfortunes that with our infection, when it
ceased, there did not cease the spirit of strife and contention, slander
and reproach, which was really the great troubler of the nation's peace
before. It was said to be the remains of the old animosities, which had
so lately involved us all in blood and disorder. But as the late Act of
Indemnity had laid asleep the quarrel itself, so the Government had
recommended family and personal peace upon all occasions to the whole
nation.

But it could not be obtained; and particularly after the ceasing of the
plague in London, when any one that had seen the condition which the
people had been in, and how they caressed one another at that time,
promised to have more charity for the future, and to raise no more
reproaches; I say, any one that had seen them then would have thought
they would have come together with another spirit at last. But, I say,
it could not be obtained. The quarrel remained; the Church and the
Presbyterians were incompatible. As soon as the plague was removed, the
Dissenting ousted ministers who had supplied the pulpits which were
deserted by the incumbents retired; they could expect no other but that
they should immediately fall upon them and harass them with their penal
laws, accept their preaching while they were sick, and persecute them as
soon as they were recovered again; this even we that were of the Church
thought was very hard, and could by no means approve of it.

But it was the Government, and we could say nothing to hinder it; we
could only say it was not our doing, and we could not answer for it.

On the other hand, the Dissenters reproaching those ministers of the
Church with going away and deserting their charge, abandoning the people
in their danger, and when they had most need of comfort, and the like:
this we could by no means approve, for all men have not the same faith
and the same courage, and the Scripture commands us to judge the most
favourably and according to charity.

A plague is a formidable enemy, and is armed with terrors that every man
is not sufficiently fortified to resist or prepared to stand the shock
against. It is very certain that a great many of the clergy who were in
circumstances to do it withdrew and fled for the safety of their lives;
but 'tis true also that a great many of them stayed, and many of them
fell in the calamity and in the discharge of their duty.

It is true some of the Dissenting turned-out ministers stayed, and their
courage is to be commended and highly valued--but these were not
abundance; it cannot be said that they all stayed, and that none retired
into the country, any more than it can be said of the Church clergy that
they all went away. Neither did all those that went away go without
substituting curates and others in their places, to do the offices
needful and to visit the sick, as far as it was practicable; so that,
upon the whole, an allowance of charity might have been made on both
sides, and we should have considered that such a time as this of 1665 is
not to be paralleled in history, and that it is not the stoutest courage
that will always support men in such cases. I had not said this, but had
rather chosen to record the courage and religious zeal of those of both
sides, who did hazard themselves for the service of the poor people in
their distress, without remembering that any failed in their duty on
either side. But the want of temper among us has made the contrary to
this necessary: some that stayed not only boasting too much of
themselves, but reviling those that fled, branding them with cowardice,
deserting their flocks, and acting the part of the hireling, and the
like. I recommend it to the charity of all good people to look back and
reflect duly upon the terrors of the time, and whoever does so will see
that it is not an ordinary strength that could support it. It was not
like appearing in the head of an army or charging a body of horse in the
field, but it was charging Death itself on his pale horse; to stay was
indeed to die, and it could be esteemed nothing less, especially as
things appeared at the latter end of August and the beginning of
September, and as there was reason to expect them at that time; for no
man expected, and I dare say believed, that the distemper would take so
sudden a turn as it did, and fall immediately two thousand in a week,
when there was such a prodigious number of people sick at that time as
it was known there was; and then it was that many shifted away that had
stayed most of the time before.

Besides, if God gave strength to some more than to others, was it to
boast of their ability to abide the stroke, and upbraid those that had
not the same gift and support, or ought not they rather to have been
humble and thankful if they were rendered more useful than their
brethren?

I think it ought to be recorded to the honour of such men, as well
clergy as physicians, surgeons, apothecaries, magistrates, and officers
of every kind, as also all useful people who ventured their lives in
discharge of their duty, as most certainly all such as stayed did to the
last degree; and several of all these kinds did not only venture but
lose their lives on that sad occasion.

I was once making a list of all such, I mean of all those professions
and employments who thus died, as I call it, in the way of their duty;
but it was impossible for a private man to come at a certainty in the
particulars. I only remember that there died sixteen clergymen, two
aldermen, five physicians, thirteen surgeons, within the city and
liberties before the beginning of September. But this being, as I said
before, the great crisis and extremity of the infection, it can be no
complete list. As to inferior people, I think there died six-and-forty
constables and head-boroughs in the two parishes of Stepney and
Whitechappel; but I could not carry my list on, for when the violent
rage of the distemper in September came upon us, it drove us out of all
measures. Men did then no more die by tale and by number. They might put
out a weekly bill, and call them seven or eight thousand, or what they
pleased; 'tis certain they died by heaps, and were buried by heaps, that
is to say, without account. And if I might believe some people, who were
more abroad and more conversant with those things than I though I was
public enough for one that had no more business to do than I had,--I
say, if I may believe them, there was not many less buried those first
three weeks in September than 20,000 per week. However, the others aver
the truth of it; yet I rather choose to keep to the public account;
seven and eight thousand per week is enough to make good all that I have
said of the terror of those times;--and it is much to the satisfaction
of me that write, as well as those that read, to be able to say that
everything is set down with moderation, and rather within compass than
beyond it.

Upon all these accounts, I say, I could wish, when we were recovered,
our conduct had been more distinguished for charity and kindness in
remembrance of the past calamity, and not so much a valuing ourselves
upon our boldness in staying, as if all men were cowards that fly from
the hand of God, or that those who stay do not sometimes owe their
courage to their ignorance, and despising the hand of their Maker--which
is a criminal kind of desperation, and not a true courage.

I cannot but leave it upon record that the civil officers, such as
constables, head-boroughs, Lord Mayor's and sheriffs'-men, as also
parish officers, whose business it was to take charge of the poor, did
their duties in general with as much courage as any, and perhaps with
more, because their work was attended with more hazards, and lay more
among the poor, who were more subject to be infected, and in the most
pitiful plight when they were taken with the infection. But then it must
be added, too, that a great number of them died; indeed it was scarce
possible it should be otherwise.

I have not said one word here about the physic or preparations that we
ordinarily made use of on this terrible occasion--I mean we that went
frequently abroad and up down street, as I did; much of this was talked
of in the books and bills of our quack doctors, of whom I have said
enough already. It may, however, be added, that the College of
Physicians were daily publishing several preparations, which they had
considered of in the process of their practice, and which, being to be
had in print, I avoid repeating them for that reason.

One thing I could not help observing: what befell one of the quacks, who
published that he had a most excellent preservative against the plague,
which whoever kept about them should never be infected or liable to
infection. This man, who, we may reasonably suppose, did not go abroad
without some of this excellent preservative in his pocket, yet was tnture because of the greatness of the danger, which, in my way of
reasoning, is very absurd.

On the contrary, the women have ten thousand times the more reason to
be wary and backward, by how much the hazard of being betrayed is the
greater; and would the ladies consider this, and act the wary part,
they would discover every cheat that offered; for, in short, the lives
of very few men nowadays will bear a character; and if the ladies do
but make a little inquiry, they will soon be able to distinguish the
men and deliver themselves.  As for women that do not think their own
safety worth their thought, that, impatient of their perfect state,
resolve, as they call it, to take the first good Christian that comes,
that run into matrimony as a horse rushes into the battle, I can say
nothing to them but this, that they are a sort of ladies that are to be
prayed for among the rest of distempered people, and to me they look
like people that venture their whole estates in a lottery where there
is a hundred thousand blanks to one prize.

No man of common-sense will value a woman the less for not giving up
herself at the first attack, or for accepting his proposal without
inquiring into his person or character; on the contrary, he must think
her the weakest of all creatures in the world, as the rate of men now
goes.  In short, he must have a very contemptible opinion of her
capacities, nay, every of her understanding, that, having but one case
of her life, shall call that life away at once, and make matrimony,
like death, be a leap in the dark.

I would fain have the conduct of my sex a little regulated in this
particular, which is the thing in which, of all the parts of life, I
think at this time we suffer most in; 'tis nothing but lack of courage,
the fear of not being married at all, and of that frightful state of
life called an old maid, of which I have a story to tell by itself.
This, I say, is the woman's snare; but would the ladies once but get
above that fear and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it
by standing their ground, in a case so absolutely necessary to their
felicity, that by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not
marry so soon as they may do otherwise, they would make themselves
amends by marrying safer.  She is always married too soon who gets a
bad husband, and she is never married too late who gets a good one; in
a word, there is no woman, deformity or lost reputation excepted, but
if she manages well, may be married safely one time or other; but if
she precipitates herself, it is ten thousand to one but she is undone.

But I come now to my own case, in which there was at this time no
little nicety.  The circumstances I was in made the offer of a good
husband the most necessary thing in the world to me, but I found soon
that to be made cheap and easy was not the way.  It soon began to be
found that the widow had no fortune, and to say this was to say all
that was ill of me, for I began to be dropped in all the discourses of
matrimony.  Being well-bred, handsome, witty, modest, and agreeable;
all which I had allowed to my character--whether justly or no is not
the purpose--I say, all these would not do without the dross, which way
now become more valuable than virtue itself.  In short, the widow, they
said, had no money.

I resolved, therefore, as to the state of my present circumstances,
that it was absolutely necessary to change my station, and make a new
appearance in some other place where I was not known, and even to pass
by another name if I found occasion.

I communicated my thoughts to my intimate friend, the captain's lady,
whom I had so faithfully served in her case with the captain, and who
was as ready to serve me in the same kind as I could desire.  I made no
scruple to lay my circumstances open to her; my stock was but low, for
I had made but about #540 at the close of my last affair, and I had
wasted some of that; however, I had about #460 left, a great many very
rich clothes, a gold watch, and some jewels, though of no extraordinary
value, and about #30 or #40 left in linen not disposed of.

My dear and faithful friend, the captain's wife, was so sensible of the
service I had done her in the affair above, that she was not only a
steady friend to me, but, knowing my circumstances, she frequently made
me presents as money came into her hands, such as fully amounted to a
maintenance, so that I spent none of my own; and at last she made this
unhappy proposal to me, viz. that as we had observed, as above, how the
men made no scruple to set themselves out as persons meriting a woman
of fortune, when they had really no fortune of their own, it was but
just to deal with them in their own way and, if it was possible, to
deceive the deceiver.

The captain's lady, in short, put this project into my head, and told
me if I would be ruled by her I should certainly get a husband of
fortune, without leaving him any room to reproach me with want of my
own.  I told her, as I had reason to do, that I would give up myself
wholly to her directions, and that I would have neither tongue to speak
nor feet to step in that affair but as she should direct me, depending
that she would extricate me out of every difficulty she brought me
into, which she said she would answer for.

The first step she put me upon was to call her cousin, and to to a
relation's house of hers in the country, where she directed me, and
where she brought her husband to visit me; and calling me cousin, she
worked matters so about, that her husband and she together invited me
most passionately to come to town and be with them, for they now live
in a quite different place from where they were before.  In the next
place, she tells her husband that I had at least #1500 fortune, and
that after some of my relations I was like to have a great deal more.

It was enough to tell her husband this; there needed nothing on my
side.  I was but to sit still and wait the event, for it presently went
all over the neighbourhood that the young widow at Captain ----'s was a
fortune, that she had at least #1500, and perhaps a great deal more,
and that the captain said so; and if the captain was asked at any time
about me, he made no scruple to affirm it, though he knew not one word
of the matter, other  than that his wife had told him so; and in this
he thought no harm, for he really believed it to be so, because he had
it from his wife:  so slender a foundation will those fellows build
upon, if they do but think there is a fortune in the game.  With the
reputation of this fortune, I presently found myself blessed with
admirers enough, and that I had my choice of men, as scarce as they
said they were, which, by the way, confirms what I was saying before.
This being my case, I, who had a subtle game to play, had nothing now
to do but to single out from them all the properest man that might be
for my purpose; that is to say, the man who was most likely to depend
upon the hearsay of a fortune, and not inquire too far into the
particulars; and unless I did this I did nothing, for my case would not
bear much inquiry.

I picked out my man without much difficulty, by the judgment I made of
his way of courting me.  I had let him run on with his protestations
and oaths that he loved me above all the world; that if I would make
him happy, that was enough; all which I knew was upon supposition, nay,
it was upon a full satisfaction, that I was very rich, though I never
told him a word of it myself.

This was my man; but I was to try him to the bottom, and indeed in that
consisted my safety; for if he baulked, I knew I was undone, as surely
as he was undone if he took me; and if I did not make some scruple
about his fortune, it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine;
and first, therefore, I pretended on all occasions to doubt his
sincerity, and told him, perhaps he only courted me for my fortune.  He
stopped my mouth in that part with the thunder of his protestations, as
above,  but still I pretended to doubt.

One morning he pulls off his diamond ring, and writes upon the glass of
the sash in my chamber this line--

     'You I love, and you alone.'

I read it, and asked him to lend me his ring, with which I wrote under
it, thus--

    'And so in love says every one.'

He takes his ring again, and writes another line thus--

     'Virtue alone is an estate.'

I borrowed it again, and I wrote under it--

     'But money's virtue, gold is fate.'

He coloured as red as fire to see me turn so quick upon him, and in a
kind of a rage told me he would conquer me, and writes again thus--

     'I scorn your gold, and yet I love.'

I ventured all upon the last cast of poetry, as you'll see, for I wrote
boldly under his last--

     'I'm poor:  let's see how kind you'll prove.'

This was a sad truth to me; whether he believed me or no, I could not
tell; I supposed then that he did not.  However, he flew to me, took me
in his arms, and, kissing me very eagerly, and with the greatest
passion imaginable, he held me fast till he called for a pen and ink,
and then told me he could not wait the tedious writing on the glass,
but, pulling out a piece of paper, he began and wrote again--

     'Be mine, with all your poverty.'

I took his pen, and followed him immediately, thus--

     'Yet secretly you hope I lie.'

He told me that was unkind, because it was not just, and that I put him
upon contradicting me, which did not consist with good manners, any
more than with his affection; and therefore, since I had insensibly
drawn him into this poetical scribble, he begged I would not oblige him
to break it off; so he writes again--

     'Let love alone be our debate.'

I wrote again--

     'She loves enough that does not hate.'


This he took for a favour, and so laid down the cudgels, that is to
say, the pen; I say, he took if for a favour, and a mighty one it was,
if he had known all.  However, he took it as I meant it, that is, to
let him think I was inclined to go on with him, as indeed I had all the
reason in the world to do, for he was the best-humoured, merry sort of
a fellow that I ever met with, and I often reflected on myself how
doubly criminal it was to deceive such a man; but that necessity, which
pressed me to a settlement suitable to my condition, was my authority
for it; and certainly his affection to me, and the goodness of his
temper, however they might argue against using him ill, yet they
strongly argued to me that he would better take the disappointment than
some fiery-tempered wretch, who might have nothing to recommend him but
those passions which would serve only to make a woman miserable all her
days.

Besides, though I jested with him (as he supposed it) so often about my
poverty, yet, when he found it to be true, he had foreclosed all manner
of objection, seeing, whether he was in jest or in earnest, he had
declared he took me without any regard to my portion, and, whether I
was in jest or in earnest, I had declared myself to be very poor; so
that, in a word, I had him fast both ways; and though he might say
afterwards he was cheated, yet he could never say that I had cheated
him.

He pursued me close after this, and as I saw there was no need to fear
losing him, I played the indifferent part with him longer than prudence
might otherwise have dictated to me.  But I considered how much this
caution and indifference would give me the advantage over him, when I
should come to be under the necessity of owning my own circumstances to
him; and I managed it the more warily, because I found he inferred from
thence, as indeed he ought to do, that I either had the more money or
the more judgment, and would not venture at all.

I took the freedom one day, after we had talked pretty close to the
subject, to tell him that it was true I had received the compliment of
a lover from him, namely, that he would take me without inquiring into
my fortune, and I would make him a suitable return in this, viz. that I
would make as little inquiry into his as consisted with reason, but I
hoped he would allow me to ask a few questions, which he would answer
or not as he thought fit; and that I would not be offended if he did
not answer me at all; one of these questions related to our manner of
living, and the place where, because I had heard he had a great
plantation in Virginia, and that he had talked of going to live there,
and I told him I did not care to be transported.

He began from this discourse to let me voluntarily into all his
affairs, and to tell me in a frank, open way all his circumstances, by
which I found he was very well to pass in the world; but that great
part of his estate consisted of three plantations, which he had in
Virginia, which brought him in a very good income, generally speaking,
to the tune of #300, a year, but that if he was to live upon them,
would bring him in four times as much.  'Very well,' thought I; 'you
shall carry me thither as soon as you please, though I won't tell you
so beforehand.'

I jested with him extremely about the figure he would make in Virginia;
but I found he would do anything I desired, though he did not seem glad
to have me undervalue his plantations, so I turned my tale.  I told him
I had good reason not to go there to live, because if his plantations
were worth so much there, I had not a fortune suitable to a gentleman
of #1200 a year, as he said his estate would be.

He replied generously, he did not ask what my fortune was; he had told
me from the beginning he would not, and he would be as good as his
word; but whatever it was, he assured me he would never desire me to go
to Virginia with him, or go thither himself without me, unless I was
perfectly willing, and made it my choice.

All this, you may be sure, was as I wished, and indeed nothing could
have happened more perfectly agreeable.  I carried it on as far as this
with a sort of indifferency that he often wondered at, more than at
first, but which was the only support of his courtship; and I mention
it the rather to intimate again to the ladies that nothing but want of
courage for such an indifferency makes our sex so cheap, and prepares
them to be ill-used as they are; would they venture the loss of a
pretending fop now and then, who carries it high upon the point of his
own merit, they would certainly be less slighted, and courted more.
Had I discovered really and truly what my great fortune was, and that
in all I had not full #500 when he expected #1500, yet I had hooked him
so fast, and played him so long, that I was satisfied he would have had
me in my worst circumstances; and indeed it was less a surprise to him
when he learned the truth than it would have been, because having not
the least blame to lay on me, who had carried it with an air of
indifference to the last, he would not say one word, except that indeed
he thought it had been more, but that if it had been less he did not
repent his bargain; only that he should not be able to maintain me so
well as he intended.

In short, we were married, and very happily married on my side, I
assure you, as to the man; for he was the best-humoured man that every
woman had, but his circumstances were not so good as I imagined, as, on
the other hand, he had not bettered himself by marrying so much as he
expected.

When we were married, I was shrewdly put to it to bring him that little
stock I had, and to let him see it was no more; but there was a
necessity for it, so I took my opportunity one day when we were alone,
to enter into a short dialogue with him about it.  'My dear,' said I,
'we have been married a fortnight; is it not time to let you know
whether you have got a wife with something or with nothing?'  'Your own
time for that, my dear,' says he; 'I am satisfied that I have got the
wife I love; I have not troubled you much,' says he, 'with my inquiry
after it.'

'That's true,' says I, 'but I have a great difficulty upon me about it,
which I scarce know how to manage.'

'What's that, m' dear?' says he.

'Why,' says I, ''tis a little hard upon me, and 'tis harder upon you.
I am told that Captain ----' (meaning my friend's husband) 'has told
you I had a great deal more money than I ever pretended to have, and I
am sure I never employed him to do so.'

'Well,' says he, 'Captain ---- may have told me so, but what then?  If
you have not so much, that may lie at his door, but you never told me
what you had, so I have no reason to blame you if you have nothing at
all.'

'That's is so just,' said I, 'and so generous, that it makes my having
but a little a double affliction to me.'

'The less you have, my dear,' says he, 'the worse for us both; but I
hope your affliction you speak of is not caused for fear I should be
unkind to you, for want of a portion.  No, no, if you have nothing,
tell me plainly, and at once; I may perhaps tell the captain he has
cheated me, but I can never say you have cheated me, for did you not
give it under your hand that you were poor?  and so I ought to expect
you to be.'

'Well,' said I, 'my dear, I am glad I have not been concerned in
deceiving you before marriage.  If I deceive you since, 'tis ne'er the
worse; that I am poor is too true, but not so poor as to have nothing
neither'; so I pulled out some bank bills, and gave him about #160.
'There's something, my dear,' said I, 'and not quite all neither.'

I had brought him so near to expecting nothing, by what I had said
before, that the money, though the sum was small in itself, was doubly
welcome to him; he owned it was more than he looked for, and that he
did not question by my discourse to him, but that my fine clothes, gold
watch, and a diamond ring or two, had been all my fortune.

I let him please himself with that #160 two or three days, and then,
having been abroad that day, and as if I had  been to fetch it, I
brought him #100 more home in gold, and told him there was a little
more portion for him; and, in short, in about a week more I brought him
#180 more, and about #60 in linen, which I made him believe I had been
obliged to take with the #100 which I gave him in gold, as a
composition for a debt of #600, being little more than five shillings
in the pound, and overvalued too.

'And now, my dear,' says I to him, 'I am very sorry to tell you, that
there is all, and that I have given you my whole fortune.' I added,
that if the person who had my #600 had not abused me, I had been worth
#1000 to him, but that as it was, I had been faithful to him, and
reserved nothing to myself, but if it had been more he should have had
it.

He was so obliged by the manner, and so pleased with the sum, for he
had been in a terrible fright lest it had been nothing at all, that he
accepted it very thankfully.  And thus I got over the fraud of passing
for a fortune without money, and cheating a man into marrying me on
pretence of a fortune; which, by the way, I take to be one of the most
dangerous steps a woman can take, and in which she runs the most hazard
of being ill-used afterwards.

My husband, to give him his due, was a man of infinite good nature, but
he was no fool; and finding his income not suited to the manner of
living which he had intended, if I had brought him what he expected,
and being under a disappointment in his return of his plantations in
Virginia, he discovered many times his inclination of going over to
Virginia, to live upon his own; and often would be magnifying the way
of living there, how cheap, how plentiful, how pleasant, and the like.

I began presently to understand this meaning, and I took him up very
plainly one morning, and told him that I did so; that I found his
estate turned to no account at this distance, compared to what it would
do if he lived upon the spot, and that I found he had a mind to go and
live there; and I added, that I was sensible he had been disappointed
in a wife, and that finding his expectations not answered that way, I
could do no less, to make him amends, than tell him that I was very
willing to go over to Virginia with him and live there.

He said a thousand kind things to me upon the subject of my making such
a proposal to him.  He told me, that however he was disappointed in his
expectations of a fortune, he was not disappointed in a wife, and that
I was all to him that a wife could be, and he was more than satisfied
on the whole when the particulars were put together, but that this
offer was so kind, that it was more than he could express.

To bring the story short, we agreed to go.  He told me that he had a
very good house there, that it was well furnished, that his mother was
alive and lived in it, and one sister, which was all the relations he
had; that as soon as he came there, his mother would remove to another
house, which was her own for life, and his after her decease; so that I
should have all the house to myself; and I found all this to be exactly
as he had said.

To make this part of the story short, we put on board the ship which we
went in, a large quantity of good furniture for our house, with stores
of linen and other necessaries, and a good cargo for sale, and away we
went.

To give an account of the manner of our voyage, which was long and full
of dangers, is out of my way; I kept no journal, neither did my
husband.  All that I can say is, that after a terrible passage,
frighted twice with dreadful storms, and once with what was still more
terrible, I mean a pirate who came on board and took away almost all
our provisions; and which would have been beyond all to me, they had
once taken my husband to go along with them, but by entreaties were
prevailed with to leave him;--I say, after all these terrible things,
we arrived in York River in Virginia, and coming to our plantation, we
were received with all the demonstrations of tenderness and affection,
by my husband's mother, that were possible to be expressed.

We lived here all together, my mother-in-law, at my entreaty,
continuing in the house, for she was too kind a mother to be parted
with; my husband likewise continued the same as at first, and I thought
myself the happiest creature alive, when an odd and surprising event
put an end to all that felicity in a moment, and rendered my condition
the most uncomfortable, if not the most miserable, in the world.

My mother was a mighty cheerful, good-humoured old woman --I may call
her old woman, for her son was above thirty; I say she was very
pleasant, good company, and used to entertain me, in particular, with
abundance of stories to divert me, as well of  the country we were in
as of the people.

Among the rest, she often told me how the greatest part of the
inhabitants of the colony came thither in very indifferent
circumstances from England; that, generally speaking, they were of two
sorts; either, first, such as were brought over by masters of ships to
be sold as servants.  'Such as we call them, my dear,' says she, 'but
they are more properly called slaves.' Or, secondly, such as are
transported from Newgate and other prisons, after having been found
guilty of felony and other crimes punishable with death.

'When they come here,' says she, 'we make no difference; the planters
buy them, and they work together in the field till their time is out.
When 'tis expired,' said she, 'they have encouragement given them to
plant for themselves; for they have a certain number of acres of land
allotted them by the country, and they go to work to clear and cure the
land, and then to plant it with tobacco and corn for their own use; and
as the tradesmen and merchants will trust them with tools and clothes
and other necessaries, upon the credit of their crop before it is
grown, so they again plant every year a little more than the year
before, and so buy whatever they want with the crop that is before them.

'Hence, child,' says she, 'man a Newgate-bird becomes a great man, and
we have,' continued she, 'several justices of the peace, officers of
the trained bands, and magistrates of the towns they live in, that have
been burnt in the hand.'

She was going on with that part of the story, when her own part in it
interrupted her, and with a great deal of good-humoured confidence she
told me she was one of the second sort of inhabitants herself; that she
came away openly, having ventured too far in a particular case, so that
she was become a criminal.  'And here's the mark of it, child,' says
she; and, pulling off her glove, 'look ye here,' says she, turning up
the palm of her hand, and showed me a very fine white arm and hand, but
branded in the inside of the hand, as in such cases it must be.

This story was very moving to me, but my mother, smiling, said, 'You
need not think a thing strange, daughter, for as I told you, some of
the best men in this country are burnt in the hand, and they are not
ashamed to own it.  There's Major ----,' says she, 'he was an eminent
pickpocket; there's Justice Ba----r, was a shoplifter, and both of them
were burnt in the hand; and I could name you several such as they are.'

We had frequent discourses of this kind, and abundance of instances she
gave me of the like.  After some time, as she was telling some stories
of one that was transported but a few weeks ago, I began in an intimate
kind of way to ask her to tell me something of her own story, which she
did with the utmost plainness and sincerity; how she had fallen into
very ill company in London in her young days, occasioned by her mother
sending her frequently to carry victuals and other relief to a
kinswoman of hers who was a prisoner in Newgate, and who lay in a
miserable starving condition, was afterwards condemned to be hanged,
but having got respite by pleading her belly, dies afterwards in the
prison.

Here my mother-in-law ran out in a long account of the wicked practices
in that dreadful place, and how it ruined more young people that all
the town besides.  'And child,' says my mother, 'perhaps you may know
little of it, or, it may be, have heard nothing about it; but depend
upon it,' says she, 'we all know here that there are more thieves and
rogues made by that one prison of Newgate than by all the clubs and
societies of villains in the nation; 'tis that cursed place,' says my
mother, 'that half peopled this colony.'

Here she went on with her own story so long, and in so particular a
manner, that I began to be very uneasy; but coming to one particular
that required telling her name, I thought I should have sunk down in
the place.  She perceived I was out of order, and asked me if I was not
well, and what ailed me.  I told her I was so affected with the
melancholy story she had told, and the terrible things she had gone
through, that it had overcome me, and I begged of her to talk no more
of it.  'Why, my dear,' says she very kindly, 'what need these things
trouble you?  These passages were long before your time, and they give
me no trouble at all now; nay, I look back on them with a particular
satisfaction, as they have been a means to bring me to this place.'
Then she went on to tell me how she very luckily fell into a good
family, where, behaving herself well, and her mistress dying, her
master married her, by whom she had my husband and his sister, and that
by her diligence and good management after her husband's death, she had
improved the plantations to such a degree as they then were, so that
most of the estate was of her getting, not her husband's, for she had
been a widow upwards of sixteen years.

I heard this part of they story with very little attention, because I
wanted much to retire and give vent to my passions, which I did soon
after; and let any one judge what must be the anguish of my mind, when
I came to reflect that this was certainly no more or less than my own
mother, and I had now had two children, and was big with another by my
own brother, and lay with him still every night.

I was now the most unhappy of all women in the world.  Oh!  had the
story never been told me, all had been well; it had been no crime to
have lain with my husband, since as to his being my relation I had
known nothing of it.

I had now such a load on my mind that it kept me perpetually waking; to
reveal it, which would have been some ease to me, I could not find
would be to any purpose, and yet to conceal it would be next to
impossible; nay, I did not doubt but I should talk of it in my sleep,
and tell my husband of it whether I would or no.  If I discovered it,
the least thing I could expect was to lose my husband, for he was too
nice and too honest a man to have continued my husband after he had
known I had been his sister; so that I was perplexed to the last degree.

I leave it to any man to judge what difficulties presented to my view.
I was away from my native country, at a distance prodigious, and the
return to me unpassable.  I lived very well, but in a circumstance
insufferable in itself.  If I had discovered myself to my mother, it
might be difficult to convince her of the particulars, and I had no way
to prove them.  On the other hand, if she had questioned or doubted me,
I had been undone, for the bare suggestion would have immediately
separated me from my husband, without gaining my mother or him, who
would have been neither a husband nor a brother; so that between the
surprise on one hand, and the uncertainty on the other, I had been sure
to be undone.

In the meantime, as I was but too sure of the fact, I lived therefore
in open avowed incest and whoredom, and all under the appearance of an
honest wife; and though I was not much touched with the crime of it,
yet the action had something in it shocking to nature, and made my
husband, as he thought himself, even nauseous to me.

However, upon the most sedate consideration, I resolved that it was
absolutely necessary to conceal it all and not make the least discovery
of it either to mother or husband; and thus I lived with the greatest
pressure imaginable for three years more, but had no more children.

During this time my mother used to be frequently telling me old stories
of her former adventures, which, however, were no ways pleasant to me;
for by it, though she did not tell it me in plain terms, yet I could
easily understand, joined with what I had heard myself, of my first
tutors, that in her younger days she had been both whore and thief; but
I verily believed she had lived to repent sincerely of both, and that
she was then a very pious, sober, and religious woman.

Well, let her life have been what it would then, it was certain that my
life was very uneasy to me; for I lived, as I have said, but in the
worst sort of whoredom, and as I could expect no good of it, so really
no good issue came of it, and all my seeming prosperity wore off, and
ended in misery and destruction.  It was some time, indeed, before it
came to this, for, but I know not by what ill fate guided, everything
went wrong with us afterwards, and that which was worse, my husband
grew strangely altered, forward, jealous, and unkind, and I was as
impatient of bearing his carriage, as the carriage was unreasonable and
unjust.  These things proceeded so far, that we came at last to be in
such ill terms with one another, that I claimed a promise of him, which
he entered willingly into with me when I consented to come from England
with him, viz. that if I found the country not to agree with me, or
that I did not like to live there, I should come away to England again
when I pleased, giving him a year's warning to settle his affairs.

I say, I now claimed this promise of him, and I must confess I did it
not in the most obliging terms that could be in the world neither; but
I insisted that he treated me ill, that I was remote from my friends,
and could do myself no justice, and that he was jealous without cause,
my conversation having been unblamable, and he having no pretense for
it, and that to remove to England would take away all occasion from him.

I insisted so peremptorily upon it, that he could not avoid coming to a
point, either to keep his word with me or to break it; and this,
notwithstanding he used all the skill he was master of, and employed
his mother and other agents to prevail with me to alter my resolutions;
indeed, the bottom of the thing lay at my heart, and that made all his
endeavours fruitless, for my heart was alienated from him as a husband.
I loathed the thoughts of bedding with him, and used a thousand
pretenses of illness and humour to prevent his touching me, fearing
nothing more than to be with child by him, which to be sure would have
prevented, or at least delayed, my going over to England.

However, at last I put him so out of humour, that he took up a rash and
fatal resolution; in short, I should not go to England; and though he
had promised me, yet it was an unreasonable thing for me to desire it;
that it would be ruinous to his affairs, would unhinge his whole
family, and be next to an undoing him in the world; that therefore I
ought not to desire it of him, and that no wife in the world that
valued her family and her husband's prosperity would insist upon such a
thing.

This plunged me again, for when I considered the thing calmly, and took
my husband as he really was, a diligent, careful man in the main work
of laying up an estate for his children, and that he knew nothing of
the dreadful circumstances that he was in, I could not but confess to
myself that my proposal was very unreasonable, and what no wife that
had the good of her family at heart would have desired.

But my discontents were of another nature; I looked upon him no longer
as a husband, but as a near relation, the son of my own mother, and I
resolved somehow or other to be clear of him, but which way I did not
know, nor did it seem possible.

It is said by the ill-natured world, of our sex, that if we are set on
a thing, it is impossible to turn us from our resolutions; in short, I
never ceased poring upon the means to bring to pass my voyage, and came
that length with my husband at last, as to propose going without him.
This provoked him to the last degree, and he called me not only an
unkind wife, but an unnatural mother, and asked me how I could
entertain such a thought without horror, as that of leaving my two
children (for one was dead) without a mother, and to be brought up by
strangers, and never to see them more.  It was true, had things been
right, I should not have done it, but now it was my real desire never
to see them, or him either, any more; and as to the charge of
unnatural, I could easily answer it to myself, while I knew that the
whole relation was unnatural in the highest degree in the world.

However, it was plain there was no bringing my husband to anything; he
would neither go with me nor let me go without him, and it was quite
out of my power to stir without his consent, as any one that knows the
constitution of the country I was in, knows very well.

We had many family quarrels about it, and they began in time to grow up
to a dangerous height; for as I was quite estranged form my husband (as
he was called) in affection, so I took no heed to my words, but
sometimes gave him language that was provoking; and, in short, strove
all I could to bring him to a parting with me, which was what above all
things in the world I desired most.

He took my carriage very ill, and indeed he might well do so, for at
last I refused to bed with him, and carrying on the breach upon all
occasions to extremity, he told me once he thought I was mad, and if I
did not alter my conduct, he would put me under cure; that is to say,
into a madhouse.  I told him he should find I was far enough from mad,
and that it was not in his power, or any other villain's, to murder me.
I confess at the same time I was heartily frighted at his thoughts of
putting me into a madhouse, which would at once have destroyed all the
possibility of breaking the truth out, whatever the occasion might be;
for that then no one would have given credit to a word of it.

This therefore brought me to a resolution, whatever came of it, to lay
open my whole case; but which way to do it, or to whom, was an
inextricable difficulty, and took me many months to resolve.  In the
meantime, another quarrel with my husband happened, which came up to
such a mad extreme as almost pushed me on to tell it him all to his
face; but though I kept it in so as not to come to the particulars, I
spoke so much as put him into the utmost confusion, and in the end
brought out the whole story.

He began with a calm expostulation upon my being so resolute to go to
England; I defended it, and one hard word bringing on another, as is
usual in all family strife, he told me I did not treat him as if he was
my husband, or talk of my children as if I was a mother; and, in short,
that I did not deserve to be used as a wife; that he had used all the
fair means possible with me; that he had argued with all the kindness
and calmness that a husband or a Christian ought to do, and that I made
him such a vile return, that I treated him rather like a dog than a
man, and rather like the most contemptible stranger than a husband;
that he was very loth to use violence with me, but that, in short, he
saw a necessity of it now, and that for the future he should be obliged
to take such measures as should reduce me to my duty.

My blood was now fired to the utmost, though I knew what he had said
was very true, and nothing could appear more provoked.  I told him, for
his fair means and his foul, they were equally contemned by me; that
for my going to England, I was resolved on it, come what would; and
that as to treating him not like a husband, and not showing myself a
mother to my children, there might be something more in it than he
understood at present; but, for his further consideration, I thought
fit to tell him thus much, that he neither was my lawful husband, nor
they lawful children, and that I had reason to regard neither of them
more than I did.

I confess I was moved to pity him when I spoke it, for he turned pale
as death, and stood mute as one thunderstruck, and once or twice I
thought he would have fainted; in short, it put him in a fit something
like an apoplex; he trembled, a sweat or dew ran off his face, and yet
he was cold as a clod, so that I was forced to run and fetch something
for him to keep life in him.  When he recovered of that, he grew sick
and vomited, and in a little after was put to bed, and the next morning
was, as he had been indeed all night, in a violent fever.

However, it went off again, and he recovered, though but slowly, and
when he came to be a little better, he told me I had given him a mortal
wound with my tongue, and he had only one thing to ask before he
desired an explanation.  I interrupted him, and told him I was sorry I
had gone so far, since I saw what disorder it put him into, but I
desired him not to talk to me of explanations, for that would but make
things worse.

This heightened his impatience, and, indeed, perplexed him beyond all
bearing; for now he began to suspect that there was some mystery yet
unfolded, but could not make the least guess at the real particulars of
it; all that ran in his brain was, that I had another husband alive,
which I could not say in fact might not be true, but I assured him,
however, there was not the least of that in it; and indeed, as to my
other husband, he was effectually dead in law to me, and had told me I
should look on him as such, so I had not the least uneasiness on that
score.

But now I found the thing too far gone to conceal it much longer, and
my husband himself gave me an opportunity to ease myself of the secret,
much to my satisfaction.  He had laboured with me three or four weeks,
but to no purpose, only to tell him whether I had spoken these words
only as the effect of my passion, to put him in a passion, or whether
there was anything of  truth in the bottom of them.  But I continued
inflexible, and would explain nothing, unless he would first consent to
my going to England, which he would never do, he said, while he lived;
on the other hand, I said it was in my power to make him willing when I
pleased--nay, to make him entreat me to go; and this increased his
curiosity, and made him importunate to the highest degree, but it was
all to no purpose.

At length he tells all this story to his mother, and sets her upon me
to get the main secret out of me, and she used her utmost skill with me
indeed; but I put her to a full stop at once by telling her that the
reason and mystery of the whole matter lay in herself, and that it was
my respect to her that had made me conceal it; and that, in short, I
could go no farther, and therefore conjured her not to insist upon it.

She was struck dumb at this suggestion, and could not tell what to say
or to think; but, laying aside the supposition as a policy of mine,
continued her importunity on account of her son, and, if possible, to
make up the breach between us two.  As to that, I told her that it was
indeed a good design in her, but that it was impossible to be done; and
that if I should reveal to her the truth of what she desired, she would
grant it to be impossible, and cease to desire it.  At last I seemed to
be prevailed on by her importunity, and told her I dared trust her with
a secret of the greatest importance, and she would soon see that this
was so, and that I would consent to lodge it in her breast, if she
would engage solemnly not to acquaint her son with it without my
consent.

She was long in promising this part, but rather than not come at the
main secret, she agreed to that too, and after a great many other
preliminaries, I began, and told her the whole story.  First I told her
how much she was concerned in all the unhappy breach which had happened
between her son and me, by telling me her own story and her London
name; and that the surprise she saw I was in was upon that occasion.
The I told her my own story, and my name, and assured her, by such
other tokens as she could not deny, that I was no other, nor more or
less, than her own child, her daughter, born of her body in Newgate;
the same that had saved her from the gallows by being in her belly, and
the same that she left in such-and-such hands when she was transported.

It is impossible to express the astonishment she was in; she was not
inclined to believe the story, or to remember the particulars, for she
immediately foresaw the confusion that must follow in the family upon
it.  But everything concurred so exactly with the stories she had told
me of herself, and which, if she had not told me, she would perhaps
have been content to have denied, that she had stopped her own mouth,
and she had nothing to do but to take me about the neck and kiss me,
and cry most vehemently over me, without speaking one word for a long
time together.  At last she broke out:  'Unhappy child!' says she,
'what miserable chance could bring thee hither? and in the arms of my
own son, too!  Dreadful girl,' says she, 'why, we are all undone!
Married to thy own brother!  Three children, and two alive, all of the
same flesh and blood!  My son and my daughter lying together as husband
and wife!  All confusion and distraction for ever!  Miserable family!
what will become of us?  What is to be said?  What is to be done?'  And
thus she ran on for a great while; nor had I any power to speak, or if
I had, did I know what to say, for every word wounded me to the soul.
With this kind of amazement on our thoughts we parted for the first
time, though my mother was more surprised than I was, because it was
more news to her than to me.  However, she promised again to me at
parting, that she would say nothing of it to her son, till we had
talked of it again.

It was not long, you may be sure, before we had a second conference
upon the same subject; when, as if she had been willing to forget the
story she had told me of herself, or to suppose that I had forgot some
of the particulars, she began to tell them with alterations and
omissions; but I refreshed her memory and set her to rights in many
things which I supposed she had forgot, and then came in so opportunely
with the whole history, that it was impossible for her to go from it;
and then she fell into her rhapsodies again, and exclamations at the
severity of her misfortunes.  When these things were a little over with
her, we fell into a close debate about what should be first done before
we gave an account of the matter to my husband.  But to what purpose
could be all our consultations?  We could neither of us see our way
through it, nor see how it could be safe to open such a scene to him.
It was impossible to make any judgment, or give any guess at what
temper he would receive it in, or what measures he would take upon it;
and if he should have so little government of himself as to make it
public, we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole
family, and expose my mother and me to the last degree; and if at last
he should take the advantage the law would give him, he might put me
away with disdain and leave me to sue for the little portion that I
had, and perhaps waste it all in the suit, and then be a beggar; the
children would be ruined too, having no legal claim to any of his
effects; and thus I should see him, perhaps, in the arms of another
wife in a few months, and be myself the most miserable creature alive.

My mother was as sensible of this as I; and, upon the whole, we knew
not what to do.  After some time we came to more sober resolutions, but
then it was with this misfortune too, that my mother's opinion and mine
were quite different from one another, and indeed inconsistent with one
another; for my mother's opinion was, that I should bury the whole
thing entirely, and continue to live with him as my husband till some
other event should make the discovery of it more convenient; and that
in the meantime she would endeavour to reconcile us together again, and
restore our mutual comfort and family peace; that we might lie as we
used to do together, and so let the whole matter remain a secret as
close as death.  'For, child,' says she, 'we are both undone if it
comes out.'

To encourage me to this, she promised to make me easy in my
circumstances, as far as she was able, and to leave me what she could
at her death, secured for me separately from my husband; so that if it
should come out afterwards, I should not be left destitute, but be able
to stand on my own feet and procure justice from him.

This proposal did not agree at all with my judgment of the thing,
though it was very fair and kind in my mother; but my thoughts ran
quite another way.

As to keeping the thing in our own breasts, and letting it all remain
as it was, I told her it was impossible; and I asked her how she could
think I could bear the thoughts of lying with my own brother.  In the
next place, I told her that her being alive was the only support of the
discovery, and that while she owned me for her child, and saw reason to
be satisfied that I was so, nobody else would doubt it; but that if she
should die before the discovery, I should be taken for an impudent
creature that had forged such a thing to go away from my husband, or
should be counted crazed and distracted.  Then I told her how he had
threatened already to put me into a madhouse, and what concern I had
been in about it, and how that was the thing that drove me to the
necessity of discovering it to her as I had done.

From all which I told her, that I had, on the most serious reflections
I was able to make in the case, come to this resolution, which I hoped
she would like, as a medium between both, viz.  that she should use her
endeavours with her son to give me leave to go to England, as I had
desired, and to furnish me with a sufficient sum of money, either in
goods along with me, or in bills for my support there, all along
suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper to come over
to me.

That when I was gone, she should then, in cold blood, and after first
obliging him in the solemnest manner possible to secrecy, discover the
case to him, doing it gradually, and as her own discretion should guide
her, so that he might not be surprised with it, and fly out into any
passions and excesses on my account, or on hers; and that she should
concern herself to prevent his slighting the children, or marrying
again, unless he had a certain account of my being dead.

This was my scheme, and my reasons were good; I was really alienated
from him in the consequences of these things; indeed, I mortally hated
him as a husband, and it was impossible to remove that riveted aversion
I had to him.  At the same time, it being an unlawful, incestuous
living, added to that aversion, and though I had no great concern about
it in point of conscience, yet everything added to make cohabiting with
him the most nauseous thing to me in the world; and I think verily it
was come to such a height, that I could almost as willingly have
embraced a dog as have let him offer anything of that kind to me, for
which reason I could not bear the thoughts of coming between the sheets
with him.  I cannot say that I was right in point of policy in carrying
it such a length, while at the same time I did not resolve to discover
the thing to him; but I am giving an account of what was, not of what
ought or ought not to be.

In their directly opposite opinion to one another my mother and I
continued a long time, and it was impossible to reconcile our
judgments; many disputes we had about it, but we could never either of
us yield our own, or bring over the other.

I insisted on my aversion to lying with my own brother, and she
insisted upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going
from him to England; and in this uncertainty we continued, not
differing so as to quarrel, or anything like it, but so as not to be
able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible breach that
wus abhorrence.

I cannot but observe also, and leave it for the direction of my sex in
such cases of pleasure, that whenever sincere repentance succeeds such
a crime as this, there never fails to attend a hatred of the object;
and the more the affection might seem to be before, the hatred will be
the more in proportion.  It will always be so, indeed it can be no
otherwise; for there cannot be a true and sincere abhorrence of the
offence, and the love to the cause of it remain; there will, with an
abhorrence of the sin, be found a detestation of the fellow-sinner; you
can expect no other.

I found it so here, though good manners and justice in this gentleman
kept him from carrying it on to any extreme but the short history of
his part in this affair was thus:  he perceived by my last letter, and
by all the rest, which he went for after, that I was not gone to Bath,
that his first letter had not come to my hand; upon which he write me
this following:--


'MADAM,--I am surprised that my letter, dated the 8th of last month,
did not come to your hand; I give you my word it was delivered at your
lodgings, and to the hands of your maid.

'I need not acquaint you with what has been my condition for some time
past; and how, having been at the edge of the grave, I am, by the
unexpected and undeserved mercy of Heaven, restored again.  In the
condition I have been in, it cannot be strange to you that our unhappy
correspondence had not been the least of the burthens which lay upon my
conscience.  I need say no more; those things that must be repented of,
must be also reformed.

I wish you would think of going back to the Bath.  I enclose you here a
bill for #50 for clearing yourself at your lodgings, and carrying you
down, and hope it will be no surprise to you to add, that on this
account only, and not for any offence given me on your side, I can see
you no more.  I will take due care of the child; leave him where he is,
or take him with you, as you please.  I wish you the like reflections,
and that they may be to your advantage.--I am,' etc.


I was struck with this letter as with a thousand wounds, such as I
cannot describe; the reproaches of my own conscience were such as I
cannot express, for I was not blind to my own crime; and I reflected
that I might with less offence have continued with my brother, and
lived with him as a wife, since there was no crime in our marriage on
that score, neither of us knowing it.

But I never once reflected that I was all this while a married woman, a
wife to Mr. ---- the linen-draper, who, though he had left me by the
necessity of his circumstances, had no power to discharge me from the
marriage contract which was between us, or to give me a legal liberty
to marry again; so that I had been no less than a whore and an
adulteress all this while.  I then reproached myself with the liberties
I had taken, and how I had been a snare to this gentleman, and that
indeed I was principal in the crime; that now he was mercifully
snatched out of the gulf by a convincing work upon his mind, but that I
was left as if I was forsaken of God's grace, and abandoned by Heaven
to a continuing in my wickedness.

Under these reflections I continued very pensive and sad for near
month, and did not go down to the Bath, having no inclination to be
with the woman whom I was with before; lest, as I thought, she should
prompt me to some wicked course of life again, as she had done; and
besides, I was very loth she should know I was cast off as above.

And now I was greatly perplexed about my little boy.  It was death to
me to part with the child, and yet when I considered the danger of
being one time or other left with him to keep without a maintenance to
support him, I then resolved to leave him where he was; but then I
concluded also to be near him myself too, that I then might have the
satisfaction of seeing him, without the care of providing for him.

I sent my gentleman a short letter, therefore, that I had obeyed his
orders in all things but that of going back to the Bath, which I could
not think of for many reasons; that however parting from him was a
wound to me that I could never recover, yet that I was fully satisfied
his reflections were just, and would be very far from desiring to
obstruct his reformation or repentance.

Then I represented my own circumstances to him in the most moving terms
that I was able.  I told him that those unhappy distresses which first
moved him to a generous and an honest friendship for me, would, I hope,
move him to a little concern for me now, though the criminal part of
our correspondence, which I believed neither of us intended to fall
into at the time, was broken off; that I desired to repent as sincerely
as he had done, but entreated him to put me in some condition that I
might not be exposed to the temptations which the devil never fails to
excite us to from the frightful prospect of poverty and distress; and
if he had the least apprehensions of my being troublesome to him, I
begged he would put me in a posture to go back to my mother in
Virginia, from when he knew I came, and that would put an end to all
his fears on that account.  I concluded, that if he would send me #50
more to facilitate my going away, I would send him back a general
release, and would promise never to disturb him more with any
importunities; unless it was to hear of the well-doing of the child,
whom, if I found my mother living and my circumstances able, I would
send for to come over to me, and take him also effectually off his
hands.

This was indeed all a cheat thus far, viz. that I had no intention to
go to Virginia, as the account of my former affairs there may convince
anybody of; but the business was to get this last #50 of him, if
possible, knowing well enough it would be the last penny I was ever to
expect.

However, the argument I used, namely, of giving him a general release,
and never troubling him any more, prevailed effectually with him, and
he sent me a bill for the money by a person who brought with him a
general release for me to sign, and which I frankly signed, and
received the money; and thus, though full sore against my will, a final
end was put to this affair.

And here I cannot but reflect upon the unhappy consequence of too great
freedoms between persons stated as we were, upon the pretence of
innocent intentions, love of friendship, and the like; for the flesh
has generally so great a share in those friendships, that is great odds
but inclination prevails at last over the most solemn resolutions; and
that vice breaks in at the breaches of decency, which really innocent
friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness.  But I leave
the readers of these things to their own just reflections, which they
will be more able to make effectual than I, who so soon forgot myself,
and am therefore but a very indifferent monitor.

I was now a single person again, as I may call myself; I was loosed
from all the obligations either of wedlock or mistress-ship in the
world, except my husband the linen-draper, whom, I having not now heard
from in almost fifteen years, nobody could blame me for thinking myself
entirely freed from; seeing also he had at his going away told me, that
if I did not hear frequently from him, I should conclude he was dead,
and I might freely marry again to whom I pleased.

I now began to cast up my accounts.  I had by many letters and much
importunity, and with the intercession of my mother too, had a second
return of some goods from my brother (as I now call him) in Virginia,
to make up the damage of the cargo I brought away with me, and this too
was upon the condition of my sealing a general release to him, and to
send it him by his correspondent at Bristol, which, though I thought
hard of, yet I was obliged to promise to do.  However, I managed so
well in this case, that I got my goods away before the release was
signed, and then I always found something or other to say to evade the
thing, and to put off the signing it at all; till at length I pretended
I must write to my brother, and have his answer, before I could do it.

Including this recruit, and before I got the last #50, I found my
strength to amount, put all together, to about #400, so that with that
I had about #450.  I had saved above #100 more, but I met with a
disaster with that, which was this--that a goldsmith in whose hands I
had trusted it, broke, so I lost #70 of my money, the man's composition
not making above #30 out of his #100.  I had a little plate, but not
much, and was well enough stocked with clothes and linen.

With this stock I had the world to begin again; but you are to consider
that I was not now the same woman as when I lived at Redriff; for,
first of all, I was near twenty years older, and did not look the
better for my age, nor for my rambles to Virginia and back again; and
though I omitted nothing that might set me out to advantage, except
painting, for that I never stooped to, and had pride enough to think I
did not want it, yet there would always be some difference seen between
five-and-twenty and two-and-forty.

I cast about innumerable ways for my future state of life, and began to
consider very seriously what I should do, but nothing offered.  I took
care to make the world take me for something more than I was, and had
it given out that I was a fortune, and that my estate was in my own
hands; the last of which was very true, the first of it was as above.
I had no acquaintance, which was one of my worst misfortunes, and the
consequence of that was, I had no adviser, at least who could assist
and advise together; and above all, I had nobody to whom I could in
confidence commit the secret of my circumstances to, and could depend
upon for their secrecy and fidelity; and I found by experience, that to
be friendless is the worst condition, next to being in want that a
woman can be reduced to:  I say a woman, because 'tis evident men can
be their own advisers, and their own directors, and know how to work
themselves out of difficulties and into business better than women; but
if a woman has no friend to communicate her affairs to, and to advise
and assist her, 'tis ten to one but she is undone; nay, and the more
money she has, the more danger she is in of being wronged and deceived;
and this was my case in the affair of the #100 which I left in the
hands of the goldsmith, as above, whose credit, it seems, was upon the
ebb before, but I, that had no knowledge of things and nobody to
consult with, knew nothing of it, and so lost my money.

In the next place, when a woman is thus left desolate and void of
counsel, she is just like a bag of money or a jewel dropped on the
highway, which is a prey to the next comer; if a man of virtue and
upright principles happens to find it, he will have it cried, and the
owner may come to hear of it again; but how many times shall such a
thing fall into hands that will make no scruple of seizing it for their
own, to once that it shall come into good hands?

This was evidently my case, for I was now a loose, unguided creature,
and had no help, no assistance, no guide for my conduct; I knew what I
aimed at and what I wanted, but knew nothing how to pursue the end by
direct means.  I wanted to be placed in a settle state of living, and
had I happened to meet with a sober, good husband, I should have been
as faithful and true a wife to him as virtue itself could have formed.
If I had been otherwise, the vice came in always at the door of
necessity, not at the door of inclination; and I understood too well,
by the want of it, what the value of a settled life was, to do anything
to forfeit the felicity of it; nay, I should have made the better wife
for all the difficulties I had passed through, by a great deal; nor did
I in any of the time that I had been a wife give my husbands the least
uneasiness on account of my behaviour.

But all this was nothing; I found no encouraging prospect.  I waited; I
lived regularly, and with as much frugality as became my circumstances,
but nothing offered, nothing presented, and the main stock wasted
apace.  What to do I knew not; the terror of approaching poverty lay
hard upon my spirits.  I had some money, but where to place it I knew
not, nor would the interest of it maintain me, at least not in London.

At length a new scene opened.  There was in the house where I lodged a
north-country woman that went for a gentlewoman, and nothing was more
frequent in her discourse than her account of the cheapness of
provisions, and the easy way of living in her country; how plentiful
and how cheap everything was, what good company they kept, and the
like; till at last I told her she almost tempted me to go and live in
her country; for I that was a widow, though I had sufficient to live
on, yet had no way of increasing it; and that I found I could not live
here under #100 a year, unless I kept no company, no servant, made no
appearance, and buried myself in privacy, as if I was obliged to it by
necessity.

I should have observed, that she was always made to believe, as
everybody else was, that I was a great fortune, or at least that I had
three or four thousand pounds, if not more, and all in my own hands;
and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclined in the
least to go into her country.  She said she had a sister lived near
Liverpool, that her brother was a considerable gentleman there, and had
a great estate also in Ireland; that she would go down there in about
two months, and if I would give her my company thither, I should be as
welcome as herself for a month or more as I pleased, till I should see
how I liked the country; and if I thought fit to live there, she would
undertake they would take care, though they did not entertain lodgers
themselves, they would recommend me to some agreeable family, where I
should be placed to my content.

If this woman had known my real circumstances, she would never have
laid so many snares, and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor
desolate creature that was good for little when it was caught; and
indeed I, whose case was almost desperate, and thought I could not be
much worse, was not very anxious about what might befall me, provided
they did me no personal injury; so I suffered myself, though not
without a great deal of invitation and great professions of sincere
friendship and real kindness--I say, I suffered myself to be prevailed
upon to go with her, and accordingly I packed up my baggage, and put
myself in a posture for a journey, though I did not absolutely know
whither I was to go.

And now I found myself in great distress; what little I had in the
world was all in money, except as before, a little plate, some linen,
and my clothes; as for my household stuff, I had little or none, for I
had lived always in lodgings; but I had not one friend in the world
with whom to trust that little I had, or to direct me how to dispose of
it, and this perplexed me night and day.  I thought of the bank, and of
the other companies in London, but I had no friend to commit the
management of it to, and keep and carry about with me bank bills,
tallies, orders, and such things, I looked upon at as unsafe; that if
they were lost, my money was lost, and then I was undone; and, on the
other hand, I might be robbed and perhaps murdered in a strange place
for them.  This perplexed me strangely, and what to do I knew not.

It came in my thoughts one morning that I would go to the bank myself,
where I had often been to receive the interest of some bills I had,
which had interest payable on them, and where I had found a clerk, to
whom I applied myself, very honest and just to me, and particularly so
fair one time that when I had mistold my money, and taken less than my
due, and was coming away, he set me to rights and gave me the rest,
which he might have put into his own pocket.

I went to him and represented my case very plainly, and asked if he
would trouble himself to be my adviser, who was a poor friendless
widow, and knew not what to do.  He told me, if I desired his opinion
of anything within the reach of his business, he would do his endeavour
that I should not be wronged, but that he would also help me to a good
sober person who was a grave man of his acquaintance, who was a clerk
in such business too, though not in their house, whose judgment was
good, and whose honesty I might depend upon.  'For,' added he, 'I will
answer for him, and for every step he takes; if he wrongs you, madam,
of one farthing, it shall lie at my door, I will make it good; and he
delights to assist people in such cases--he does it as an act of
charity.'

I was a little at a stand in this discourse; but after some pause I
told him I had rather have depended upon him, because I had found him
honest, but if that could not be, I would take his recommendation
sooner than any one's else.  'I dare say, madam,' says he, 'that you
will be as well satisfied with my friend as with me, and he is
thoroughly able to assist you, which I am not.'  It seems he had his
hands full of the business of the bank, and had engaged to meddle with
no other business that that of his office, which I heard afterwards,
but did not understand then.  He added, that his friend should take
nothing of me for his advice or assistance, and this indeed encouraged
me very much.

He appointed the same evening, after the bank was shut and business
over, for me to meet him and his friend.  And indeed as soon as I saw
his friend, and he began but to talk of the affair, I was fully
satisfied that I had a very honest man to deal with; his countenance
spoke it, and his character, as I heard afterwards, was everywhere so
good, that I had no room for any more  doubts upon me.

After the first meeting, in which I only said what I had said before,
we parted, and he appointed me to come the next day to him, telling me
I might in the meantime satisfy myself of him by inquiry, which,
however, I knew not how well to do, having no acquaintance myself.

Accordingly I met him the next day, when I entered more freely with him
into my case.  I told him my circumstances at large:  that I was a
widow come over from America, perfectly desolate and friendless; that
I had a little money, and but a little, and was almost distracted for
fear of losing it, having no friend in the world to trust with the
management of it; that I was going into the north of England to live
cheap, that my stock might not waste; that I would willingly lodge my
money in the bank, but that I durst not carry the bills about me, and
the like, as above; and how to correspond about it, or with whom, I
knew not.

He told me I might lodge the money in the bank as an account, and its
being entered into the books would entitle me to the money at any time,
and if I was in the north I might draw bills on the cashier and receive
it when I would; but that then it would be esteemed as running cash,
and the bank would give no interest for it; that I might buy stock with
it, and so it would lie in store for me, but that then if I wanted to
dispose if it, I must come up to town on purpose to transfer it, and
even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half-yearly
dividend, unless I was here in person, or had some friend I could trust
with having the stock in his name to do it for me, and that would have
the same difficulty in it as before; and with that he looked hard at me
and smiled a little.  At last, says he, 'Why do you not get a head
steward, madam, that may take you and your money together into keeping,
and then you would have the trouble taken off your hands?'  'Ay, sir,
and the money too, it may be,' said I; 'for truly I find the hazard
that way is as much as 'tis t'other way'; but I remember I said
secretly to myself, 'I wish you would ask me the question fairly, I
would consider very seriously on it before I said No.'

He went on a good way with me, and I thought once or twice he was in
earnest, but to my real affliction, I found at last he had a wife; but
when he owned he had a wife he shook his head, and said with some
concern, that indeed he had a wife, and no wife.  I began to think he
had been in the condition of my late lover, and that his wife had been
distempered or lunatic, or some such thing.  However, we had not much
more discourse at that time, but he told me he was in too much hurry of
business then, but that if I would come home to his house after their
business was over, he would by that time consider what might be done
for me, to put my affairs in a posture of security.  I told him I would
come, and desired to know where he lived.  He gave me a direction in
writing, and when he gave it me he read it to me, and said, 'There
'tis, madam, if you dare trust yourself with me.'  'Yes, sir,' said I,
'I believe I may venture to trust you with myself, for you have a wife,
you say, and I don't want a husband; besides, I dare trust you with my
money, which is all I have in the world, and if that were gone, I may
trust myself anywhere.'

He said some things in jest that were very handsome and mannerly, and
would have pleased me very well if they had been in earnest; but that
passed over, I took the directions, and appointed to attend him at his
house at seven o'clock the same evening.

When I came he made several proposals for my placing my money in the
bank, in order to my having interest for it; but still some difficulty
or other came in the way, which he objected as not safe; and I found
such a sincere disinterested honesty in him, that I began to muse with
myself, that I had certainly found the honest man I wanted, and that I
could never put myself into better hands; so I told him with a great
deal of frankness that I had never met with a man or woman yet that I
could trust, or in whom I could think myself safe, but that I saw he
was so disinterestedly concerned for my safety, that I said I would
freely trust him with the management of that little I had, if he would
accept to be steward for a poor widow that could give him no salary.

He smiled and, standing up, with great respect saluted me.  He told me
he could not but take it very kindly that I had so good an opinion of
him; that he would not deceive me, that he would do anything in his
power to serve me, and expect no salary; but that he could not by any
means accept of a trust, that it might bring him to be suspected of
self-interest, and that if I should die he might have disputes with my
executors, which he should be very loth to encumber himself with.

I told him if those were all his objections I would soon remove them,
and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty;
for that, first, as for suspecting him, if ever I should do it, now is
the time to suspect him, and not put the trust into his hands, and
whenever I did suspect him, he could but throw it up then and refuse to
go any further.  Then, as to executors, I assured him I had no heirs,
nor any relations in England, and I should alter my condition before I
died, and then his trust and trouble should cease together, which,
however, I had no prospect of yet; but I told him if I died as I was,
it should be all his own, and he would deserve it by being so faithful
to me as I was satisfied he would be.

He changed his countenance at this discourse, and asked me how I came
to have so much good-will for him; and, looking very much pleased, said
he might very lawfully wish he was a single man for my sake.  I smiled,
and told him as he was not, my offer could have no design upon him in
it, and to wish, as he did, was not to be allowed, 'twas criminal to
his wife.

He told me I was wrong.  'For,' says he, 'madam, as I said before, I
have a wife and no wife, and 'twould be no sin to me to wish her
hanged, if that were all.'  'I know nothing of your circumstances that
way, sir,' said I; 'but it cannot be innocent to wish your wife dead.'
'I tell you,' says he again, 'she is a wife and no wife; you don't know
what I am, or what she is.'

'That's true,' said I; 'sir, I do not know what you are, but I believe
you to be an honest man, and that's the cause of all my confidence in
you.'

'Well, well,' says he, 'and so I am, I hope, too.  But I am something
else too, madam; for,' says he, 'to be plain with you, I am a cuckold,
and she is a whore.'  He spoke it in a kind of jest, but it was with
such an awkward smile, that I perceived it was what struck very close
to him, and he looked dismally when he said it.

'That alters the case indeed, sir,' said I, 'as to that part you were
speaking of; but a cuckold, you know, may be an honest man; it does not
alter that case at all.  Besides, I think,' said I, 'since your wife is
so dishonest to you, you are too honest to her to own her for your
wife; but that,' said I, 'is what I have nothing to do with.'

'Nay,' says he, 'I do not think to clear my hands of her; for, to be
plain with you, madam,' added he, 'I am no contended cuckold neither:
on the other hand, I assure you it provokes me the highest degree, but
I can't help myself; she that will be a whore, will be a whore.'

I waived the discourse and began to talk of my business; but I found he
could not have done with it, so I let him alone, and he went on to tell
me all the circumstances of his case, too long to relate here;
particularly, that having been out of England some time before he came
to the post he was in, she had had two children in the meantime by an
officer of the army; and that when he came to England and, upon her
submission, took her again, and maintained her very well, yet she ran
away from him with a linen-draper's apprentice, robbed him of what she
could come at, and continued to live from him still.  'So that, madam,'
says he, 'she is a whore not by necessity, which is the common bait of
your sex, but by inclination, and for the sake of the vice.'

Well, I pitied him, and wished him well rid of her, and still would
have talked of my business, but it would not do.  At last he looks
steadily at me.  'Look you, madam,' says he, 'you came to ask advice of
me, and I will serve you as faithfully as if you were my own sister;
but I must turn the tables, since you oblige me to do it, and are so
friendly to me, and I think I must ask advice of you.  Tell me, what
must a poor abused fellow do with a whore?  What can I do to do myself
justice upon her?'

'Alas! sir,' says I, ''tis a case too nice for me to advise in, but it
seems she has run away from you, so you are rid of her fairly; what can
you desire more?'  'Ay, she is gone indeed,' said he, 'but I am not
clear of her for all that.'

'That's true,' says I; 'she may indeed run you into debt, but the law
has furnished you with methods to prevent that also; you may cry her
down, as they call it.'

'No, no,' says he, 'that is not the case neither; I have taken care of
all that; 'tis not that part that I speak of, but I would be rid of her
so that I might marry again.'

'Well, sir,' says I, 'then you must divorce her.  If you can prove what
you say, you may certainly get that done, and then, I suppose, you are
free.'

'That's very tedious and expensive,' says he.

'Why,' says I, 'if you can get any woman you like to take your word, I
suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with you that she takes
herself.'

'Ay,' says he, 'but 'twould be hard to bring an honest woman to do
that; and for the other sort,' says he, 'I have had enough of her to
meddle with any more whores.'

It occurred to me presently, 'I would have taken your word with all my
heart, if you had but asked me the question'; but that was to myself.
To him I replied, 'Why, you shut the door against any honest woman
accepting you, for you condemn all that should venture upon you at
once, and conclude, that really a woman that takes you now can't be
honest.'

'Why,' says he, 'I wish you would satisfy me that an honest woman would
take me; I'd venture it'; and then turns short upon me, 'Will you take
me, madam?'

'That's not a fair question,' says I, 'after what you have said;
however, lest you should think I wait only for a recantation of it, I
shall answer you plainly, No, not I; my business is of another kind
with you, and I did not expect you would have turned my serious
application to you, in my own distracted case, into a comedy.'

'Why, madam,' says he, 'my case is as distracted as yours can be, and I
stand in as much need of advice as you do, for I think if I have not
relief somewhere, I shall be made myself, and I know not what course to
take, I protest to you.'

'Why, sir,' says I, ''tis easy to give advice in your case, much easier
than it is in mine.'  'Speak then,' says he, 'I beg of you, for now you
encourage me.'

'Why,' says I, 'if your case is so plain as you say it is, you may be
legally divorced, and then you may find honest women enough to ask the
question of fairly; the sex is not so scarce that you can want a wife.'

'Well, then,' said he, 'I am in earnest; I'll take your advice; but
shall I ask you one question seriously beforehand?'

'Any question,' said I, 'but that you did before.'

'No, that answer will not do,' said he, 'for, in short, that is the
question I shall ask.'

'You may ask what questions you please, but you have my answer to that
already,' said I.  'Besides, sir,' said I, 'can you think so ill of me
as that I would give any answer to such a question beforehand?  Can any
woman alive believe you in earnest, or think you design anything but to
banter her?'

'Well, well,' says he, 'I do not banter you, I am in earnest; consider
of it.'

'But, sir,' says I, a little gravely, 'I came to you about my own
business; I beg of you to let me know, what you will advise me to do?'

'I will be prepared,' says he, 'against you come again.'

'Nay,' says I, 'you have forbid my coming any more.'

'Why so?' said he, and looked a little surprised.

'Because,' said I, 'you can't expect I should visit you on the account
you talk of.'

'Well,' says he, 'you shall promise me to come again, however, and I
will not say any more of it till I have gotten the divorce, but I
desire you will prepare to be better conditioned when that's done, for
you shall be the woman, or I will not be divorced at all; why, I owe it
to your unlooked-for kindness, if it were to nothing else, but I have
other reasons too.'

He could not have said anything in the world that pleased me better;
however, I knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the
thing was so remote, as it appeared to be, and that it was time enough
to accept of it when he was able to perform it; so I said very
respectfully to him, it was time enough to consider of these things
when he was in a condition to talk of them; in the meantime, I told
him, I was going a great way from him, and he would find objects enough
to please him better.  We broke off here for the present, and he made
me promise him to come again the next day, for his resolutions upon my
own business, which after some pressing I did; though had he seen
farther into me, I wanted no pressing on that account.

I came the next evening, accordingly, and brought my maid with me, to
let him see that I kept a maid, but I sent her away as soon as I was
gone in.  He would have had me let the maid have stayed, but I would
not, but ordered her aloud to come for me again about nine o'clock.
But he forbade that, and told me he would see me safe home, which, by
the way, I was not very well please with, supposing he might do that to
know where I lived and inquire into my character and circumstances.
However, I ventured that, for all that the people there or thereabout
knew of me, was to my advantage; and all the character he had of me,
after he had inquired, was that I was a woman of fortune, and that I
was a very modest, sober body; which, whether true or not in the main,
yet you may see how necessary it is for all women who expect anything
in the world, to preserve the character of their virtue, even when
perhaps they may have sacrificed the thing itself.

I found, and was not a little please with it, that he had provided a
supper for me.  I found also he lived very handsomely, and had a house
very handsomely furnished; all of which I was rejoiced at indeed, for I
looked upon it as all my own.

We had now a second conference upon the subject-matter of the last
conference.  He laid his business very home indeed; he protested his
affection to me, and indeed I had no room to doubt it; he declared that
it began from the first moment I talked with him, and long before I had
mentioned leaving my effects with him.  ''Tis no matter when it began,'
thought I; 'if it will but hold, 'twill be well enough.'  He then told
me how much the offer I had made of trusting him with my effects, and
leaving them to him, had engaged him.  'So I intended it should,'
thought I, 'but then I thought you had been a single man too.'  After
we had supped, I observed he pressed me very hard to drink two or three
glasses of wine, which, however, I declined, but drank one glass or
two.  He then told me he had a proposal to make to me, which I should
promise him I would not take ill if I should not grant it.  I told him
I hoped he would make no dishonourable proposal to me, especially in
his own house, and that if it was such, I desired he would not propose
it, that I might not be obliged to offer any resentment to him that did
not become the respect I professed for him, and the trust I had placed
in him in coming to his house; and begged of him he would give me leave
to go away, and accordingly began to put on my gloves and prepare to be
gone, though at the same time I no more intended it than he intended to
let me.

Well, he importuned me not to talk of going; he assured me he had no
dishonourable thing in his thoughts about me, and was very far from
offering anything to me that was dishonourable, and if I thought so, he
would choose to say no more of it.

That part I did not relish at all.  I told him I was ready to hear
anything that he had to say, depending that he would say nothing
unworthy of himself, or unfit for me to hear.  Upon this, he told me
his proposal was this:  that I would marry him, though he had not yet
obtained the divorce from the whore his wife; and to satisfy me that he
meant honourably, he would promise not to desire me to live with him,
or go to bed with him till the divorce was obtained.  My heart said yes
to this offer at first word, but it was necessary to play the hypocrite
a little more with him; so I seemed to decline the motion with some
warmth, and besides a little condemning the thing as unfair, told him
that such a proposal could be of no signification, but to entangle us
both in great difficulties; for if he should not at last obtain the
divorce, yet we could not dissolve the marriage, neither could we
proceed in it; so that if he was disappointed in the divorce, I left
him to consider what a condition we should both be in.

In short, I carried on the argument against this so far, that I
convinced him it was not a proposal that had any sense in it.  Well,
then he went from it to another, and that was, that I would sign and
seal a contract with him, conditioning to marry him as soon as the
divorce was obtained, and to be void if he could not obtain it.

I told him such a thing was more rational than the other; but as this
was the first time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in
earnest in this affair, I did not use to say Yes at first asking; I
would consider of it.

I played with this lover as an angler does with a trout.  I found I had
him fast on the hook, so I jested with his new proposal, and put him
off.  I told him he knew little of me, and bade him inquire about me; I
let him also go home with me to my lodging, though I would not ask him
to go in, for I told him it was not decent.

In short, I ventured to avoid signing a contract of marriage, and the
reason why I did it was because the lady that had invited me so
earnestly to go with her into Lancashire insisted so positively upon
it, and promised me such great fortunes, and such fine things there,
that I was tempted to go and try.  'Perhaps,' said I, 'I may mend
myself very much'; and then I made no scruple in my thoughts of
quitting my honest citizen, whom I was not so much in love with as not
to leave him for a richer.

In a word, I avoided a contract; but told him I would go into the
north, that he should know where to write to me by the consequence of
the business I had entrusted with him; that I would give him a
sufficient pledge of my respect for him, for I would leave almost all I
had in the world in his hands; and I would thus far give him my word,
that as soon as he had sued out a divorce from his first wife, he would
send me an account of it, I would come up to London, and that then we
would talk seriously of the matter.

It was a base design I went with, that I must confess, though I was
invited thither with a design much worse than mine was, as the sequel
will discover.  Well, I went with my friend, as I called her, into
Lancashire.  All the way we went she caressed me with the utmost
appearance of a sincere, undissembled affection; treated me, except my
coach-hire, all the way; and her brother brought a gentleman's coach to
Warrington to receive us, and we were carried from thence to Liverpool
with as much ceremony as I could desire.  We were also entertained at a
merchant's house in Liverpool three or four days very handsomely; I
forbear to tell his name, because of what followed.  Then she told me
she would carry me to an uncle's house of hers, where we should be
nobly entertained.  She did so; her uncle, as she called him, sent a
coach and four horses for us, and we were carried near forty miles I
know not whither.

We came, however, to a gentleman's seat, where was a numerous family, a
large park, extraordinary company indeed, and where she was called
cousin.  I told her if she had resolved to bring me into such company
as this, she should have let me have prepared myself, and have
furnished myself with better clothes.  The ladies took notice of that,
and told me very genteelly they did not value people in their country
so much by their clothes as they did in London; that their cousin had
fully informed them of my quality, and that I did not want clothes to
set me off; in short, they entertained me, not like what I was, but
like what they thought I had been, namely, a widow lady of a great
fortune.

The first discovery I made here was, that the family were all Roman
Catholics, and the cousin too, whom I called my friend; however, I must
say that nobody in the world could behave better to me, and I had all
the civility shown me that I could have had if I had been of their
opinion.  The truth is, I had not so much principle of any kind as to
be nice in point of religion, and I presently learned to speak
favourably of the Romish Church; particularly, I told them I saw little
but the prejudice of education in all the difference that were among
Christians about religion, and if it had so happened that my father had
been a Roman Catholic, I doubted not but I should have been as well
pleased with their religion as my own.

This obliged them in the highest degree, and as I was besieged day and
night with good company and pleasant discourse, so I had two or three
old ladies that lay at me upon the subject of religion too.  I was so
complaisant, that though I would not completely engage, yet I made no
scruple to be present at their mass, and to conform to all their
gestures as they showed me the pattern, but I would not come too cheap;
so that I only in the main encouraged them to expect that I would turn
Roman Catholic, if I was instructed in the Catholic doctrine as they
called it, and so the matter rested.

I stayed here about six weeks; and then my conductor led me back to a
country village, about six miles from Liverpool, where her brother (as
she called him) came to visit me in his own chariot, and in a very good
figure, with two footmen in a good livery; and the next thing was to
make love to me.  As it had happened to me, one would think I could not
have been cheated, and indeed I thought so myself, having a safe card
at home, which I resolved not to quit unless I could mend myself very
much.  However, in all appearance this brother was a match worth my
listening to, and the least his estate was valued at was #1000 a year,
but the sister said it was worth #1500 a year, and  lay most of it in
Ireland.

I that was a great fortune, and passed for such, was above being asked
how much my estate was; and my false friend taking it upon a foolish
hearsay, had raised it from #500 to #5000, and by the time she came
into the country she called it  #15,000.  The Irishman, for such I
understood him to be, was stark mad at this bait; in short, he courted
me, made me presents, and ran in debt like a madman for the expenses of
his equipage and of  his courtship.  He had, to give him his due, the
appearance of an extraordinary fine gentleman; he was tall,
well-shaped, and had an extraordinary address; talked as naturally of
his park and his stables, of his horses, his gamekeepers, his woods,
his tenants, and his servants, as if we had been in the mansion-house,
and I had seen them all about me.

He never so much as asked me about my fortune or estate, but assured me
that when we came to Dublin he would jointure me in #600 a year good
land; and that we could enter into a deed of settlement or contract
here for the performance of it.

This was such language indeed as I had not been used to, and I was here
beaten out of all my measures; I had a she-devil in my bosom, every
hour telling me how great her brother lived.  One time she would come
for my orders, how I would have my coaches painted, and how lined; and
another time what clothes my page should wear; in short, my eyes were
dazzled.  I had now lost my power of saying No, and, to cut the story
short, I consented to be married; but to be the more private, we were
carried farther into the country, and married by a Romish clergyman,
who I was assured would marry us as effectually as a Church of England
parson.

I cannot say but I had some reflections in this affair upon the
dishonourable forsaking my faithful citizen, who loved me sincerely,
and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous whore by whom
he had been indeed barbarously used, and promised himself infinite
happiness in his new choice; which choice was now giving up herself to
another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be.

But the glittering shoe of a great estate, and of fine things, which
the deceived creature that was now my deceiver represented every hour
to my imagination, hurried me away, and gave me no time to think of
London, or of anything there, much less of the obligation I had to a
person of infinitely more real merit than what was now before me.

But the thing was done; I was now in the arms of my new spouse, who
appeared still the same as before; great even to magnificence, and
nothing less than #1000 a year could support the ordinary equipage he
appeared in.

After we had been married about a month, he began to talk of my going
to West Chester in order to embark for Ireland.  However, he did not
hurry me, for we stayed near three weeks longer, and then he sent to
Chester for a coach to meet us at the Black Rock, as they call it, over
against Liverpool.  Thither we went in a fine boat they call a pinnace,
with six oars; his servants, and horses, and baggage going in the
ferry-boat.  He made his excuse to me that he had no acquaintance in
Chester, but he would go before and get some handsome apartment for me
at a private house.  I asked him how long we should stay at Chester.
He said, not at all, any longer than one night or two, but he would
immediately hire a coach to go to Holyhead.  Then I told him he should
by no means give himself the trouble to get private lodgings for one
night or two, for that Chester being a great place, I made no doubt but
there would be very good inns and accommodation enough; so we lodged at
an inn in the West Street, not far from the Cathedral; I forget what
sign it was at.

Here my spouse, talking of my going to Ireland, asked me if I had no
affairs to settle at London before we went off.  I told him No, not of
any great consequence, but what might be done as well by letter from
Dublin.  'Madam,' says he, very respectfully, 'I suppose the greatest
part of your estate, which my sister tells me is most of it in money in
the Bank of England, lies secure enough, but in case it required
transferring, or any way altering its property, it might be necessary
to go up to London and settle those things before we went over.'

I seemed to look strange at it, and told him I knew not what he meant;
that I had no effects in the Bank of England that I knew of; and I
hoped he could not say that I had ever told him I had.  No, he said, I
had not told him so, but his sister had said the greatest part of my
estate lay there.  'And I only mentioned it, me dear,' said he, 'that
if there was any occasion to settle it, or order anything about it, we
might not be obliged to the hazard and trouble of another voyage back
again'; for he added, that he did not care to venture me too much upon
the sea.

I was surprised at this talk, and began to consider very seriously what
the meaning of it must be; and it presently occurred to me that my
friend, who called him brother, had represented me in colours which
were not my due; and I thought, since it was come to that pitch, that I
would know the bottom of it before I went out of England, and before I
should put myself into I knew not whose hands in a strange country.

Upon this I called his sister into my chamber the next morning, and
letting her know the discourse her brother and I had been upon the
evening before, I conjured her to tell me what she had said to him, and
upon what foot it was that she had made this marriage.  She owned that
she had told him that I was a great fortune, and said that she was told
so at London.  'Told so!' says I warmly; 'did I ever tell you so?'  No,
she said, it was true I did not tell her so, but I had said several
times that what I had was in my own disposal.  'I did so,' returned I
very quickly and hastily, 'but I never told you I had anything called a
fortune; no, not that I had #100, or the value of #100, in the world.
Any how did it consist with my being a fortune,' said I, 'that I should
come here into the north of England with you, only upon the account of
living cheap?' At these words, which I spoke warm and high, my husband,
her brother (as she called him), came into the room, and I desired him
to come and sit down, for I had something of moment to say before them
both, which it was absolutely necessary he should hear.

He looked a little disturbed at the assurance with which I seemed to
speak it, and came and sat down by me, having first shut the door; upon
which I began, for I was very much provoked, and turning myself to him,
'I am afraid,' says I, 'my dear' (for I spoke with kindness on his
side), 'that you have a very great abuse put upon you, and an injury
done you never to be repaired in your marrying me, which, however, as I
have had no hand in it, I desire I may be fairly acquitted of it, and
that the blame may lie where it ought to lie, and nowhere else, for I
wash my hands of every part of it.'

'What injury can be done me, my dear,' says he, 'in marrying you.  I
hope it is to my honour and advantage every way.'  'I will soon explain
it to you,' says I, 'and I fear you will have no reason to think
yourself well used; but I will convince you, my dear,' says I again,
'that I have had no hand in it'; and there I stopped a while.

He looked now scared and wild, and began, I believe, to suspect what
followed; however, looking towards me, and saying only, 'Go on,' he sat
silent, as if to hear what I had more to say; so I went on.  'I asked
you last night,' said I, speaking to him, 'if ever I made any boast to
you of my estate, or ever told you I had any estate in the Bank of
England or anywhere else, and you owned I had not, as is most true; and
I desire you will tell me here, before your sister, if ever I gave you
any reason from me to think so, or that ever we had any discourse about
it'; and he owned again I had not, but said I had appeared always as a
woman of fortune, and he depended on it that I was so, and hoped he was
not deceived.  'I am not inquiring yet whether you have been deceived
or not,' said I; 'I fear you have, and I too; but I am clearing myself
from the unjust charge of being concerned in deceiving you.

'I have been now asking your sister if ever I told her of any fortune
or estate I had, or gave her any particulars of it; and she owns I
never did.  Any pray, madam,' said I, turning myself to her, 'be so
just to me, before your brother, to charge me, if you can, if ever I
pretended to you that I had an estate; and why, if I had, should I come
down into this country with you on purpose to spare that little I had,
and live cheap?'  She could not deny one word, but said she had been
told in London that I had a very great fortune, and that it lay in the
Bank of England.

'And now, dear sir,' said I, turning myself to my new spouse again, 'be
so just to me as to tell me who has abused both you and me so much as
to make you believe I was a fortune, and prompt you to court me to this
marriage?'  He could not speak a word, but pointed to her; and, after
some more pause, flew out in the most furious passion that ever I saw a
man in my life, cursing her, and calling her all the whores and hard
names he could think of; and that she had ruined him, declaring that
she had told him I had #15,000, and that she was to have #500 of him
for procuring this match for him.  He then added, directing his speech
to memy life in her hands, and so I did, for I let her know where to
send to me, and had several letters from her while I stayed here.  Some
of them almost scared me out my wits but at last she sent me the joyful
news that he was hanged, which was the best news to me that I had heard
a great while.

I had stayed here five weeks, and lived very comfortably indeed (the
secret anxiety of my mind excepted); but when I received this letter I
looked pleasantly again, and told my landlady that I had received a
letter from my spouse in Ireland, that I had the good news of his being
very well, but had the bad news that his business would not permit him
to come away so soon as he expected, and so I was like to go back again
without him.

My landlady complimented me upon the good news however, that I had
heard he was well.  'For I have observed, madam,' says she, 'you hadn't
been so pleasant as you used to be; you have been over head and ears in
care for him, I dare say,' says the good woman; ''tis easy to be seen
there's an alteration in you for the better,' says she.  'Well, I am
sorry the esquire can't come yet,' says my landlord; 'I should have
been heartily glad to have seen him.  But I hope, when you have certain
news of his coming, you'll take a step hither again, madam,' says he;
'you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come.'

With all these fine compliments we parted, and I came merry enough to
London, and found my governess as well pleased as I was.  And now she
told me she would never recommend any partner to me again, for she
always found, she said, that I had the best luck when I ventured by
myself.  And so indeed I had, for I was seldom in any danger when I was
by myself, or if I was, I got out of it with more dexterity than when I
was entangled with the dull measures of other people, who had perhaps
less forecast, and were more rash and impatient than I; for though I
had as much courage to venture as any of them, yet I used more caution
before I undertook a thing, and had more presence of mind when I was to
bring myself off.

I have often wondered even at my own hardiness another way, that when
all my companions were surprised and fell so suddenly into the hand of
justice, and that I so narrowly escaped, yet I could not all this while
enter into one serious resolution to leave off this trade, and
especially considering that I was now very far from being poor; that
the temptation of necessity, which is generally the introduction of all
such wickedness, was now removed; for I had near #500 by me in ready
money, on which I might have lived very well, if I had thought fit to
have retired; but I say, I had not so much as the least inclination to
leave off; no, not so much as I had before when I had but #200
beforehand, and when I had no such frightful examples before my eyes as
these were.  From hence 'tis evident to me, that when once we are
hardened in crime, no fear can affect us, no example give us any
warning.

I had indeed one comrade whose fate went very near me for a good while,
though I wore it off too in time.  That case was indeed very unhappy.
I had made a prize of a piece of very good damask in a mercer's shop,
and went clear off myself, but had conveyed the piece to this companion
of mine when we went out of the shop, and she went one way and I went
another.  We had not been long out of the shop but the mercer missed
his piece of stuff, and sent his messengers, one one way and one
another, and they presently seized her that had the piece, with the
damask upon her.  As for me, I had very luckily stepped into a house
where there was a lace chamber, up one pair of stairs, and had the
satisfaction, or the terror indeed, of looking out of the window upon
the noise they made, and seeing the poor creature dragged away in
triumph to the justice, who immediately committed her to Newgate.

I was careful to attempt nothing in the lace chamber, but tumbled their
goods pretty much to spend time; then bought a few yards of edging and
paid for it, and came away very sad-hearted indeed for the poor woman,
who was in tribulation for what I only had stolen.

Here again my old caution stood me in good stead; namely, that though I
often robbed with these people, yet I never let them know who I was, or
where I lodged, nor could they ever find out my lodging, though they
often endeavoured to watch me to it.  They all knew me by the name of
Moll Flanders, though even some of them rather believed I was she than
knew me to be so.  My name was public among them indeed, but how to
find me out they knew not, nor so much as how to guess at my quarters,
whether they were at the east end of the town or the west; and this
wariness was my safety upon all these occasions.

I kept close a great while upon the occasion of this woman's disaster.
I knew that if I should do anything that should miscarry, and should be
carried to prison, she would be there and ready to witness against me,
and perhaps save her life at my expense.  I considered that I began to
be very well known by name at the Old Bailey, though they did not know
my face, and that if I should fall into their hands, I should be
treated as an old offender; and for this reason I was resolved to see
what this poor creature's fate should be before I stirred abroad,
though several times in her distress I conveyed money to her for her
relief.

At length she came to her trial.  She pleaded she did not steal the
thing, but that one Mrs. Flanders, as she heard her called (for she did
not know her), gave the bundle to her after they came out of the shop,
and bade her carry it home to her lodging.  They asked her where this
Mrs. Flanders was, but she could not produce her, neither could she
give the least account of me; and the mercer's men swearing positively
that she was in the shop when the goods were stolen, that they
immediately missed them, and pursued her, and found them upon her,
thereupon the jury brought her in guilty; but the Court, considering
that she was really not the person that stole the goods, an inferior
assistant, and that it was very possible she could not find out this
Mrs. Flanders, meaning me, though it would save her life, which indeed
was true--I say, considering all this, they allowed her to be
transported, which was the utmost favour she could obtain, only that
the Court told her that if she could in the meantime produce the said
Mrs. Flanders, they would intercede for her pardon; that is to say, if
she could find me out, and hand me, she should not be transported.
This I took care to make impossible to her, and so she was shipped off
in pursuance of her sentence a little while after.

I must repeat it again, that the fate of this poor woman troubled me
exceedingly, and I began to be very pensive, knowing that I was really
the instrument of her disaster; but the preservation of my own life,
which was so evidently in danger, took off all my tenderness; and
seeing that she was not put to death, I was very easy at her
transportation, because she was then out of the way of doing me any
mischief, whatever should happen.

The disaster of this woman was some months before that of the
last-recited story, and was indeed partly occasion of my governess
proposing to dress me up in men's clothes, that I might go about
unobserved, as indeed I did; but I was soon tired of that disguise, as
I have said, for indeed it exposed me to too many difficulties.

I was now easy as to all fear of witnesses against me, for all those
that had either been concerned with me, or that knew me by the name of
Moll Flanders, were either hanged or transported; and if I should have
had the misfortune to be taken, I might call myself anything else, as
well as Moll Flanders, and no old sins could be placed into my account;
so I began to run a-tick again with the more freedom, and several
successful adventures I made, though not such as I had made before.

We had at that time another fire happened not a great way off from the
place where my governess lived, and I made an attempt there, as before,
but as I was not soon enough before the crowd of people came in, and
could not get to the house I aimed at, instead of a prize, I got a
mischief, which had almost put a period to my life and all my wicked
doings together; for the fire being very furious, and the people in a
great fright in removing their goods, and throwing them out of window,
a wench from out of a window threw a feather-bed just upon me.  It is
true, the bed being soft, it broke no bones; but as the weight was
great, and made greater by the fall, it beat me down, and laid me dead
for a while.  Nor did the people concern themselves much to deliver me
from it, or to recover me at all; but I lay like one dead and neglected
a good while, till somebody going to remove the bed out of the way,
helped me up.  It was indeed a wonder the people in the house had not
thrown other goods out after it, and which might have fallen upon it,
and then I had been inevitably killed; but I was reserved for further
afflictions.

This accident, however, spoiled my market for that time, and I came
home to my governess very much hurt and bruised, and frighted to the
last degree, and it was a good while before she could set me upon my
feet again.

It was now a merry time of the year, and Bartholomew Fair was begun.  I
had never made any walks that way, nor was the common part of the fair
of much advantage to me; but I took a turn this year into the
cloisters, and among the rest I fell into one of the raffling shops.
It was a thing of no great consequence to me, nor did I expect to make
much of it; but there came a gentleman extremely well dressed and very
rich, and as 'tis frequent to talk to everybody in those shops, he
singled me out, and was very particular with me.  First he told me he
would put in for me to raffle, and did so; and some small matter coming
to his lot, he presented it to me (I think it was a feather muff); then
he continued to keep talking to me with a more than common appearance
of respect, but still very civil, and much like a gentleman.

He held me in talk so long, till at last he drew me out of the raffling
place to the shop-door, and then to a walk in the cloister, still
talking of a thousand things cursorily without anything to the purpose.
At last he told me that, without compliment, he was charmed with my
company, and asked me if I durst trust myself in a coach with him; he
told me he was a man of honour, and would not offer anything to me
unbecoming him as such.  I seemed to decline it a while, but suffered
myself to be importuned a little, and then yielded.

I was at a loss in my thoughts to conclude at first what this gentleman
designed; but I found afterwards he had had some drink in his head, and
that he was not very unwilling to have some more.  He carried me in the
coach to the Spring Garden, at Knightsbridge, where we walked in the
gardens, and he treated me very handsomely; but I found he drank very
freely.  He pressed me also to drink, but I declined it.

Hitherto he kept his word with me, and offered me nothing amiss.  We
came away in the coach again, and he brought me into the streets, and
by this time it was near ten o'clock at night, and he stopped the coach
at a house where, it seems, he was acquainted, and where they made no
scruple to show us upstairs into a room with a bed in it.  At first I
seemed to be unwilling to go up, but after a few words I yielded to
that too, being willing to see the end of it, and in hope to make
something of it at last.  As for the bed, etc., I was not much
concerned about that part.

Here he began to be a little freer with me than he had promised; and I
by little and little yielded to everything, so that, in a word, he did
what he pleased with me; I need say no more.  All this while he drank
freely too, and about one in the morning we went into the coach again.
The air and the shaking of the coach made the drink he had get more up
in his head than it was before, and he grew uneasy in the coach, and
was for acting over again what he had been doing before; but as I
thought my game now secure, I resisted him, and brought him to be a
little still, which had not lasted five minutes but he fell fast asleep.

I took this opportunity to search him to a nicety.  I took a gold
watch, with a silk purse of gold, his fine full-bottom periwig and
silver-fringed gloves, his sword and fine snuff-box, and gently opening
the coach door, stood ready to jump out while the coach was going on;
but the coach stopped in the narrow street beyond Temple Bar to let
another coach pass, I got softly out, fastened the door again, and gave
my gentleman and the coach the slip both together, and never heard more
of them.

This was an adventure indeed unlooked for, and perfectly undesigned by
me; though I was not so past the merry part of life, as to forget how
to behave, when a fop so blinded by his appetite should not know an old
woman from a young.  I did not indeed look so old as I was by ten or
twelve years; yet I was not a young wench of seventeen, and it was easy
enough to be distinguished.  There is nothing so absurd, so surfeiting,
so ridiculous, as a man heated by wine in his head, and wicked gust in
his inclination together; he is in the possession of two devils at
once, and can no more govern himself by his reason than a mill can
grind without water; his vice tramples upon all that was in him that
had any good in it, if any such thing there was; nay, his very sense is
blinded by its own rage, and he acts absurdities even in his views;
such a drinking more, when he is drunk already; picking up a common
woman, without regard to what she is or who she is, whether sound or
rotten, clean or unclean, whether ugly or handsome, whether old or
young, and so blinded as not really to distinguish.  Such a man is
worse than a lunatic; prompted by his vicious, corrupted head, he no
more knows what he is doing than this wretch of mine knew when I picked
his pocket of his watch and his purse of gold.

These are the men of whom Solomon says, 'They go like an ox to the
slaughter, till a dart strikes through their liver'; an admirable
description, by the way, of the foul disease, which is a poisonous
deadly contagion mingling with the blood, whose centre or foundation is
in the liver; from whence, by the swift circulation of the whole mass,
that dreadful nauseous plague strikes immediately through his liver,
and his spirits are infected, his vitals stabbed through as with a dart.

It is true this poor unguarded wretch was in no danger from me, though
I was greatly apprehensive at first of what danger I might be in from
him; but he was really to be pitied in one respect, that he seemed to
be a good sort of man in himself; a gentleman that had no harm in his
design; a man of sense, and of a fine behaviour, a comely handsome
person, a sober solid countenance, a charming beautiful face, and
everything that could be agreeable; only had unhappily had some drink
the night before, had not been in bed, as he told me when we were
together; was hot, and his blood fired with wine, and in that condition
his reason, as it were asleep, had given him up.

As for me, my business was his money, and what I could make of him; and
after that, if I could have found out any way to have done it, I would
have sent him safe home to his house and to his family, for 'twas ten
to one but he had an honest, virtuous wife and innocent children, that
were anxious for his safety, and would have been glad to have gotten
him home, and have taken care of him till he was restored to himself.
And then with what shame and regret would he look back upon himself!
how would he reproach himself with associating himself with a whore!
picked up in the worst of all holes, the cloister, among the dirt and
filth of all the town! how would he be trembling for fear he had got
the pox, for fear a dart had struck through his liver, and hate himself
every time he looked back upon the madness and brutality of his
debauch! how would he, if he had any principles of honour, as I verily
believe he had--I say, how would he abhor the thought of giving any ill
distemper, if he had it, as for aught he knew he might, to his modest
and virtuous wife, and thereby sowing the contagion in the life-blood
of his posterity.

Would such gentlemen but consider the contemptible thoughts which the
very women they are concerned with, in such cases as these, have of
them, it would be a surfeit to them.  As I said above, they value not
the pleasure, they are raised by no inclination to the man, the passive
jade thinks of no pleasure but the money; and when he is, as it were,
drunk in the ecstasies of his wicked pleasure, her hands are in his
pockets searching for what she can find there, and of which he can no
more be sensible in the moment of his folly that he can forethink of it
when he goes about it.

I knew a woman that was so dexterous with a fellow, who indeed deserved
no better usage, that while he was busy with her another way, conveyed
his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fob-pocket, where he had
put it for fear of her, and put another purse with gilded counters in
it into the room of it.  After he had done, he says to her, 'Now han't
you picked my pocket?'  She jested with him, and told him she supposed
he had not much to lose; he put his hand to his fob, and with his
fingers felt that his purse was there, which fully satisfied him, and
so she brought off his money.  And this was a trade with her; she kept
a sham gold watch, that is, a watch of silver gilt, and a purse of
counters in her pocket to be ready on all such occasions, and I doubt
not practiced it with success.

I came home with this last booty to my governess, and really when I
told her the story, it so affected her that she was hardly able to
forbear tears, to know how such a gentleman ran a daily risk of being
undone every time a glass of wine got into his head.

But as to the purchase I got, and how entirely I stripped him, she told
me it pleased her wonderfully.  'Nay child,' says she, 'the usage may,
for aught I know, do more to reform him than all the sermons that ever
he will hear in his life.'  And if the remainder of the story be true,
so it did.

I found the next day she was wonderful inquisitive about this
gentleman; the description I had given her of him, his dress, his
person, his face, everything concurred to make her think of a gentleman
whose character she knew, and family too.  She mused a while, and I
going still on with the particulars, she starts up; says she, 'I'll lay
#100 I know the gentleman.'

'I am sorry you do,' says I, 'for I would not have him exposed on any
account in the world; he has had injury enough already by me, and I
would not be instrumental to do him any more.' 'No, no,' says she, 'I
will do him no injury, I assure you, but you may let me satisfy my
curiosity a little, for if it is he, I warrant you I find it out.'  I
was a little startled at that, and told her, with an apparent concern
in my face, that by the same rule he might find me out, and then I was
undone.  She returned warmly, 'Why, do you think I will betray you,
child?  No, no,' says she, 'not for all he is worth in the world.  I
have kept your counsel in worse things than these; sure you may trust
me in this.'  So I said no more at that time.

She laid her scheme another way, and without acquainting me of it, but
she was resolved to find it out if possible.  So she goes to a certain
friend of hers who was acquainted in the family that she guessed at,
and told her friend she had some extraordinary business with such a
gentleman (who, by the way, was no less than a baronet, and of a very
good family), and that she knew not how to come at him without somebody
to introduce her.  Her friend promised her very readily to do it, and
accordingly goes to the house to see if the gentleman was in town.

The next day she come to my governess and tells her that Sir ---- was
at home, but that he had met with a disaster and was very ill, and
there was no speaking with him.  'What disaster?' says my governess
hastily, as if she was surprised at it.  'Why,' says her friend, 'he
had been at Hampstead to visit a gentleman of his acquaintance, and as
he came back again he was set upon and robbed; and having got a little
drink too, as they suppose, the rogues abused him, and he is very ill.'
'Robbed!' says my governess, 'and what did they take from him?'  'Why,'
says her friend, 'they took his gold watch and his gold snuff-box, his
fine periwig, and what money he had in his pocket, which was
considerable, to be sure, for Sir ---- never goes without a purse of
guineas about him.'

'Pshaw!' says my old governess, jeering, 'I warrant you he has got
drunk now and got a whore, and she has picked his pocket, and so he
comes home to his wife and tells her he has been robbed.  That's an old
sham; a thousand such tricks are put upon the poor women every day.'

'Fie!' says her friend, 'I find you don't know Sir ----; why he is as
civil a gentleman, there is not a finer man, nor a soberer, graver,
modester person in the whole city; he abhors such things; there's
nobody that knows him will think such a thing of him.' 'Well, well,'
says my governess, 'that's none of my business; if it was, I warrant I
should find there was something of that kind in it; your modest men in
common opinion are sometimes no better than other people, only they
keep a better character, or, if you please, are the better hypocrites.'

'No, no,' says her friend, 'I can assure you Sir ---- is no hypocrite,
he is really an honest, sober gentleman, and he has certainly been
robbed.'  'Nay,' says my governess, 'it may be he has; it is no
business of mine, I tell you; I only want to speak with him; my
business is of another nature.'  'But,' says her friend, 'let your
business be of what nature it will, you cannot see him yet, for he is
not fit to be seen, for he is very ill, and bruised very much,'  'Ay,'
says my governess, 'nay, then he has fallen into bad hands, to be
sure,'  And then she asked gravely, 'Pray, where is he bruised?'  'Why,
in the head,' says her friend, 'and one of his hands, and his face, for
they used him barbarously.'  'Poor gentleman,' says my governess, 'I
must wait, then, till he recovers'; and adds, 'I hope it will not be
long, for I want very much to speak with him.'

Away she comes to me and tells me this story.  'I have found out your
fine gentleman, and a fine gentleman he was,' says she; 'but, mercy on
him, he is in a sad pickle now.  I wonder what the d--l you have done
to him; why, you have almost killed him.'  I looked at her with
disorder enough.  'I killed him!' says I; 'you must mistake the person;
I am sure I did nothing to him; he was very well when I left him,' said
I, 'only drunk and fast asleep.'  'I know nothing of that,' says she,
'but he is in a sad pickle now'; and so she told me all that her friend
had said to her.  'Well, then,' says I, 'he fell into bad hands after I
left him, for I am sure I left him safe enough.'

About ten days after, or a little more, my governess goes again to her
friend, to introduce her to this gentleman; she had inquired other ways
in the meantime, and found that he was about again, if not abroad
again, so she got leave to speak with him.

She was a woman of a admirable address, and wanted nobody to introduce
her; she told her tale much better than I shall be able to tell it for
her, for she was a mistress of her tongue, as I have said already.  She
told him that she came, though a stranger, with a single design of
doing him a service and he should find she had no other end in it; that
as she came purely on so friendly an account, she begged promise from
him, that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose he
would not take it ill that she meddled with what was not her business.
She assured him that as what she had to say was a secret that belonged
to him only, so whether he accepted her offer or not, it should remain
a secret to all the world, unless he exposed it himself; nor should his
refusing her service in it make her so little show her respect as to do
him the least injury, so that he should be entirely at liberty to act
as he thought fit.

He looked very shy at first, and said he knew nothing that related to
him that required much secrecy; that he had never done any man any
wrong, and cared not what anybody might say of him; that it was no part
of his character to be unjust to anybody, nor could he imagine in what
any man could render him any service; but that if it was so
disinterested a service as she said, he could not take it ill from any
one that they should endeavour to serve him; and so, as it were, left
her a liberty either to tell him or not to tell, as she thought fit.

She found him so perfectly indifferent, that she was almost afraid to
enter into the point with him; but, however, after some other
circumlocutions she told him that by a strange and unaccountable
accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy
adventure he had fallen into, and that in such a manner, that there was
nobody in the world but herself and him that were acquainted with it,
no, not the very person that was with him.

He looked a little angrily at first.  'What adventure?' said he.
'Why,' said she, 'of your being robbed coming from Knightbr----;
Hampstead, sir, I should say,' says she.  'Be not surprised, sir,' says
she, 'that I am able to tell you every step you took that day from the
cloister in Smithfield to the Spring Garden at Knightsbridge, and
thence to the ---- in the Strand, and how you were left asleep in the
coach afterwards.  I say, let not this surprise you, for, sir, I do not
come to make a booty of you, I ask nothing of you, and I assure you the
woman that was with you knows nothing who you are, and never shall; and
yet perhaps I may serve you further still, for I did not come barely to
let you know that I was informed of these things, as if I wanted a
bribe to conceal them; assure yourself, sir,' said she, 'that whatever
you think fit to do or say to me, it shall be all a secret as it is, as
much as if I were in my grave.'

He was astonished at her discourse, and said gravely to her, 'Madam,
you are a stranger to me, but it is very unfortunate that you should be
let into the secret of the worst action of my life, and a thing that I
am so justly ashamed of, that the only satisfaction of it to me was,
that I thought it was known only to God and my own conscience.'  'Pray,
sir,' says she, 'do not reckon the discovery of it to me to be any part
of your misfortune.  It was a thing, I believe, you were surprised
into, and perhaps the woman used some art to prompt you to it; however,
you will never find any just cause,' said she, 'to repent that I came
to hear of it; nor can your own mouth be more silent in it that I have
been, and ever shall be.'

'Well,' says he, 'but let me do some justice to the woman too; whoever
she is, I do assure you she prompted me to nothing, she rather declined
me.  It was my own folly and madness that brought me into it all, ay,
and brought her into it too; I must give her her due so far.  As to
what she took from me, I could expect no less from her in the condition
I was in, and to this hour I know not whether she robbed me or the
coachman; if she did it, I forgive her, and I think all gentlemen that
do so should be used in the same manner; but I am more concerned for
some other things that I am for all that she took from me.'

My governess now began to come into the whole matter, and he opened
himself freely to her.  First she said to him, in answer to what he had
said about me, 'I am glad, sir, you are so just to the person that you
were with; I assure you she is a gentlewoman, and no woman of the town;
and however you prevailed with her so far as you did, I am sure 'tis
not her practice.  You ran a great venture indeed, sir; but if that be
any part of your care, I am persuaded you may be perfectly easy, for I
dare assure you no man has touched her, before you, since her husband,
and he has been dead now almost eight years.'

It appeared that this was his grievance, and that he was in a very
great fright about it; however, when my governess said this to him, he
appeared very well pleased, and said, 'Well, madam, to be plain with
you, if I was satisfied of that, I should not so much value what I
lost; for, as to that, the temptation was great, and perhaps she was
poor and wanted it.'  'If she had not been poor, sir ----,' says my
governess, 'I assure you she would never have yielded to you; and as
her poverty first prevailed with her to let you do as you did, so the
same poverty prevailed with her to pay herself at last, when she saw
you were in such a condition, that if she had not done it, perhaps the
next coachman might have done it.'

'Well,' says he, 'much good may it do her.  I say again, all the
gentlemen that do so ought to be used in the same manner, and then they
would be cautious of themselves.  I have no more concern about it, but
on the score which you hinted at before, madam.'  Here he entered into
some freedoms with her on the subject of what passed between us, which
are not so proper for a woman to write, and the great terror that was
upon his mind with relation to his wife, for fear he should have
received any injury from me, and should communicate if farther; and
asked her at last if she could not procure him an opportunity to speak
with me.  My governess gave him further assurances of my being a woman
clear from any such thing, and that he was as entirely safe in that
respect as he was with his own lady; but as for seeing me, she said it
might be of dangerous consequence; but, however, that she would talk
with me, and let him know my answer, using at the same time some
arguments to persuade him not to desire it, and that it could be of no
service to him, seeing she hoped he had no desire to renew a
correspondence with me, and that on my account it was a kind of putting
my life in his hands.

He told her he had a great desire to see me, that he would give her any
assurances that were in his power, not to take any advantages of me,
and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all
demands of any kind.  She insisted how it might tend to a further
divulging the secret, and might in the end be injurious to him,
entreating him not to press for it; so at length  he desisted.

They had some discourse upon the subject of the things he had lost, and
he seemed to be very desirous of his gold watch, and told her if she
could procure that for him, he would willingly give as much for it as
it was worth.  She told him she would endeavour to procure it for him,
and leave the valuing it to himself.

Accordingly the next day she carried the watch, and he gave her thirty
guineas for it, which was more than I should have been able to make of
it, though it seems it cost much more.  He spoke something of his
periwig, which it seems cost him threescore guineas, and his snuff-box,
and in a few days more she carried them too; which obliged him very
much, and he gave her thirty more.  The next day I sent him his fine
sword and cane gratis, and demanded nothing of him, but I had no mind
to see him, unless it had been so that he might be satisfied I knew who
he was, which he was not willing to.

Then he entered into a long talk with her of the manner how she came to
know all this matter.  She formed a long tale of that part; how she had
it from one that I had told the whole story to, and that was to help me
dispose of the goods; and this confidante brought the things to her,
she being by profession a pawnbroker; and she hearing of his worship's
disaster, guessed at the thing in general; that having gotten the
things into her hands, she had resolved to come and try as she had
done.  She then gave him repeated assurances that it should never go
out of her mouth, and though she knew the woman very well, yet she had
not let her know, meaning me, anything of it; that is to say, who the
person was, which, by the way, was false; but, however, it was not to
his damage, for I never opened my mouth of it to anybody.

I had a great many thoughts in my head about my seeing him again, and
was often sorry that I had refused it.  I was persuaded that if I had
seen him, and let him know that I knew him, I should have made some
advantage of him, and perhaps have had some maintenance from him; and
though it was a life wicked enough, yet it was not so full of danger as
this I was engaged in.  However, those thoughts wore off, and I
declined seeing him again, for that time; but my governess saw him
often, and he was very kind to her, giving her something almost every
time he saw her.  One time in particular she found him very merry, and
as she thought he had some wine in his head, and he pressed her again
very earnestly to let him see that woman that, as he said, had
bewitched him so that night, my governess, who was from the beginning
for my seeing him, told him he was so desirous of it that she could
almost yield of it, if she could prevail upon me; adding that if he
would please to come to her house in the evening, she would endeavour
it, upon his repeated assurances of forgetting what was past.

Accordingly she came to me, and told me all the discourse; in short,
she soon biassed me to consent, in a case which I had some regret in my
mind for declining before; so I prepared to see him.  I dressed me to
all the advantage possible, I assure you, and for the first time used a
little art; I say for the first time, for I had never yielded to the
baseness of paint before, having always had vanity enough to believe I
had no need of it.

At the hour appointed he came; and as she observed before, so it was
plain still, that he had been drinking, though very far from what we
call being in drink.  He appeared exceeding pleased to see me, and
entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair.  I begged
his pardon very often for my share of it, protested I had not any such
design when first I met him, that I had not gone out with him but that
I took him for a very civil gentleman, and that he made me so many
promises of offering no uncivility to me.

He alleged the wine he drank, and that he scarce knew what he did, and
that if it had not been so, I should never have let him take the
freedom with me that he had done.  He protested to me that he never
touched any woman but me since he was married to his wife, and it was a
surprise upon him; complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable
to him, and the like; and talked so much of that kind, till I found he
had talked himself almost into a temper to do the same thing over
again.  But I took him up short.  I protested I had never suffered any
man to touch me since my husband died, which was near eight years.  He
said he believed it to be so truly; and added that madam had intimated
as much to him, and that it was his opinion of that part which made his
desire to see me again; and that since he had once broke in upon his
virtue with me, and found no ill consequences, he could be safe in
venturing there again; and so, in short, it went on to what I expected,
and to what will not bear relating.

My old governess had foreseen it, as well as I, and therefore led him
into a room which had not a bed in it, and yet had a chamber within it
which had a bed, whither we withdrew for the rest of the night; and, in
short, after some time being together, he went to bed, and lay there
all night.  I withdrew, but came again undressed in the morning, before
it was day, and lay with him the rest of the time.

Thus, you see, having committed a crime once is a sad handle to the
committing of it again; whereas all the regret and reflections wear off
when the temptation renews itself.  Had I not yielded to see him again,
the corrupt desire in him had worn off, and 'tis very probable he had
never fallen into it with anybody else, as I really believe he had not
done before.

When he went away, I told him I hoped he was satisfied he had not been
robbed again.  He told me he was satisfied in that point, and could
trust me again, and putting his hand in his pocket, gave me five
guineas, which was the first money I had gained that way for many years.

I had several visits of the like kind from him, but he never came into
a settled way of maintenance, which was what I would have best pleased
with.  Once, indeed, he asked me how I did to live.  I answered him
pretty quick, that I assured him I had never taken that course that I
took with him, but that indeed I worked at my needle, and could just
maintain myself; that sometime it was as much as I was able to do, and
I shifted hard enough.

He seemed to reflect upon himself that he should be the first person to
lead me into that, which he assured me he never intended to do himself;
and it touched him a little, he said, that he should be the cause of
his own sin and mine too.  He would often make just reflections also
upon the crime itself, and upon the particular circumstances of it with
respect to himself; how wine introduced the inclinations how the devil
led him to the place, and found out an object to tempt him, and he made
the moral always himself.

When these thoughts were upon him he would go away, and perhaps not
come again in a month's time or longer; but then as the serious part
wore off, the lewd part would wear in, and then he came prepared for
the wicked part.  Thus we lived for some time; thought he did not keep,
as they call it, yet he never failed doing things that were handsome,
and sufficient to maintain me without working, and, which was better,
without following my old trade.

But this affair had its end too; for after about a year, I found that
he did not come so often as usual, and at last he left if off
altogether without any dislike to bidding adieu; and so there was an
end of that short scene of life, which added no great store to me, only
to make more work for repentance.

However, during this interval I confined myself pretty much at home; at
least, being thus provided for, I made no adventures, no, not for a
quarter of a year after he left me; but then finding the fund fail, and
being loth to spend upon the main stock, I began to think of my old
trade, and to look abroad into the street again; and my first step was
lucky enough.

I had dressed myself up in a very mean habit, for as I had several
shapes to appear in, I was now in an ordinary stuff-gown, a blue apron,
and a straw hat and I placed myself at the door of the Three Cups Inn
in St. John Street.  There were several carriers used the inn, and the
stage-coaches for Barnet, for Totteridge, and other towns that way
stood always in the street in the evening, when they prepared to set
out, so that I was ready for anything that offered, for either one or
other.  The meaning was this; people come frequently with bundles and
small parcels to those inns, and call for such carriers or coaches as
they want, to carry them into the country; and there generally attend
women, porters' wives or daughters, ready to take in such things for
their respective people that employ them.

It happened very oddly that I was standing at the inn gate, and a woman
that had stood there before, and which was the porter's wife belonging
to the Barnet stage-coach, having observed me, asked if I waited for
any of the coaches.  I told her Yes, I waited for my mistress, that was
coming to go to Barnet.  She asked me who was my mistress, and I told
her any madam's name that came next me; but as it seemed, I happened
upon a name, a family of which name lived at Hadley, just beyond Barnet.

I said no more to her, or she to me, a good while; but by and by,
somebody calling her at a door a little way off, she desired me that if
anybody called for the Barnet coach, I would step and call her at the
house, which it seems was an alehouse.  I said Yes, very readily, and
away she went.

She was no sooner gone but comes a wench and a child, puffing and
sweating, and asks for the Barnet coach.  I answered presently, 'Here.'
'Do you belong to the Barnet coach?' says she.  'Yes, sweetheart,' said
I; 'what do ye want?'  'I want room for two passengers,' says she.
'Where are they, sweetheart?' said I.  'Here's this girl, pray let her
go into the coach,' says she, 'and I'll go and fetch my mistress.'
'Make haste, then, sweetheart,' says I, 'for we may be full else.'  The
maid had a great bundle under her arm; so she put the child into the
coach, and I said, 'You had best put your bundle into the coach too.'
'No,' says she, 'I am afraid somebody should slip it away from the
child.'  'Give to me, then,' said I, 'and I'll take care of it.'  'Do,
then,' says she, 'and be sure you take of it.'  'I'll answer for it,'
said I, 'if it were for #20 value.'  'There, take it, then,' says she,
and away she goes.

As soon as I had got the bundle, and the maid was out of sight, I goes
on towards the alehouse, where the porter's wife was, so that if I had
met her, I had then only been going to give her the bundle, and to call
her to her business, as if I was going away, and could stay no longer;
but as I did not meet her, I walked away, and turning into Charterhouse
Lane, then crossed into Batholomew Close, so into Little Britain, and
through the Bluecoat Hospital, into Newgate Street.

To prevent my being known, I pulled off my blue apron, and wrapped the
bundle in it, which before was made up in a piece of painted calico,
and very remarkable; I also wrapped up my straw hat in it, and so put
the bundle upon my head; and it was very well that I did thus, for
coming through the Bluecoat Hospital, who should I meet but the wench
that had given me the bundle to hold.  It seems she was going with her
mistress, whom she had been gone to fetch, to the Barnet coaches.

I saw she was in haste, and I had no business to stop her; so away she
went, and I brought my bundle safe home to my governess.  There was no
money, nor plate, or jewels in the bundle, but a very good suit of
Indian damask, a gown and a petticoat, a laced-head and ruffles of very
good Flanders lace, and some linen and other things, such as I knew
very well the value of.

This was not indeed my own invention, but was given me by one that had
practised it with success, and my governess liked it extremely; and
indeed I tried it again several times, though never twice near the same
place; for the next time I tried it in White Chapel, just by the corner
of Petticoat Lane, where the coaches stand that go out to Stratford and
Bow, and that side of the country, and another time at the Flying
Horse, without Bishopgate, where the Cheston coaches then lay; and I
had always the good luck to come off with some booty.

Another time I placed myself at a warehouse by the waterside, where the
coasting vessels from the north come, such as from Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
Sunderland, and other places.  Here, the warehouses being shut, comes a
young fellow with a letter; and he wanted a box and a hamper that was
come from Newcastle-upon-Tyne.  I asked him if he had the marks of it;
so he shows me the letter, by virtue of which he was to ask for it, and
which gave an account of the contents, the box being full of linen, and
the hamper full of glass ware.  I read the letter, and took care to see
the name, and the marks, the name of the person that sent the goods,
the name of the person that they were sent to; then I bade the
messenger come in the morning, for that the warehouse-keeper would not
be there any more that night.

Away went I, and getting materials in a public house, I wrote a letter
from Mr. John Richardson of Newcastle to his dear cousin Jemmy Cole, in
London, with an account that he sent by such a vessel (for I remembered
all the particulars to a title), so many pieces of huckaback linen, so
many ells of Dutch holland and the like, in a box, and a hamper of
flint glasses from Mr. Henzill's glasshouse; and that the box was
marked I. C. No. 1, and the hamper was directed by a label on the
cording.

About an hour after, I came to the warehouse, found the
warehouse-keeper, and had the goods delivered me without any scruple;
the value of the linen being about #22.

I could fill up this whole discourse with the variety of such
adventures, which daily invention directed to, and which I managed with
the utmost dexterity, and always with success.

At length--as when does the pitcher come safe home that goes so very
often to the well?--I fell into some small broils, which though they
could not affect me fatally, yet made me known, which was the worst
thing next to being found guilty that could befall me.

I had taken up the disguise of a widow's dress; it was without any real
design in view, but only waiting for anything that might offer, as I
often did.  It happened that while I was going along the street in
Covent Garden, there was a great cry of 'Stop thief!  Stop thief!' some
artists had, it seems, put a trick upon a shopkeeper, and being
pursued, some of them fled one way, and some another; and one of them
was, they said, dressed up in widow's weeds, upon which the mob
gathered about me, and some said I was the person, others said no.
Immediately came the mercer's journeyman, and he swore aloud I was the
person, and so seized on me.  However, when I was brought back by the
mob to the mercer's shop, the master of the house said freely that I
was not the woman that was in his shop, and would have let me go
immediately; but another fellow said gravely, 'Pray stay till Mr. ----'
(meaning the journeyman) 'comes back, for he knows her.'  So they kept
me by force near half an hour.  They had called a constable, and he
stood in the shop as my jailer; and in talking with the constable I
inquired where he lived, and what trade he was; the man not
apprehending in the least what happened afterwards, readily told me his
name, and trade, and where he lived; and told me as a jest, that I
might be sure to hear of his name when I came to the Old Bailey.

Some of the servants likewise used me saucily, and had much ado to keep
their hands off me; the master indeed was civiller to me than they, but
he would not yet let me go, though he owned he could not say I was in
his shop before.

I began to be a little surly with him, and told him I hoped he would
not take it ill if I made myself amends upon him in a more legal way
another time; and desired I might send for friends to see me have right
done me.  No, he said, he could give no such liberty; I might ask it
when I came before the justice of peace; and seeing I threatened him,
he would take care of me in the meantime, and would lodge me safe in
Newgate.  I told him it was his time now, but it would be mine by and
by, and governed my passion as well as I was able.  However, I spoke to
the constable to call me a porter, which he did, and then I called for
pen, ink, and paper, but they would let me have none.  I asked the
porter his name, and where he lived, and the poor man told it me very
willingly.  I bade him observe and remember how I was treated there;
that he saw I was detained there by force.  I told him I should want
his evidence in another place, and it should not be the worse for him
to speak.  The porter said he would serve me with all his heart.  'But,
madam,' says he, 'let me hear them refuse to let you go, then I may be
able to speak the plainer.'

With that I spoke aloud to the master of the shop, and said, 'Sir, you
know in your own conscience that I am not the person you look for, and
that I was not in your shop before, therefore I demand that you detain
me here no longer, or tell me the reason of your stopping me.'  The
fellow grew surlier upon this than before, and said he would do neither
till he thought fit.  'Very well,' said I to the constable and to the
porter; 'you will be pleased to remember this, gentlemen, another
time.'  The porter said, 'Yes, madam'; and the constable began not to
like it, and would have persuaded the mercer to dismiss him, and let me
go, since, as he said, he owned I was not the person.  'Good, sir,'
says the mercer to him tauntingly, 'are you a justice of peace or a
constable?  I charged you with her; pray do you do your duty.'  The
constable told him, a little moved, but very handsomely, 'I know my
duty, and what I am, sir; I doubt you hardly know what you are doing.'
They had some other hard words, and in the meantime the journeyman,
impudent and unmanly to the last degree, used me barbarously, and one
of them, the same that first seized upon me, pretended he would search
me, and began to lay hands on me.  I spit in his face, called out to
the constable, and bade him to take notice of my usage.  'And pray, Mr.
Constable,' said I, 'ask that villain's name,' pointing to the man.
The constable reproved him decently, told him that he did not know what
he did, for he knew that his master acknowledged I was not the person
that was in his shop; 'and,' says the constable, 'I am afraid your
master is bringing himself, and me too, into trouble, if this
gentlewoman comes to prove who she is, and where she was, and it
appears that she is not the woman you pretend to.'  'Damn her,' says
the fellow again, with a impudent, hardened face, 'she is the lady, you
may depend upon it; I'll swear she is the same body that was in the
shop, and that I gave the pieces of satin that is lost into her own
hand.  You shall hear more of it when Mr. William and Mr. Anthony
(those  were other journeymen) come back; they will know her again as
well as I.'

Just as the insolent rogue was talking thus to the constable, comes
back Mr. William and Mr. Anthony, as he called them, and a great rabble
with them, bringing along with them the true widow that I was pretended
to be; and they came sweating and bm
home.  In the night, I took my first contrivance, and got up in a tree,
where I slept well; and the next morning proceeded upon my discovery;
travelling nearly four miles, as I might judge by the length of the
valley, keeping still due north, with a ridge of hills on the south and
north side of me.  At the end of this march I came to an opening where
the country seemed to descend to the west; and a little spring of fresh
water, which issued out of the side of the hill by me, ran the other way,
that is, due east; and the country appeared so fresh, so green, so
flourishing, everything being in a constant verdure or flourish of spring
that it looked like a planted garden.  I descended a little on the side
of that delicious vale, surveying it with a secret kind of pleasure,
though mixed with my other afflicting thoughts, to think that this was
all my own; that I was king and lord of all this country indefensibly,
and had a right of possession; and if I could convey it, I might have it
in inheritance as completely as any lord of a manor in England.  I saw
here abundance of cocoa trees, orange, and lemon, and citron trees; but
all wild, and very few bearing any fruit, at least not then.  However,
the green limes that I gathered were not only pleasant to eat, but very
wholesome; and I mixed their juice afterwards with water, which made it
very wholesome, and very cool and refreshing.  I found now I had business
enough to gather and carry home; and I resolved to lay up a store as well
of grapes as limes and lemons, to furnish myself for the wet season,
which I knew was approaching.  In order to do this, I gathered a great
heap of grapes in one place, a lesser heap in another place, and a great
parcel of limes and lemons in another place; and taking a few of each
with me, I travelled homewards; resolving to come again, and bring a bag
or sack, or what I could make, to carry the rest home.  Accordingly,
having spent three days in this journey, I came home (so I must now call
my tent and my cave); but before I got thither the grapes were spoiled;
the richness of the fruit and the weight of the juice having broken them
and bruised them, they were good for little or nothing; as to the limes,
they were good, but I could bring but a few.

The next day, being the nineteenth, I went back, having made me two small
bags to bring home my harvest; but I was surprised, when coming to my
heap of grapes, which were so rich and fine when I gathered them, to find
them all spread about, trod to pieces, and dragged about, some here, some
there, and abundance eaten and devoured.  By this I concluded there were
some wild creatures thereabouts, which had done this; but what they were
I knew not.  However, as I found there was no laying them up on heaps,
and no carrying them away in a sack, but that one way they would be
destroyed, and the other way they would be crushed with their own weight,
I took another course; for I gathered a large quantity of the grapes, and
hung upon the out-branches of the trees, that they might cure and dry in
the sun; and as for the limes and lemons, I carried as many back as I
could well stand under.

When I came home from this journey, I contemplated with great pleasure
the fruitfulness of that valley, and the pleasantness of the situation;
the security from storms on that side of the water, and the wood: and
concluded that I had pitched upon a place to fix my abode which was by
far the worst part of the country.  Upon the whole, I began to consider
of removing my habitation, and looking out for a place equally safe as
where now I was situate, if possible, in that pleasant, fruitful part of
the island.

This thought ran long in my head, and I was exceeding fond of it for some
time, the pleasantness of the place tempting me; but when I came to a
nearer view of it, I considered that I was now by the seaside, where it
was at least possible that something might happen to my advantage, and,
by the same ill fate that brought me hither might bring some other
unhappy wretches to the same place; and though it was scarce probable
that any such thing should ever happen, yet to enclose myself among the
hills and woods in the centre of the island was to anticipate my bondage,
and to render such an affair not only improbable, but impossible; and
that therefore I ought not by any means to remove.  However, I was so
enamoured of this place, that I spent much of my time there for the whole
of the remaining part of the month of July; and though upon second
thoughts, I resolved not to remove, yet I built me a little kind of a
bower, and surrounded it at a distance with a strong fence, being a
double hedge, as high as I could reach, well staked and filled between
with brushwood; and here I lay very secure, sometimes two or three nights
together; always going over it with a ladder; so that I fancied now I had
my country house and my sea-coast house; and this work took me up to the
beginning of August.

I had but newly finished my fence, and began to enjoy my labour, when the
rains came on, and made me stick close to my first habitation; for though
I had made me a tent like the other, with a piece of a sail, and spread
it very well, yet I had not the shelter of a hill to keep me from storms,
nor a cave behind me to retreat into when the rains were extraordinary.

About the beginning of August, as I said, I had finished my bower, and
began to enjoy myself.  The 3rd of August, I found the grapes I had hung
up perfectly dried, and, indeed, were excellent good raisins of the sun;
so I began to take them down from the trees, and it was very happy that I
did so, for the rains which followed would have spoiled them, and I had
lost the best part of my winter food; for I had above two hundred large
bunches of them.  No sooner had I taken them all down, and carried the
most of them home to my cave, than it began to rain; and from hence,
which was the 14th of August, it rained, more or less, every day till the
middle of October; and sometimes so violently, that I could not stir out
of my cave for several days.

In this season I was much surprised with the increase of my family; I had
been concerned for the loss of one of my cats, who ran away from me, or,
as I thought, had been dead, and I heard no more tidings of her till, to
my astonishment, she came home about the end of August with three
kittens.  This was the more strange to me because, though I had killed a
wild cat, as I called it, with my gun, yet I thought it was quite a
different kind from our European cats; but the young cats were the same
kind of house-breed as the old one; and both my cats being females, I
thought it very strange.  But from these three cats I afterwards came to
be so pestered with cats that I was forced to kill them like vermin or
wild beasts, and to drive them from my house as much as possible.

From the 14th of August to the 26th, incessant rain, so that I could not
stir, and was now very careful not to be much wet.  In this confinement,
I began to be straitened for food: but venturing out twice, I one day
killed a goat; and the last day, which was the 26th, found a very large
tortoise, which was a treat to me, and my food was regulated thus: I ate
a bunch of raisins for my breakfast; a piece of the goat’s flesh, or of
the turtle, for my dinner, broiled—for, to my great misfortune, I had no
vessel to boil or stew anything; and two or three of the turtle’s eggs
for my supper.

During this confinement in my cover by the rain, I worked daily two or
three hours at enlarging my cave, and by degrees worked it on towards one
side, till I came to the outside of the hill, and made a door or way out,
which came beyond my fence or wall; and so I came in and out this way.
But I was not perfectly easy at lying so open; for, as I had managed
myself before, I was in a perfect enclosure; whereas now I thought I lay
exposed, and open for anything to come in upon me; and yet I could not
perceive that there was any living thing to fear, the biggest creature
that I had yet seen upon the island being a goat.

_Sept._ 30.—I was now come to the unhappy anniversary of my landing.  I
cast up the notches on my post, and found I had been on shore three
hundred and sixty-five days.  I kept this day as a solemn fast, setting
it apart for religious exercise, prostrating myself on the ground with
the most serious humiliation, confessing my sins to God, acknowledging
His righteous judgments upon me, and praying to Him to have mercy on me
through Jesus Christ; and not having tasted the least refreshment for
twelve hours, even till the going down of the sun, I then ate a
biscuit-cake and a bunch of grapes, and went to bed, finishing the day as
I began it.  I had all this time observed no Sabbath day; for as at first
I had no sense of religion upon my mind, I had, after some time, omitted
to distinguish the weeks, by making a longer notch than ordinary for the
Sabbath day, and so did not really know what any of the days were; but
now, having cast up the days as above, I found I had been there a year;
so I divided it into weeks, and set apart every seventh day for a
Sabbath; though I found at the end of my account I had lost a day or two
in my reckoning.  A little after this, my ink began to fail me, and so I
contented myself to use it more sparingly, and to write down only the
most remarkable events of my life, without continuing a daily memorandum
of other things.

The rainy season and the dry season began now to appear regular to me,
and I learned to divide them so as to provide for them accordingly; but I
bought all my experience before I had it, and this I am going to relate
was one of the most discouraging experiments that I made.

I have mentioned that I had saved the few ears of barley and rice, which
I had so surprisingly found spring up, as I thought, of themselves, and I
believe there were about thirty stalks of rice, and about twenty of
barley; and now I thought it a proper time to sow it, after the rains,
the sun being in its southern position, going from me.  Accordingly, I
dug up a piece of ground as well as I could with my wooden spade, and
dividing it into two parts, I sowed my grain; but as I was sowing, it
casually occurred to my thoughts that I would not sow it all at first,
because I did not know when was the proper time for it, so I sowed about
two-thirds of the seed, leaving about a handful of each.  It was a great
comfort to me afterwards that I did so, for not one grain of what I sowed
this time came to anything: for the dry months following, the earth
having had no rain after the seed was sown, it had no moisture to assist
its growth, and never came up at all till the wet season had come again,
and then it grew as if it had been but newly sown.  Finding my first seed
did not grow, which I easily imagined was by the drought, I sought for a
moister piece of ground to make another trial in, and I dug up a piece of
ground near my new bower, and sowed the rest of my seed in February, a
little before the vernal equinox; and this having the rainy months of
March and April to water it, sprung up very pleasantly, and yielded a
very good crop; but having part of the seed left only, and not daring to
sow all that I had, I had but a small quantity at last, my whole crop not
amounting to above half a peck of each kind.  But by this experiment I
was made master of my business, and knew exactly when the proper season
was to sow, and that I might expect two seed-times and two harvests every
year.

While this corn was growing I made a little discovery, which was of use
to me afterwards.  As soon as the rains were over, and the weather began
to settle, which was about the month of November, I made a visit up the
country to my bower, where, though I had not been some months, yet I
found all things just as I left them.  The circle or double hedge that I
had made was not only firm and entire, but the stakes which I had cut out
of some trees that grew thereabouts were all shot out and grown with long
branches, as much as a willow-tree usually shoots the first year after
lopping its head.  I could not tell what tree to call it that these
stakes were cut from.  I was surprised, and yet very well pleased, to see
the young trees grow; and I pruned them, and led them up to grow as much
alike as I could; and it is scarce credible how beautiful a figure they
grew into in three years; so that though the hedge made a circle of about
twenty-five yards in diameter, yet the trees, for such I might now call
them, soon covered it, and it was a complete shade, sufficient to lodge
under all the dry season.  This made me resolve to cut some more stakes,
and make me a hedge like this, in a semi-circle round my wall (I mean
that of my first dwelling), which I did; and placing the trees or stakes
in a double row, at about eight yards distance from my first fence, they
grew presently, and were at first a fine cover to my habitation, and
afterwards served for a defence also, as I shall observe in its order.

I found now that the seasons of the year might generally be divided, not
into summer and winter, as in Europe, but into the rainy seasons and the
dry seasons, which were generally thus:—The half of February, the whole
of March, and the half of April—rainy, the sun being then on or near the
equinox.

The half of April, the whole of May, June, and July, and the half of
August—dry, the sun being then to the north of the line.

The half of August, the whole of September, and the half of
October—rainy, the sun being then come back.

The half of October, the whole of November, December, and January, and
the half of February—dry, the sun being then to the south of the line.

The rainy seasons sometimes held longer or shorter as the winds happened
to blow, but this was the general observation I made.  After I had found
by experience the ill consequences of being abroad in the rain, I took
care to furnish myself with provisions beforehand, that I might not be
obliged to go out, and I sat within doors as much as possible during the
wet months.  This time I found much employment, and very suitable also to
the time, for I found great occasion for many things which I had no way
to furnish myself with but by hard labour and constant application;
particularly I tried many ways to make myself a basket, but all the twigs
I could get for the purpose proved so brittle that they would do nothing.
It proved of excellent advantage to me now, that when I was a boy, I used
to take great delight in standing at a basket-maker’s, in the town where
my father lived, to see them make their wicker-ware; and being, as boys
usually are, very officious to help, and a great observer of the manner
in which they worked those things, and sometimes lending a hand, I had by
these means full knowledge of the methods of it, and I wanted nothing but
the materials, when it came into my mind that the twigs of that tree from
whence I cut my stakes that grew might possibly be as tough as the
sallows, willows, and osiers in England, and I resolved to try.
Accordingly, the next day I went to my country house, as I called it, and
cutting some of the smaller twigs, I found them to my purpose as much as
I could desire; whereupon I came the next time prepared with a hatchet to
cut down a quantity, which I soon found, for there was great plenty of
them.  These I set up to dry within my circle or hedge, and when they
were fit for use I carried them to my cave; and here, during the next
season, I employed myself in making, as well as I could, a great many
baskets, both to carry earth or to carry or lay up anything, as I had
occasion; and though I did not finish them very handsomely, yet I made
them sufficiently serviceable for my purpose; thus, afterwards, I took
care never to be without them; and as my wicker-ware decayed, I made
more, especially strong, deep baskets to place my corn in, instead of
sacks, when I should come to have any quantity of it.

Having mastered this difficulty, and employed a world of time about it, I
bestirred myself to see, if possible, how to supply two wants.  I had no
vessels to hold anything that was liquid, except two runlets, which were
almost full of rum, and some glass bottles—some of the common size, and
others which were case bottles, square, for the holding of water,
spirits, &c.  I had not so much as a pot to boil anything, except a great
kettle, which I saved out of the ship, and which was too big for such as
I desired it—viz. to make broth, and stew a bit of meat by itself.  The
second thing I fain would have had was a tobacco-pipe, but it was
impossible to me to make one; however, I found a contrivance for that,
too, at last.  I employed myself in planting my second rows of stakes or
piles, and in this wicker-working all the summer or dry season, when
another business took me up more time than it could be imagined I could
spare.




CHAPTER VIII—SURVEYS HIS POSITION


I mentioned before that I had a great mind to see the whole island, and
that I had travelled up the brook, and so on to where I built my bower,
and where I had an opening quite to the sea, on the other side of the
island.  I now resolved to travel quite across to the sea-shore on that
side; so, taking my gun, a hatchet, and my dog, and a larger quantity of
powder and shot than usual, with two biscuit-cakes and a great bunch of
raisins in my pouch for my store, I began my journey.  When I had passed
the vale where my bower stood, as above, I came within view of the sea to
the west, and it being a very clear day, I fairly descried land—whether
an island or a continent I could not tell; but it lay very high,
extending from the W. to the W.S.W. at a very great distance; by my guess
it could not be less than fifteen or twenty leagues off.

I could not tell what part of the world this might be, otherwise than
that I knew it must be part of America, and, as I concluded by all my
observations, must be near the Spanish dominions, and perhaps was all
inhabited by savages, where, if I had landed, I had been in a worse
condition than I was now; and therefore I acquiesced in the dispositions
of Providence, which I began now to own and to believe ordered everything
for the best; I say I quieted my mind with this, and left off afflicting
myself with fruitless wishes of being there.

Besides, after some thought upon this affair, I considered that if this
land was the Spanish coast, I should certainly, one time or other, see
some vessel pass or repass one way or other; but if not, then it was the
savage coast between the Spanish country and Brazils, where are found the
worst of savages; for they are cannibals or men-eaters, and fail not to
murder and devour all the human bodies that fall into their hands.

With these considerations, I walked very leisurely forward.  I found that
side of the island where I now was much pleasanter than mine—the open or
savannah fields sweet, adorned with flowers and grass, and full of very
fine woods.  I saw abundance of parrots, and fain I would have caught
one, if possible, to have kept it to be tame, and taught it to speak to
me.  I did, after some painstaking, catch a young parrot, for I knocked
it down with a stick, and having recovered it, I brought it home; but it
was some years before I could make him speak; however, at last I taught
him to call me by name very familiarly.  But the accident that followed,
though it be a trifle, will be very diverting in its place.

I was exceedingly diverted with this journey.  I found in the low grounds
hares (as I thought them to be) and foxes; but they differed greatly from
all the other kinds I had met with, nor could I satisfy myself to eat
them, though I killed several.  But I had no need to be venturous, for I
had no want of food, and of that which was very good too, especially
these three sorts, viz. goats, pigeons, and turtle, or tortoise, which
added to my grapes, Leadenhall market could not have furnished a table
better than I, in proportion to the company; and though my case was
deplorable enough, yet I had great cause for thankfulness that I was not
driven to any extremities for food, but had rather plenty, even to
dainties.

I never travelled in this journey above two miles outright in a day, or
thereabouts; but I took so many turns and re-turns to see what
discoveries I could make, that I came weary enough to the place where I
resolved to sit down all night; and then I either reposed myself in a
tree, or surrounded myself with a row of stakes set upright in the
ground, either from one tree to another, or so as no wild creature could
come at me without waking me.

As soon as I came to the sea-shore, I was surprised to see that I had
taken up my lot on the worst side of the island, for here, indeed, the
shore was covered with innumerable turtles, whereas on the other side I
had found but three in a year and a half.  Here was also an infinite
number of fowls of many kinds, some which I had seen, and some which I
had not seen before, and many of them very good meat, but such as I knew
not the names of, except those called penguins.

I could have shot as many as I pleased, but was very sparing of my powder
and shot, and therefore had more mind to kill a she-goat if I could,
which I could better feed on; and though there were many goats here, more
than on my side the island, yet it was with much more difficulty that I
could come near them, the country being flat and even, and they saw me
much sooner than when I was on the hills.

I confess this side of the country was much pleasanter than mine; but yet
I had not the least inclination to remove, for as I was fixed in my
habitation it became natural to me, and I seemed all the while I was here
to be as it were upon a journey, and from home.  However, I travelled
along the shore of the sea towards the east, I suppose about twelve
miles, and then setting up a great pole upon the shore for a mark, I
concluded I would go home again, and that the next journey I took should
be on the other side of the island east from my dwelling, and so round
till I came to my post again.

I took another way to come back than that I went, thinking I could easily
keep all the island so much in my view that I could not miss finding my
first dwelling by viewing the country; but I found myself mistaken, for
being come about two or three miles, I found myself descended into a very
large valley, but so surrounded with hills, and those hills covered with
wood, that I could not see which was my way by any direction but that of
the sun, nor even then, unless I knew very well the position of the sun
at that time of the day.  It happened, to my further misfortune, that the
weather proved hazy for three or four days while I was in the valley, and
not being able to see the sun, I wandered about very uncomfortably, and
at last was obliged to find the seaside, look for my post, and come back
the same way I went: and then, by easy journeys, I turned homeward, the
weather being exceeding hot, and my gun, ammunition, hatchet, and other
things very heavy.

In this journey my dog surprised a young kid, and seized upon it; and I,
running in to take hold of it, caught it, and saved it alive from the
dog.  I had a great mind to bring it home if I could, for I had often
been musing whether it might not be possible to get a kid or two, and so
raise a breed of tame goats, which might supply me when my powder and
shot should be all spent.  I made a collar for this little creature, and
with a string, which I made of some rope-yam, which I always carried
about me, I led him along, though with some difficulty, till I came to my
bower, and there I enclosed him and left him, for I was very impatient to
be at home, from whence I had been absent above a month.

I cannot express what a satisfaction it was to me to come into my old
hutch, and lie down in my hammock-bed.  This little wandering journey,
without settled place of abode, had been so unpleasant to me, that my own
house, as I called it to myself, was a perfect settlement to me compared
to that; and it rendered everything about me so comfortable, that I
resolved I would never go a great way from it again while it should be my
lot to stay on the island.

I reposed myself here a week, to rest and regale myself after my long
journey; during which most of the time was taken up in the weighty affair
of making a cage for my Poll, who began now to be a mere domestic, and to
be well acquainted with me.  Then I began to think of the poor kid which
I had penned in within my little circle, and resolved to go and fetch it
home, or give it some food; accordingly I went, and found it where I left
it, for indeed it could not get out, but was almost starved for want of
food.  I went and cut boughs of trees, and branches of such shrubs as I
could find, and threw it over, and having fed it, I tied it as I did
before, to lead it away; but it was so tame with being hungry, that I had
no need to have tied it, for it followed me like a dog: and as I
continually fed it, the creature became so loving, so gentle, and so
fond, that it became from that time one of my domestics also, and would
never leave me afterwards.

The rainy season of the autumnal equinox was now come, and I kept the
30th of September in the same solemn manner as before, being the
anniversary of my landing on the island, having now been there two years,
and no more prospect of being delivered than the first day I came there,
I spent the whole day in humble and thankful acknowledgments of the many
wonderful mercies which my solitary condition was attended with, and
without which it might have been infinitely more miserable.  I gave
humble and hearty thanks that God had been pleased to discover to me that
it was possible I might be more happy in this solitary condition than I
should have been in the liberty of society, and in all the pleasures of
the world; that He could fully make up to me the deficiencies of my
solitary state, and the want of human society, by His presence and the
communications of His grace to my soul; supporting, comforting, and
encouraging me to depend upon His providence here, and hope for His
eternal presence hereafter.

It was now that I began sensibly to feel how much more happy this life I
now led was, with all its miserable circumstances, than the wicked,
cursed, abominable life I led all the past part of my days; and now I
changed both my sorrows and my joys; my very desires altered, my
affections changed their gusts, and my delights were perfectly new from
what they were at my first coming, or, indeed, for the two years past.

Before, as I walked about, either on my hunting or for viewing the
country, the anguish of my soul at my condition would break out upon me
on a sudden, and my very heart would die within me, to think of the
woods, the mountains, the deserts I was in, and how I was a prisoner,
locked up with the eternal bars and bolts of the ocean, in an uninhabited
wilderness, without redemption.  In the midst of the greatest composure
of my mind, this would break out upon me like a storm, and make me wring
my hands and weep like a child.  Sometimes it would take me in the middle
of my work, and I would immediately sit down and sigh, and look upon the
ground for an hour or two together; and this was still worse to me, for
if I could burst out into tears, or vent myself by words, it would go
off, and the grief, having exhausted itself, would abate.

But now I began to exercise myself with new thoughts: I daily read the
word of God, and applied all the comforts of it to my present state.  One
morning, being very sad, I opened the Bible upon these words, “I will
never, never leave thee, nor forsake thee.”  Immediately it occurred that
these words were to me; why else should they be directed in such a
manner, just at the moment when I was mourning over my condition, as one
forsaken of God and man?  “Well, then,” said I, “if God does not forsake
me, of what ill consequence can it be, or what matters it, though the
world should all forsake me, seeing on the other hand, if I had all the
world, and should lose the favour and blessing of God, there would be no
comparison in the loss?”

From this moment I began to conclude in my mind that it was possible for
me to be more happy in this forsaken, solitary condition than it was
probable I should ever have been in any other particular state in the
world; and with this thought I was going to give thanks to God for
bringing me to this place.  I know not what it was, but something shocked
my mind at that thought, and I durst not speak the words.  “How canst
thou become such a hypocrite,” said I, even audibly, “to pretend to be
thankful for a condition which, however thou mayest endeavour to be
contented with, thou wouldst rather pray heartily to be delivered from?”
So I stopped there; but though I could not say I thanked God for being
there, yet I sincerely gave thanks to God for opening my eyes, by
whatever afflicting providences, to see the former condition of my life,
and to mourn for my wickedness, and repent.  I never opened the Bible, or
shut it, but my very soul within me blessed God for directing my friend
in England, without any order of mine, to pack it up among my goods, and
for assisting me afterwards to save it out of the wreck of the ship.

Thus, and in this disposition of mind, I began my third year; and though
I have not given the reader the trouble of so particular an account of my
works this year as the first, yet in general it may be observed that I
was very seldom idle, but having regularly divided my time according to
the several daily employments that were before me, such as: first, my
duty to God, and the reading the Scriptures, which I constantly set apart
some time for thrice every day; secondly, the going abroad with my gun
for food, which generally took me up three hours in every morning, when
it did not rain; thirdly, the ordering, cutting, preserving, and cooking
what I had killed or caught for my supply; these took up great part of
the day.  Also, it is to be considered, that in the middle of the day,
when the sun was in the zenith, the violence of the heat was too great to
stir out; so that about four hours in the evening was all the time I
could be supposed to work in, with this exception, that sometimes I
changed my hours of hunting and working, and went to work in the morning,
and abroad with my gun in the afternoon.

To this short time allowed for labour I desire may be added the exceeding
laboriousness of my work; the many hours which, for want of tools, want
of help, and want of skill, everything I did took up out of my time.  For
example, I was full two and forty days in making a board for a long
shelf, which I wanted in my cave; whereas, two sawyers, with their tools
and a saw-pit, would have cut six of them out of the same tree in half a
day.

My case was this: it was to be a large tree which was to be cut down,
because my board was to be a broad one.  This tree I was three days in
cutting down, and two more cutting off the boughs, and reducing it to a
log or piece of timber.  With inexpressible hacking and hewing I reduced
both the sides of it into chips till it began to be light enough to move;
then I turned it, and made one side of it smooth and flat as a board from
end to end; then, turning that side downward, cut the other side til I
brought the plank to be about three inches thick, and smooth on both
sides.  Any one may judge the labour of my hands in such a piece of work;
but labour and patience carried me through that, and many other things.
I only observe this in particular, to show the reason why so much of my
time went away with so little work—viz. that what might be a little to be
done with help and tools, was a vast labour and required a prodigious
time to do alone, and by hand.  But notwithstanding this, with patience
and labour I got through everything that my circumstances made necessary
to me to do, as will appear by what follows.

I was now, in the months of November and December, expecting my crop of
barley and rice.  The ground I had manured and dug up for them was not
great; for, as I observed, my seed of each was not above the quantity of
half a peck, for I had lost one whole crop by sowing in the dry season.
But now my crop promised very well, when on a sudden I found I was in
danger of losing it all again by enemies of several sorts, which it was
scarcely possible to keep from it; as, first, the goats, and wild
creatures which I called hares, who, tasting the sweetness of the blade,
lay in it night and day, as soon as it came up, and eat it so close, that
it could get no time to shoot up into stalk.

This I saw no remedy for but by making an enclosure about it with a
hedge; which I did with a great deal of toil, and the more, because it
required speed.  However, as my arable land was but small, suited to my
crop, I got it totally well fenced in about three weeks’ time; and
shooting some of the creatures in the daytime, I set my dog to guard it
in the night, tying him up to a stake at the gate, where he would stand
and bark all night long; so in a little time the enemies forsook the
place, and the corn grew very strong and well, and began to ripen apace.

But as the beasts ruined me before, while my corn was in the blade, so
the birds were as likely to ruin me now, when it was in the ear; for,
going along by the place to see how it throve, I saw my little crop
surrounded with fowls, of I know not how many sorts, who stood, as it
were, watching till I should be gone.  I immediately let fly among them,
for I always had my gun with me.  I had no sooner shot, but there rose up
a little cloud of fowls, which I had not seen at all, from among the corn
itself.

This touched me sensibly, for I foresaw that in a few days they would
devour all my hopes; that I should be starved, and never be able to raise
a crop at all; and what to do I could not tell; however, I resolved not
to lose my corn, if possible, though I should watch it night and day.  In
the first place, I went among it to see what damage was already done, and
found they had spoiled a good deal of it; but that as it was yet too
green for them, the loss was not so great but that the remainder was
likely to be a good crop if it could be saved.

I stayed by it to load my gun, and then coming away, I could easily see
the thieves sitting upon all the trees about me, as if they only waited
till I was gone away, and the event proved it to be so; for as I walked
off, as if I was gone, I was no sooner out of their sight than they
dropped down one by one into the corn again.  I was so provoked, that I
could not have patience to stay till more came on, knowing that every
grain that they ate now was, as it might be said, a peck-loaf to me in
the consequence; but coming up to the hedge, I fired again, and killed
three of them.  This was what I wished for; so I took them up, and served
them as we serve notorious thieves in England—hanged them in chains, for
a terror to others.  It is impossible to imagine that this should have
such an effect as it had, for the fowls would not only not come at the
corn, but, in short, they forsook all that part of the island, and I
could never see a bird near the place as long as my scarecrows hung
there.  This I was very glad of, you may be sure, and about the latter
end of December, which was our second harvest of the year, I reaped my
corn.

I was sadly put to it for a scythe or sickle to cut it down, and all I
could do was to make one, as well as I could, out of one of the
broadswords, or cutlasses, which I saved among the arms out of the ship.
However, as my first crop was but small, I had no great difficulty to cut
it down; in short, I reaped it in my way, for I cut nothing off but the
ears, and carried it away in a great basket which I had made, and so
rubbed it out with my hands; and at the end of all my harvesting, I found
that out of my half-peck of seed I had near two bushels of rice, and
about two bushels and a half of barley; that is to say, by my guess, for
I had no measure at that time.

However, this was a great encouragement to me, and I foresaw that, in
time, it would please God to supply me with bread.  And yet here I was
perplexed again, for I neither knew how to grind or make meal of my corn,
or indeed how to clean it and part it; nor, if made into meal, how to
make bread of it; and if how to make it, yet I knew not how to bake it.
These things being added to my desire of having a good quantity for
store, and to secure a constant supply, I resolved not to taste any of
this crop but to preserve it all for seed against the next season; and in
the meantime to employ all my study and hours of working to accomplish
this great work of providing myself with corn and bread.

It might be truly said, that now I worked for my bread.  I believe few
people have thought much upon the strange multitude of little things
necessary in the providing, producing, curing, dressing, making, and
finishing this one article of bread.

I, that was reduced to a mere state of nature, found this to my daily
discouragement; and was made more sensible of it every hour, even after I
had got the first handful of seed-corn, which, as I have said, came up
unexpectedly, and indeed to a surprise.

First, I had no plough to turn up the earth—no spade or shovel to dig it.
Well, this I conquered by making me a wooden spade, as I observed before;
but this did my work but in a wooden manner; and though it cost me a
great many days to make it, yet, for want of iron, it not only wore out
soon, but made my work the harder, and made it be performed much worse.
However, this I bore with, and was content to work it out with patience,
and bear with the badness of the performance.  When the corn was sown, I
had no harrow, but was forced to go over it myself, and drag a great
heavy bough of a tree over it, to scratch it, as it may be called, rather
than rake or harrow it.  When it was growing, and grown, I have observed
already how many things I wanted to fence it, secure it, mow or reap it,
cure and carry it home, thrash, part it from the chaff, and save it.
Then I wanted a mill to grind it sieves to dress it, yeast and salt to
make it into bread, and an oven to bake it; but all these things I did
without, as shall be observed; and yet the corn was an inestimable
comfort and advantage to me too.  All this, as I said, made everything
laborious and tedious to me; but that there was no help for.  Neither was
my time so much loss to me, because, as I had divided it, a certain part
of it was every day appointed to these works; and as I had resolved to
use none of the corn for bread till I had a greater quantity by me, I had
the next six months to apply myself wholly, by labour and invention, to
furnish myself with utensils proper for the performing all the operations
necessary for making the corn, when I had it, fit for my use.




CHAPTER IX—A BOAT


But first I was to prepare more land, for I had now seed enough to sow
above an acre of ground.  Before I did this, I had a week’s work at least
to make me a spade, which, when it was done, was but a sorry one indeed,
and very heavy, and required double labour to work with it.  However, I
got through that, and sowed my seed in two large flat pieces of ground,
as near my house as I could find them to my mind, and fenced them in with
a good hedge, the stakes of which were all cut off that wood which I had
set before, and knew it would grow; so that, in a year’s time, I knew I
should have a quick or living hedge, that would want but little repair.
This work did not take me up less than three months, because a great part
of that time was the wet season, when I could not go abroad.
Within-doors, that is when it rained and I could not go out, I found
employment in the following occupations—always observing, that all the
while I was at work I diverted myself with talking to my parrot, and
teaching him to speak; and I quickly taught him to know his own name, and
at last to speak it out pretty loud, “Poll,” which was the first word I
ever heard spoken in the island by any mouth but my own.  This,
therefore, was not my work, but an assistance to my work; for now, as I
said, I had a great employment upon my hands, as follows: I had long
studied to make, by some means or other, some earthen vessels, which,
indeed, I wanted sorely, but knew not where to come at them.  However,
considering the heat of the climate, I did not doubt but if I could find
out any clay, I might make some pots that might, being dried in the sun,
be hard enough and strong enough to bear handling, and to hold anything
that was dry, and required to be kept so; and as this was necessary in
the preparing corn, meal, &c., which was the thing I was doing, I
resolved to make some as large as I could, and fit only to stand like
jars, to hold what should be put into them.

It would make the reader pity me, or rather laugh at me, to tell how many
awkward ways I took to raise this paste; what odd, misshapen, ugly things
I made; how many of them fell in and how many fell out, the clay not
being stiff enough to bear its own weight; how many cracked by the
over-violent heat of the sun, being set out too hastily; and how many
fell in pieces with only removing, as well before as after they were
dried; and, in a word, how, after having laboured hard to find the
clay—to dig it, to temper it, to bring it home, and work it—I could not
make above two large earthen ugly things (I cannot call them jars) in
about two months’ labour.

However, as the sun baked these two very dry and hard, I lifted them very
gently up, and set them down again in two great wicker baskets, which I
had made on purpose for them, that they might not break; and as between
the pot and the basket there was a little room to spare, I stuffed it
full of the rice and barley straw; and these two pots being to stand
always dry I thought would hold my dry corn, and perhaps the meal, when
the corn was bruised.

Though I miscarried so much in my design for large pots, yet I made
several smaller things with better success; such as little round pots,
flat dishes, pitchers, and pipkins, and any things my hand turned to; and
the heat of the sun baked them quite hard.

But all this would not answer my end, which was to get an earthen pot to
hold what was liquid, and bear the fire, which none of these could do.
It happened after some time, making a pretty large fire for cooking my
meat, when I went to put it out after I had done with it, I found a
broken piece of one of my earthenware vessels in the fire, burnt as hard
as a stone, and red as a tile.  I was agreeably surprised to see it, and
said to myself, that certainly they might be made to burn whole, if they
would burn broken.

This set me to study how to order my fire, so as to make it burn some
pots.  I had no notion of a kiln, such as the potters burn in, or of
glazing them with lead, though I had some lead to do it with; but I
placed three large pipkins and two or three pots in a pile, one upon
another, and placed my firewood all round it, with a great heap of embers
under them.  I plied the fire with fresh fuel round the outside and upon
the top, till I saw the pots in the inside red-hot quite through, and
observed that they did not crack at all.  When I saw them clear red, I
let them stand in that heat about five or six hours, till I found one of
them, though it did not crack, did melt or run; for the sand which was
mixed with the clay melted by the violence of the heat, and would have
run into glass if I had gone on; so I slacked my fire gradually till the
pots began to abate of the red colour; and watching them all night, that
I might not let the fire abate too fast, in the morning I had three very
good (I will not say handsome) pipkins, and two other earthen pots, as
hard burnt as could be desired, and one of them perfectly glazed with the
running of the sand.

After this experiment, I need not say that I wanted no sort of
earthenware for my use; but I must needs say as to the shapes of them,
they were very indifferent, as any one may suppose, when I had no way of
making them but as the children make dirt pies, or as a woman would make
pies that never learned to raise paste.

No joy at a thing of so mean a nature was ever equal to mine, when I
found I had made an earthen pot that would bear the fire; and I had
hardly patience to stay till they were cold before I set one on the fire
again with some water in it to boil me some meat, which it did admirably
well; and with a piece of a kid I made some very good broth, though I
wanted oatmeal, and several other ingredients requisite to make it as
good as I would have had it been.

My next concern was to get me a stone mortar to stamp or beat some corn
in; for as to the mill, there was no thought of arriving at that
perfection of art with one pair of hands.  To supply this want, I was at
a great loss; for, of all the trades in the world, I was as perfectly
unqualified for a stone-cutter as for any whatever; neither had I any
tools to go about it with.  I spent many a day to find out a great stone
big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none
at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which I had no way to dig
or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness
sufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would
bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without
filling it with sand.  So, after a great deal of time lost in searching
for a stone, I gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block
of hard wood, which I found, indeed, much easier; and getting one as big
as I had strength to stir, I rounded it, and formed it on the outside
with my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of fire and infinite
labour, made a hollow place in it, as the Indians in Brazil make their
canoes.  After this, I made a great heavy pestle or beater of the wood
called the iron-wood; and this I prepared and laid by against I had my
next crop of corn, which I proposed to myself to grind, or rather pound
into meal to make bread.

My next difficulty was to make a sieve or searce, to dress my meal, and
to part it from the bran and the husk; without which I did not see it
possible I could have any bread.  This was a most difficult thing even to
think on, for to be sure I had nothing like the necessary thing to make
it—I mean fine thin canvas or stuff to searce the meal through.  And here
I was at a full stop for many months; nor did I really know what to do.
Linen I had none left but what was mere rags; I had goat’s hair, but
neither knew how to weave it or spin it; and had I known how, here were
no tools to work it with.  All the remedy that I found for this was, that
at last I did remember I had, among the seamen’s clothes which were saved
out of the ship, some neckcloths of calico or muslin; and with some
pieces of these I made three small sieves proper enough for the work; and
thus I made shift for some years: how I did afterwards, I shall show in
its place.

The baking part was the next thing to be considered, and how I should
make bread when I came to have corn; for first, I had no yeast.  As to
that part, there was no supplying the want, so I did not concern myself
much about it.  But for an oven I was indeed in great pain.  At length I
found out an experiment for that also, which was this: I made some
earthen-vessels very broad but not deep, that is to say, about two feet
diameter, and not above nine inches deep.  These I burned in the fire, as
I had done the other, and laid them by; and when I wanted to bake, I made
a great fire upon my hearth, which I had paved with some square tiles of
my own baking and burning also; but I should not call them square.

When the firewood was burned pretty much into embers or live coals, I
drew them forward upon this hearth, so as to cover it all over, and there
I let them lie till the hearth was very hot.  Then sweeping away all the
embers, I set down my loaf or loaves, and whelming down the earthen pot
upon them, drew the embers all round the outside of the pot, to keep in
and add to the heat; and thus as well as in the best oven in the world, I
baked my barley-loaves, and became in little time a good pastrycook into
the bargain; for I made myself several cakes and puddings of the rice;
but I made no pies, neither had I anything to put into them supposing I
had, except the flesh either of fowls or goats.

It need not be wondered at if all these things took me up most part of
the third year of my abode here; for it is to be observed that in the
intervals of these things I had my new harvest and husbandry to manage;
for I reaped my corn in its season, and carried it home as well as I
could, and laid it up in the ear, in my large baskets, till I had time to
rub it out, for I had no floor to thrash it on, or instrument to thrash
it with.

And now, indeed, my stock of corn increasing, I really wanted to build my
barns bigger; I wanted a place to lay it up in, for the increase of the
corn now yielded me so much, that I had of the barley about twenty
bushels, and of the rice as much or more; insomuch that now I resolved to
begin to use it freely; for my bread had been quite gone a great while;
also I resolved to see what quantity would be sufficient for me a whole
year, and to sow but once a year.

Upon the whole, I found that the forty bushels of barley and rice were
much more than I could consume in a year; so I resolved to sow just the
same quantity every year that I sowed the last, in hopes that such a
quantity would fully provide me with bread, &c.

All the while these things were doing, you may be sure my thoughts ran
many times upon the prospect of land which I had seen from the other side
of the island; and I was not without secret wishes that I were on shore
there, fancying that, seeing the mainland, and an inhabited country, I
might find some way or other to convey myself further, and perhaps at
last find some means of escape.

But all this while I made no allowance for the dangers of such an
undertaking, and how I might fall into the hands of savages, and perhaps
such as I might have reason to think far worse than the lions and tigers
of Africa: that if I once came in their power, I should run a hazard of
more than a thousand to one of being killed, and perhaps of being eaten;
for I had heard that the people of the Caribbean coast were cannibals or
man-eaters, and I knew by the latitude that I could not be far from that
shore.  Then, supposing they were not cannibals, yet they might kill me,
as many Europeans who had fallen into their hands had been served, even
when they had been ten or twenty together—much more I, that was but one,
and could make little or no defence; all these things, I say, which I
ought to have considered well; and did come into my thoughts afterwards,
yet gave me no apprehensions at first, and my head ran mightily upon the
thought of getting over to the shore.

Now I wished for my boy Xury, and the long-boat with shoulder-of-mutton
sail, with which I sailed above a thousand miles on the coast of Africa;
but this was in vain: then I thought I would go and look at our ship’s
boat, which, as I have said, was blown up upon the shore a great way, in
the storm, when we were first cast away.  She lay almost where she did at
first, but not quite; and was turned, by the force of the waves and the
winds, almost bottom upward, against a high ridge of beachy, rough sand,
but no water about her.  If I had had hands to have refitted her, and to
have launched her into the water, the boat would have done well enough,
and I might have gone back into the Brazils with her easily enough; but I
might have foreseen that I could no more turn her and set her upright
upon her bottom than I could remove the island; however, I went to the
woods, and cut levers and rollers, and brought them to the boat resolving
to try what I could do; suggesting to myself that if I could but turn her
down, I might repair the damage she had received, and she would be a very
good boat, and I might go to sea in her very easily.

I spared no pains, indeed, in this piece of fruitless toil, and spent, I
think, three or four weeks about it; at last finding it impossible to
heave it up with my little strength, I fell to digging away the sand, to
undermine it, and so to make it fall down, setting pieces of wood to
thrust and guide it right in the fall.

But when I had done this, I was unable to stir it up again, or to get
under it, much less to move it forward towards the water; so I was forced
to give it over; and yet, though I gave over the hopes of the boat, my
desire to venture over for the main increased, rather than decreased, as
the means for it seemed impossible.

This at length put me upon thinking whether it was not possible to make
myself a canoe, or periagua, such as the natives of those climates make,
even without tools, or, as I might say, without hands, of the trunk of a
great tree.  This I not only thought possible, but easy, and pleased
myself extremely with the thoughts of making it, and with my having much
more convenience for it than any of the negroes or Indians; but not at
all considering the particular inconveniences which I lay under more than
the Indians did—viz. want of hands to move it, when it was made, into the
water—a difficulty much harder for me to surmount than all the
consequences of want of tools could be to them; for what was it to me, if
when I had chosen a vast tree in the woods, and with much trouble cut it
down, if I had been able with my tools to hew and dub the outside into
the proper shape of a boat, and burn or cut out the inside to make it
hollow, so as to make a boat of it—if, after all this, I must leave it
just there where I found it, and not be able to launch it into the water?

One would have thought I could not have had the least reflection upon my
mind of my circumstances while I was making this boat, but I should have
immediately thought how I should get it into the sea; but my thoughts
were so intent upon my voyage over the sea in it, that I never once
considered how I should get it off the land: and it was really, in its
own nature, more easy for me to guide it over forty-five miles of sea
than about forty-five fathoms of land, where it lay, to set it afloat in
the water.

I went to work upon this boat the most like a fool that ever man did who
had any of his senses awake.  I pleased myself with the design, without
determining whether I was ever able to undertake it; not but that the
difficulty of launching my boat came often into my head; but I put a stop
to my inquiries into it by this foolish answer which I gave myself—“Let
me first make it; I warrant I will find some way or other to get it along
when it is done.”

This was a most preposterous method; but the eagerness of my fancy
prevailed, and to work I went.  I felled a cedar-tree, and I question
much whether Solomon ever had such a one for the building of the Temple
of Jerusalem; it was five feet ten inches diameter at the lower part next
the stump, and four feet eleven inches diameter at the end of twenty-two
feet; after which it lessened for a while, and then parted into branches.
It was not without infinite labour that I felled this tree; I was twenty
days hacking and hewing at it at the bottom; I was fourteen more getting
the branches and limbs and the vast spreading head cut off, which I
hacked and hewed through with axe and hatchet, and inexpressible labour;
after this, it cost me a month to shape it and dub it to a proportion,
and to something like the bottom of a boat, that it might swim upright as
it ought to do.  It cost me near three months more to clear the inside,
and work it out so as to make an exact boat of it; this I did, indeed,
without fire, by mere mallet and chisel, and by the dint of hard labour,
till I had brought it to be a very handsome periagua, and big enough to
have carried six-and-twenty men, and consequently big enough to have
carried me and all my cargo.

When I had gone through this work I was extremely delighted with it.  The
boat was really much bigger than ever I saw a canoe or periagua, that was
made of one tree, in my life.  Many a weary stroke it had cost, you may
be sure; and had I gotten it into the water, I make no question, but I
should have begun the maddest voyage, and the most unlikely to be
performed, that ever was undertaken.

But all my devices to get it into the water failed me; though they cost
me infinite labour too.  It lay about one hundred yards from the water,
and not more; but the first inconvenience was, it was up hill towards the
creek.  Well, to take away this discouragement, I resolved to dig into
the surface of the earth, and so make a declivity: this I began, and it
cost me a prodigious deal of pains (but who grudge pains who have their
deliverance in view?); but when this was worked through, and this
difficulty managed, it was still much the same, for I could no more stir
the canoe than I could the other boat.  Then I measured the distance of
ground, and resolved to cut a dock or canal, to bring the water up to the
canoe, seeing I could not bring the canoe down to the water.  Well, I
began this work; and when I began to enter upon it, and calculate how
deep it was to be dug, how broad, how the stuff was to be thrown out, I
found that, by the number of hands I had, being none but my own, it must
have been ten or twelve years before I could have gone through with it;
for the shore lay so high, that at the upper end it must have been at
least twenty feet deep; so at length, though with great reluctancy, I
gave this attempt over also.

This grieved me heartily; and now I saw, though too late, the folly of
beginning a work before we count the cost, and before we judge rightly of
our own strength to go through with it.

In the middle of this work I finished my fourth year in this place, and
kept my anniversary with the same devotion, and with as much comfort as
ever before; for, by a constant study and serious application to the Word
of God, and by the assistance of His grace, I gained a different
knowledge from what I had before.  I entertained different notions of
things.  I looked now upon the world as a thing remote, which I had
nothing to do with, no expectations from, and, indeed, no desires about:
in a word, I had nothing indeed to do with it, nor was ever likely to
have, so I thought it looked, as we may perhaps look upon it
hereafter—viz. as a place I had lived in, but was come out of it; and
well might I say, as Father Abraham to Dives, “Between me and thee is a
great gulf fixed.”

In the first place, I was removed from all the wickedness of the world
here; I had neither the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, nor the
pride of life.  I had nothing to covet, for I had all that I was now
capable of enjoying; I was lord of the whole manor; or, if I pleased, I
might call myself king or emperor over the whole country which I had
possession of: there were no rivals; I had no competitor, none to dispute
sovereignty or command with me: I might have raised ship-loadings of
corn, but I had no use for it; so I let as little grow as I thought
enough for my occasion.  I had tortoise or turtle enough, but now and
then one was as much as I could put to any use: I had timber enough to
have built a fleet of ships; and I had grapes enough to have made wine,
or to have cured into raisins, to have loaded that fleet when it had been
built.

But all I could make use of was all that was valuable: I had enough to
eat and supply my wants, and what was all the rest to me?  If I killed
more flesh than I could eat, the dog must eat it, or vermin; if I sowed
more corn than I could eat, it must be spoiled; the trees that I cut down
were lying to rot on the ground; I could make no more use of them but for
fuel, and that I had no occasion for but to dress my food.

In a word, the nature and experience of things dictated to me, upon just
reflection, that all the good things of this world are no farther good to
us than they are for our use; and that, whatever we may heap up to give
others, we enjoy just as much as we can use, and no more.  The most
covetous, griping miser in the world would have been cured of the vice of
covetousness if he had been in my case; for I possessed infinitely more
than I knew what to do with.  I had no room for desire, except it was of
things which I had not, and they were but trifles, though, indeed, of
great use to me.  I had, as I hinted before, a parcel of money, as well
gold as silver, about thirty-six pounds sterling.  Alas! there the sorry,
useless stuff lay; I had no more manner of business for it; and often
thought with myself that I would have given a handful of it for a gross
of tobacco-pipes; or for a hand-mill to grind my corn; nay, I would have
given it all for a sixpenny-worth of turnip and carrot seed out of
England, or for a handful of peas and beans, and a bottle of ink.  As it
was, I had not the least advantage by it or benefit from it; but there it
lay in a drawer, and grew mouldy with the damp of the cave in the wet
seasons; and if I had had the drawer full of diamonds, it had been the
same case—they had been of no manner of value to me, because of no use.

I had now brought my state of life to be much easier in itself than it
was at first, and much easier to my mind, as well as to my body.  I
frequently sat down to meat with thankfulness, and admired the hand of
God’s providence, which had thus spread my table in the wilderness.  I
learned to look more upon the bright side of my condition, and less upon
the dark side, and to consider what I enjoyed rather than what I wanted;
and this gave me sometimes such secret comforts, that I cannot express
them; and which I take notice of here, to put those discontented people
in mind of it, who cannot enjoy comfortably what God has given them,
because they see and covet something that He has not given them.  All our
discontents about what we want appeared to me to spring from the want of
thankfulness for what we have.

Another reflection was of great use to me, and doubtless would be so to
any one that should fall into such distress as mine was; and this was, to
compare my present condition with what I at first expected it would be;
nay, with what it would certainly have been, if the good providence of
God had not wonderfully ordered the ship to be cast up nearer to the
shore, where I not only could come at her, but could bring what I got out
of her to the shore, for my relief and comfort; without which, I had
wanted for tools to work, weapons for defence, and gunpowder and shot for
getting my food.

I spent whole hours, I may say whole days, in representing to myself, in
the most lively colours, how I must have acted if I had got nothing out
of the ship.  How I could not have so much as got any food, except fish
and turtles; and that, as it was long before I found any of them, I must
have perished first; that I should have lived, if I had not perished,
like a mere savage; that if I had killed a goat or a fowl, by any
contrivance, I had no way to flay or open it, or part the flesh from the
skin and the bowels, or to cut it up; but must gnaw it with my teeth, and
pull it with my claws, like a beast.

These reflections made me very sensible of the goodness of Providence to
me, and very thankful for my present condition, with all its hardships
and misfortunes; and this part also I cannot but recommend to the
reflection of those who are apt, in their misery, to say, “Is any
affliction like mine?”  Let them consider how much worse the cases of
some people are, and their case might have been, if Providence had
thought fit.

I had another reflection, which assisted me also to comfort my mind with
hopes; and this was comparing my present situation with what I had
deserved, and had therefore reason to expect from the hand of Providence.
I had lived a dreadful life, perfectly destitute of the knowledge and
fear of God.  I had been well instructed by father and mother; neither
had they been wanting to me in their early endeavours to infuse a
religious awe of God into my mind, a sense of my duty, and what the
nature and end of my being required of me.  But, alas! falling early into
the seafaring life, which of all lives is the most destitute of the fear
of God, though His terrors are always before them; I say, falling early
into the seafaring life, and into seafaring company, all that little
sense of religion which I had entertained was laughed out of me by my
messmates; by a hardened despising of dangers, and the views of death,
which grew habitual to me by my long absence from all manner of
opportunities to converse with anything but what was like myself, or to
hear anything that was good or tended towards it.

So void was I of everything that was good, or the least sense of what I
was, or was to be, that, in the greatest deliverances I enjoyed—such as
my escape from Sallee; my being taken up by the Portuguese master of the
ship; my being planted so well in the Brazils; my receiving the cargo
from England, and the like—I never had once the words “Thank God!” so
much as on my mind, or in my mouth; nor in the greatest distress had I so
much as a thought to pray to Him, or so much as to say, “Lord, have mercy
upon me!” no, nor to mention the name of God, unless it was to swear by,
and blaspheme it.

I had terrible reflections upon my mind for many months, as I have
already observed, on account of my wicked and hardened life past; and
when I looked about me, and considered what particular providences had
attended me since my coming into this place, and how God had dealt
bountifully with me—had not only punished me less than my iniquity had
deserved, but had so plentifully provided for me—this gave me great hopes
that my repentance was accepted, and that God had yet mercy in store for
me.

With these reflections I worked my mind up, not only to a resignation to
the will of God in the present disposition of my circumstances, but even
to a sincere thankfulness for my condition; and that I, who was yet a
living man, ought not to complain, seeing I had not the due punishment of
my sins; that I enjoyed so many mercies which I had no reason to have
expected in that place; that I ought never more to repine at my
condition, but to rejoice, and to give daily thanks for that daily bread,
which nothing but a crowd of wonders could have brought; that I ought to
consider I had been fed even by a miracle, even as great as that of
feeding Elijah by ravens, nay, by a long series of miracles; and that I
could hardly have named a place in the uninhabitable part of the world
where I could have been cast more to my advantage; a place where, as I
had no society, which was my affliction on one hand, so I found no
ravenous beasts, no furious wolves or tigers, to threaten my life; no
venomous creatures, or poisons, which I might feed on to my hurt; no
savages to murder and devour me.  In a word, as my life was a life of
sorrow one way, so it was a life of mercy another; and I wanted nothing
to make it a life of comfort but to be able to make my sense of God’s
goodness to me, and care over me in this condition, be my daily
consolation; and after I did make a just improvement on these things, I
went away, and was no more sad.  I had now been here so long that many
things which I had brought on shore for my help were either quite gone,
or very much wasted and near spent.

My ink, as I observed, had been gone some time, all but a very little,
which I eked out with water, a little and a little, till it was so pale,
it scarce left any appearance of black upon the paper.  As long as it
lasted I made use of it to minute down the days of the month on which any
remarkable thing happened to me; and first, by casting up times past, I
remembered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various
providences which befell me, and which, if I had been superstitiously
inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, I might have had reason
to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity.

First, I had observed that the same day that I broke away from my father
and friends and ran away to Hull, in order to go to sea, the same day
afterwards I was taken by the Sallee man-of-war, and made a slave; the
same day of the year that I escaped out of the wreck of that ship in
Yarmouth Roads, that same day-year afterwards I made my escape from
Sallee in a boat; the same day of the year I was born on—viz. the 30th of
September, that same day I had my life so miraculously saved twenty-six
years after, when I was cast on shore in this island; so that my wicked
life and my solitary life began both on a day.

The next thing to my ink being wasted was that of my bread—I mean the
biscuit which I brought out of the ship; this I had husbanded to the last
degree, allowing myself but one cake of bread a-day for above a year; and
yet I was quite without bread for near a year before I got any corn of my
own, and great reason I had to be thankful that I had any at all, the
getting it being, as has been already observed, next to miraculous.

My clothes, too, began to decay; as to linen, I had had none a good
while, except some chequered shirts which I found in the chests of the
other seamen, and which I carefully preserved; because many times I could
bear no other clothes on but a shirt; and it was a very great help to me
that I had, among all the men’s clothes of the ship, almost three dozen
of shirts.  There were also, indeed, several thick watch-coats of the
seamen’s which were left, but they were too hot to wear; and though it is
true that the weather was so violently hot that there was no need of
clothes, yet I could not go quite naked—no, though I had been inclined to
it, which I was not—nor could I abide the thought of it, though I was
alone.  The reason why I could not go naked was, I could not bear the
heat of the sun so well when quite naked as with some clothes on; nay,
the very heat frequently blistered my skin: whereas, with a shirt on, the
air itself made some motion, and whistling under the shirt, was twofold
cooler than without it.  No more could I ever bring myself to go out in
the heat of the sun without a cap or a hat; the heat of the sun, beating
with such violence as it does in that place, would give me the headache
presently, by darting so directly on my head, without a cap or hat on, so
that I could not bear it; whereas, if I put on my hat it would presently
go away.

Upon these views I began to consider about putting the few rags I had,
which I called clothes, into some order; I had worn out all the
waistcoats I had, and my business was now to try if I could not make
jackets out of the great watch-coats which I had by me, and with such
other materials as I had; so I set to work, tailoring, or rather, indeed,
botching, for I made most piteous work of it.  However, I made shift to
make two or three new waistcoats, which I hoped would serve me a great
while: as for breeches or drawers, I made but a very sorry shift indeed
till afterwards.

I have mentioned that I saved the skins of all the creatures that I
killed, I mean four-footed ones, and I had them hung up, stretched out
with sticks in the sun, by which means some of them were so dry and hard
that they were fit for little, but others were very useful.  The first
thing I made of these was a great cap for my head, with the hair on the
outside, to shoot off the rain; and this I performed so well, that after
I made me a suit of clothes wholly of these skins—that is to say, a
waistcoat, and breeches open at the knees, and both loose, for they were
rather wanting to keep me cool than to keep me warm.  I must not omit to
acknowledge that they were wretchedly made; for if I was a bad carpenter,
I was a worse tailor.  However, they were such as I made very good shift
with, and when I was out, if it happened to rain, the hair of my
waistcoat and cap being outermost, I was kept very dry.

After this, I spent a great deal of time and pains to make an umbrella; I
was, indeed, in great want of one, and had a great mind to make one; I
had seen them made in the Brazils, where they are very useful in the
great heats there, and I felt the heats every jot as great here, and
greater too, being nearer the equinox; besides, as I was obliged to be
much abroad, it was a most useful thing to me, as well for the rains as
the heats.  I took a world of pains with it, and was a great while before
I could make anything likely to hold: nay, after I had thought I had hit
the way, I spoiled two or three before I made one to my mind: but at last
I made one that answered indifferently well: the main difficulty I found
was to make it let down.  I could make it spread, but if it did not let
down too, and draw in, it was not portable for me any way but just over
my head, which would not do.  However, at last, as I said, I made one to
answer, and covered it with skins, the hair upwards, so that it cast off
the rain like a pent-house, and kept off the sun so effectually, that I
could walk out in the hottest of the weather with greater advantage than
I could before in the coolest, and when I had no need of it could close
it, and carry it under my arm.

Thus I lived mighty comfortably, my mind being entirely composed by
resigning myself to the will of God, and throwing myself wholly upon the
disposal of His providence.  This made my life better than sociable, for
when I began to regret the want of conversation I would ask myself,
whether thus conversing mutually with my own thoughts, and (as I hope I
may say) with even God Himself, by ejaculations, was not better than the
utmost enjoyment of human society in the world?




CHAPTER X—TAMES GOATS


I cannot say that after this, for five years, any extraordinary thing
happened to me, but I lived on in the same course, in the same posture
and place, as before; the chief things I was employed in, besides my
yearly labour of planting my barley and rice, and curing my raisins, of
both which I always kept up just enough to have sufficient stock of one
year’s provisions beforehand; I say, besides this yearly labour, and my
daily pursuit of going out with my gun, I had one labour, to make a
canoe, which at last I finished: so that, by digging a canal to it of six
feet wide and four feet deep, I brought it into the creek, almost half a
mile.  As for the first, which was so vastly big, for I made it without
considering beforehand, as I ought to have done, how I should be able to
launch it, so, never being able to bring it into the water, or bring the
water to it, I was obliged to let it lie where it was as a memorandum to
teach me to be wiser the next time: indeed, the next time, though I could
not get a tree proper for it, and was in a place where I could not get
the water to it at any less distance than, as I have said, near half a
mile, yet, as I saw it was practicable at last, I never gave it over; and
though I was near two years about it, yet I never grudged my labour, in
hopes of having a boat to go off to sea at last.

However, though my little periagua was finished, yet the size of it was
not at all answerable to the design which I had in view when I made the
first; I mean of venturing over to the _terra firma_, where it was above
forty miles broad; accordingly, the smallness of my boat assisted to put
an end to that design, and now I thought no more of it.  As I had a boat,
my next design was to make a cruise round the island; for as I had been
on the other side in one place, crossing, as I have already described it,
over the land, so the discoveries I made in that little journey made me
very eager to see other parts of the coast; and now I had a boat, I
thought of nothing but sailing round the island.

For this purpose, that I might do everything with discretion and
consideration, I fitted up a little mast in my boat, and made a sail too
out of some of the pieces of the ship’s sails which lay in store, and of
which I had a great stock by me.  Having fitted my mast and sail, and
tried the boat, I found she would sail very well; then I made little
lockers or boxes at each end of my boat, to put provisions, necessaries,
ammunition, &c., into, to be kept dry, either from rain or the spray of
the sea; and a little, long, hollow place I cut in the inside of the
boat, where I could lay my gun, making a flap to hang down over it to
keep it dry.

I fixed my umbrella also in the step at the stern, like a mast, to stand
over my head, and keep the heat of the sun off me, like an awning; and
thus I every now and then took a little voyage upon the sea, but never
went far out, nor far from the little creek.  At last, being eager to
view the circumference of my little kingdom, I resolved upon my cruise;
and accordingly I victualled my ship for the voyage, putting in two dozen
of loaves (cakes I should call them) of barley-bread, an earthen pot full
of parched rice (a food I ate a good deal of), a little bottle of rum,
half a goat, and powder and shot for killing more, and two large
watch-coats, of those which, as I mentioned before, I had saved out of
the seamen’s chests; these I took, one to lie upon, and the other to
cover me in the night.

It was the 6th of November, in the sixth year of my reign—or my
captivity, which you please—that I set out on this voyage, and I found it
much longer than I expected; for though the island itself was not very
large, yet when I came to the east side of it, I found a great ledge of
rocks lie out about two leagues into the sea, some above water, some
under it; and beyond that a shoal of sand, lying dry half a league more,
so that I was obliged to go a great way out to sea to double the point.

When I first discovered them, I was going to give over my enterprise, and
come back again, not knowing how far it might oblige me to go out to sea;
and above all, doubting how I should get back again: so I came to an
anchor; for I had made a kind of an anchor with a piece of a broken
grappling which I got out of the ship.

Having secured my boat, I took my gun and went on shore, climbing up a
hill, which seemed to overlook that point where I saw the full extent of
it, and resolved to venture.

In my viewing the sea from that hill where I stood, I perceived a strong,
and indeed a most furious current, which ran to the east, and even came
close to the point; and I took the more notice of it because I saw there
might be some danger that when I came into it I might be carried out to
sea by the strength of it, and not be able to make the island again; and
indeed, had I not got first upon this hill, I believe it would have been
so; for there was the same current on the other side the island, only
that it set off at a further distance, and I saw there was a strong eddy
under the shore; so I had nothing to do but to get out of the first
current, and I should presently be in an eddy.

I lay here, however, two days, because the wind blowing pretty fresh at
ESE., and that being just contrary to the current, made a great breach of
the sea upon the point: so that it was not safe for me to keep too close
to the shore for the breach, nor to go too far off, because of the
stream.

The third day, in the morning, the wind having abated overnight, the sea
was calm, and I ventured: but I am a warning to all rash and ignorant
pilots; for no sooner was I come to the point, when I was not even my
boat’s length from the shore, but I found myself in a great depth of
water, and a current like the sluice of a mill; it carried my boat along
with it with such violence that all I could do could not keep her so much
as on the edge of it; but I found it hurried me farther and farther out
from the eddy, which was on my left hand.  There was no wind stirring to
help me, and all I could do with my paddles signified nothing: and now I
began to give myself over for lost; for as the current was on both sides
of the island, I knew in a few leagues distance they must join again, and
then I was irrecoverably gone; nor did I see any possibility of avoiding
it; so that I had no prospect before me but of perishing, not by the sea,
for that was calm enough, but of starving from hunger.  I had, indeed,
found a tortoise on the shore, as big almost as I could lift, and had
tossed it into the boat; and I had a great jar of fresh water, that is to
say, one of my earthen pots; but what was all this to being driven into
the vast ocean, where, to be sure, there was no shore, no mainland or
island, for a thousand leagues at least?

And now I saw how easy it was for the providence of God to make even the
most miserable condition of mankind worse.  Now I looked back upon my
desolate, solitary island as the most pleasant place in the world and all
the happiness my heart could wish for was to be but there again.  I
stretched out my hands to it, with eager wishes—“O happy desert!” said I,
“I shall never see thee more.  O miserable creature! whither am going?”
Then I reproached myself with my unthankful temper, and that I had
repined at my solitary condition; and now what would I give to be on
shore there again!  Thus, we never see the true state of our condition
till it is illustrated to us by its contraries, nor know how to value
what we enjoy, but by the want of it.  It is scarcely possible to imagine
the consternation I was now in, being driven from my beloved island (for
so it appeared to me now to be) into the wide ocean, almost two leagues,
and in the utmost despair of ever recovering it again.  However, I worked
hard till, indeed, my strength was almost exhausted, and kept my boat as
much to the northward, that is, towards the side of the current which the
eddy lay on, as possibly I could; when about noon, as the sun passed the
meridian, I thought I felt a little breeze of wind in my face, springing
up from SSE.  This cheered my heart a little, and especially when, in
about half-an-hour more, it blew a pretty gentle gale.  By this time I
had got at a frightful distance from the island, and had the least cloudy
or hazy weather intervened, I had been undone another way, too; for I had
no compass on board, and should never have known how to have steered
towards the island, if I had but once lost sight of it; but the weather
continuing clear, I applied myself to get up my mast again, and spread my
sail, standing away to the north as much as possible, to get out of the
current.

Just as I had set my mast and sail, and the boat began to stretch away, I
saw even by the clearness of the water some alteration of the current was
near; for where the current was so strong the water was foul; but
perceiving the water clear, I found the current abate; and presently I
found to the east, at about half a mile, a breach of the sea upon some
rocks: these rocks I found caused the current to part again, and as the
main stress of it ran away more southerly, leaving the rocks to the
north-east, so the other returned by the repulse of the rocks, and made a
strong eddy, which ran back again to the north-west, with a very sharp
stream.

They who know what it is to have a reprieve brought to them upon the
ladder, or to be rescued from thieves just going to murder them, or who
have been in such extremities, may guess what my present surprise of joy
was, and how gladly I put my boat into the stream of this eddy; and the
wind also freshening, how gladly I spread my sail to it, running
cheerfully before the wind, and with a strong tide or eddy underfoot.

This eddy carried me about a league on my way back again, directly
towards the island, but about two leagues more to the northward than the
current which carried me away at first; so that when I came near the
island, I found myself open to the northern shore of it, that is to say,
the other end of the island, opposite to that which I went out from.

When I had made something more than a league of way by the help of this
current or eddy, I found it was spent, and served me no further.
However, I found that being between two great currents—viz. that on the
south side, which had hurried me away, and that on the north, which lay
about a league on the other side; I say, between these two, in the wake
of the island, I found the water at least still, and running no way; and
having still a breeze of wind fair for me, I kept on steering directly
for the island, though not making such fresh way as I did before.

About four o’clock in the evening, being then within a league of the
island, I found the point of the rocks which occasioned this disaster
stretching out, as is described before, to the southward, and casting off
the current more southerly, had, of course, made another eddy to the
north; and this I found very strong, but not directly setting the way my
course lay, which was due west, but almost full north.  However, having a
fresh gale, I stretched across this eddy, slanting north-west; and in
about an hour came within about a mile of the shore, where, it being
smooth water, I soon got to land.

When I was on shore, God I fell on my knees and gave God thanks for my
deliverance, resolving to lay aside all thoughts of my deliverance by my
boat; and refreshing myself with such things as I had, I brought my boat
close to the shore, in a little cove that I had spied under some trees,
and laid me down to sleep, being quite spent with the labour and fatigue
of the voyage.

I was now at a great loss which way to get home with my boat!  I had run
so much hazard, and knew too much of the case, to think of attempting it
by the way I went out; and what might be at the other side (I mean the
west side) I knew not, nor had I any mind to run any more ventures; so I
resolved on the next morning to make my way westward along the shore, and
to see if there was no creek where I might lay up my frigate in safety,
so as to have her again if I wanted her.  In about three miles or
thereabouts, coasting the shore, I came to a very good inlet or bay,
about a mile over, which narrowed till it came to a very little rivulet
or brook, where I found a very convenient harbour for my boat, and where
she lay as if she had been in a little dock made on purpose for her.
Here I put in, and having stowed my boat very safe, I went on shore to
look about me, and see where I was.

I soon found I had but a little passed by the place where I had been
before, when I travelled on foot to that shore; so taking nothing out of
my boat but my gun and umbrella, for it was exceedingly hot, I began my
march.  The way was comfortable enough after such a voyage as I had been
upon, and I reached my old bower in the evening, where I found everything
standing as I left it; for I always kept it in good order, being, as I
said before, my country house.

I got over the fence, and laid me down in the shade to rest my limbs, for
I was very weary, and fell asleep; but judge you, if you can, that read
my story, what a surprise I must be in when I was awaked out of my sleep
by a voice calling me by my name several times, “Robin, Robin, Robin
Crusoe: poor Robin Crusoe!  Where are you, Robin Crusoe?  Where are you?
Where have you been?”

I was so dead asleep at first, being fatigued with rowing, or part of the
day, and with walking the latter part, that I did not wake thoroughly;
but dozing thought I dreamed that somebody spoke to me; but as the voice
continued to repeat, “Robin Crusoe, Robin Crusoe,” at last I began to
wake more perfectly, and was at first dreadfully frightened, and started
up in the utmost consternation; but no sooner were my eyes open, but I
saw my Poll sitting on the top of the hedge; and immediately knew that it
was he that spoke to me; for just in such bemoaning language I had used
to talk to him and teach him; and he had learned it so perfectly that he
would sit upon my finger, and lay his bill close to my face and cry,
“Poor Robin Crusoe!  Where are you?  Where have you been?  How came you
here?” and such things as I had taught him.

However, even though I knew it was the parrot, and that indeed it could
be nobody else, it was a good while before I could compose myself.
First, I was amazed how the creature got thither; and then, how he should
just keep about the place, and nowhere else; but as I was well satisfied
it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got over it; and holding out my
hand, and calling him by his name, “Poll,” the sociable creature came to
me, and sat upon my thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me,
“Poor Robin Crusoe! and how did I come here? and where had I been?” just
as if he had been overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him home
along with me.

I had now had enough of rambling to sea for some time, and had enough to
do for many days to sit still and reflect upon the danger I had been in.
I would have been very glad to have had my boat again on my side of the
island; but I knew not how it was practicable to get it about.  As to the
east side of the island, which I had gone round, I knew well enough there
was no venturing that way; my very heart would shrink, and my very blood
run chill, but to think of it; and as to the other side of the island, I
did not know how it might be there; but supposing the current ran with
the same force against the shore at the east as it passed by it on the
other, I might run the same risk of being driven down the stream, and
carried by the island, as I had been before of being carried away from
it: so with these thoughts, I contented myself to be without any boat,
though it had been the product of so many months’ labour to make it, and
of so many more to get it into the sea.

In this government of my temper I remained near a year; and lived a very
sedate, retired life, as you may well suppose; and my thoughts being very
much composed as to my condition, and fully comforted in resigning myself
to the dispositions of Providence, I thought I lived really very happily
in all things except that of society.

I improved myself in this time in all the mechanic exercises which my
necessities put me upon applying myself to; and I believe I should, upon
occasion, have made a very good carpenter, especially considering how few
tools I had.

Besides this, I arrived at an unexpected perfection in my earthenware,
and contrived well enough to make them with a wheel, which I found
infinitely easier and better; because I made things round and shaped,
which before were filthy things indeed to look on.  But I think I was
never more vain of my own performance, or more joyful for anything I
found out, than for my being able to make a tobacco-pipe; and though it
was a very ugly, clumsy thing when it was done, and only burned red, like
other earthenware, yet as it was hard and firm, and would draw the smoke,
I was exceedingly comforted with it, for I had been always used to smoke;
and there were pipes in the ship, but I forgot them at first, not
thinking there was tobacco in the island; and afterwards, when I searched
the ship again, I could not come at any pipes.

In my wicker-ware also I improved much, and made abundance of necessary
baskets, as well as my invention showed me; though not very handsome, yet
they were such as were very handy and convenient for laying things up in,
or fetching things home.  For example, if I killed a goat abroad, I could
hang it up in a tree, flay it, dress it, and cut it in pieces, and bring
it home in a basket; and the like by a turtle; I could cut it up, take
out the eggs and a piece or two of the flesh, which was enough for me,
and bring them home in a basket, and leave the rest behind me.  Also,
large deep baskets were the receivers of my corn, which I always rubbed
out as soon as it was dry and cured, and kept it in great baskets.

I began now to perceive my powder abated considerably; this was a want
which it was impossible for me to supply, and I began seriously to
consider what I must do when I should have no more powder; that is to
say, how I should kill any goats.  I had, as is observed in the third
year of my being here, kept a young kid, and bred her up tame, and I was
in hopes of getting a he-goat; but I could not by any means bring it to
pass, till my kid grew an old goat; and as I could never find in my heart
to kill her, she died at last of mere age.

But being now in the eleventh year of my residence, and, as I have said,
my ammunition growing low, I set myself to study some art to trap and
snare the goats, to see whether I could not catch some of them alive; and
particularly I wanted a she-goat great with young.  For this purpose I
made snares to hamper them; and I do believe they were more than once
taken in them; but my tackle was not good, for I had no wire, and I
always found them broken and my bait devoured.  At length I resolved to
try a pitfall; so I dug several large pits in the earth, in places where
I had observed the goats used to feed, and over those pits I placed
hurdles of my own making too, with a great weight upon them; and several
times I put ears of barley and dry rice without setting the trap; and I
could easily perceive that the goats had gone in and eaten up the corn,
for I could see the marks of their feet.  At length I set three traps in
one night, and going the next morning I found them, all standing, and yet
the bait eaten and gone; this was very discouraging.  However, I altered
my traps; and not to trouble you with particulars, going one morning to
see my traps, I found in one of them a large old he-goat; and in one of
the others three kids, a male and two females.

As to the old one, I knew not what to do with him; he was so fierce I
durst not go into the pit to him; that is to say, to bring him away
alive, which was what I wanted.  I could have killed him, but that was
not my business, nor would it answer my end; so I even let him out, and
he ran away as if he had been frightened out of his wits.  But I did not
then know what I afterwards learned, that hunger will tame a lion.  If I
had let him stay three or four days without food, and then have carried
him some water to drink and then a little corn, he would have been as
tame as one of the kids; for they are mighty sagacious, tractable
creatures, where they are well used.

However, for the present I let him go, knowing no better at that time:
then I went to the three kids, and taking them one by one, I tied them
with strings together, and with some difficulty brought them all home.

It was a good while before they would feed; but throwing them some sweet
corn, it tempted them, and they began to be tame.  And now I found that
if I expected to supply myself with goats’ flesh, when I had no powder or
shot left, breeding some up tame was my only way, when, perhaps, I might
have them about my house like a flock of sheep.  But then it occurred to
me that I must keep the tame from the wild, or else they would always run
wild when they grew up; and the only way for this was to have some
enclosed piece of ground, well fenced either with hedge or pale, to keep
them in so effectually, that those within might not break out, or those
without break in.

This was a great undertaking for one pair of hands yet, as I saw there
was an absolute necessity for doing it, my first work was to find out a
proper piece of ground, where there was likely to be herbage for them to
eat, water for them to drink, and cover to keep them from the sun.

Those who understand such enclosures will think I had very little
contrivance when I pitched upon a place very proper for all these (being
a plain, open piece of meadow land, or savannah, as our people call it in
the western colonies), which had two or three little drills of fresh
water in it, and at one end was very woody—I say, they will smile at my
forecast, when I shall tell them I began by enclosing this piece of
ground in such a manner that, my hedge or pale must have been at least
two miles about.  Nor was the madness of it so great as to the compass,
for if it was ten miles about, I was like to have time enough to do it
in; but I did not consider that my goats would be as wild in so much
compass as if they had had the whole island, and I should have so much
room to chase them in that I should never catch them.

My hedge was begun and carried on, I believe, about fifty yards when this
thought occurred to me; so I presently stopped short, and, for the
beginning, I resolved to enclose a piece of about one hundred and fifty
yards in length, and one hundred yards in breadth, which, as it would
maintain as many as I should have in any reasonable time, so, as my stock
increased, I could add more ground to my enclosure.

This was acting with some prudence, and I went to work with courage.  I
was about three months hedging in the first piece; and, till I had done
it, I tethered the three kids in the best part of it, and used them to
feed as near me as possible, to make them familiar; and very often I
would go and carry them some ears of barley, or a handful of rice, and
feed them out of my hand; so that after my enclosure was finished and I
let them loose, they would follow me up and down, bleating after me for a
handful of corn.

This answered my end, and in about a year and a half I had a flock of
about twelve goats, kids and all; and in two years more I had
three-and-forty, besides several that I took and killed for my food.
After that, I enclosed five several pieces of ground to feed them in,
with little pens to drive them to take them as I wanted, and gates out of
one piece of ground into another.

But this was not all; for now I not only had goat’s flesh to feed on when
I pleased, but milk too—a thing which, indeed, in the beginning, I did
not so much as think of, and which, when it came into my thoughts, was
really an agreeable surprise, for now I set up my dairy, and had
sometimes a gallon or two of milk in a day.  And as Nature, who gives
supplies of food to every creature, dictates even naturally how to make
use of it, so I, that had never milked a cow, much less a goat, or seen
butter or cheese made only when I was a boy, after a great many essays
and miscarriages, made both butter and cheese at last, also salt (though
I found it partly made to my hand by the heat of the sun upon some of the
rocks of the sea), and never wanted it afterwards.  How mercifully can
our Creator treat His creatures, even in those conditions in which they
seemed to be overwhelmed in destruction!  How can He sweeten the
bitterest providences, and give us cause to praise Him for dungeons and
prisons!  What a table was here spread for me in the wilderness, where I
saw nothing at first but to perish for hunger!




CHAPTER XI—FINDS PRINT OF MAN’S FOOT ON THE SAND


It would have made a Stoic smile to have seen me and my little family sit
down to dinner.  There was my majesty the prince and lord of the whole
island; I had the lives of all my subjects at my absolute command; I
could hang, draw, give liberty, and take it away, and no rebels among all
my subjects.  Then, to see how like a king I dined, too, all alone,
attended by my servants!  Poll, as if he had been my favourite, was the
only person permitted to talk to me.  My dog, who was now grown old and
crazy, and had found no species to multiply his kind upon, sat always at
my right hand; and two cats, one on one side of the table and one on the
other, expecting now and then a bit from my hand, as a mark of especial
favour.

But these were not the two cats which I brought on shore at first, for
they were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by
my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by I know not what kind of
creature, these were two which I had preserved tame; whereas the rest ran
wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last, for they
would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last I was
obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me.
With this attendance and in this plentiful manner I lived; neither could
I be said to want anything but society; and of that, some time after
this, I was likely to have too much.

I was something impatient, as I have observed, to have the use of my
boat, though very loath to run any more hazards; and therefore sometimes
I sat contriving ways to get her about the island, and at other times I
sat myself down contented enough without her.  But I had a strange
uneasiness in my mind to go down to the point of the island where, as I
have said in my last ramble, I went up the hill to see how the shore lay,
and how the current set, that I might see what I had to do: this
inclination increased upon me every day, and at length I resolved to
travel thither by land, following the edge of the shore.  I did so; but
had any one in England met such a man as I was, it must either have
frightened him, or raised a great deal of laughter; and as I frequently
stood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my
travelling through Yorkshire with such an equipage, and in such a dress.
Be pleased to take a sketch of my figure, as follows.

I had a great high shapeless cap, made of a goat’s skin, with a flap
hanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain
off from running into my neck, nothing being so hurtful in these climates
as the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.

I had a short jacket of goat’s skin, the skirts coming down to about the
middle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same; the
breeches were made of the skin of an old he-goat, whose hair hung down
such a length on either side that, like pantaloons, it reached to the
middle of my legs; stockings and shoes I had none, but had made me a pair
of somethings, I scarce knew what to call them, like buskins, to flap
over my legs, and lace on either side like spatterdashes, but of a most
barbarous shape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.

I had on a broad belt of goat’s skin dried, which I drew together with
two thongs of the same instead of buckles, and in a kind of a frog on
either side of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and
a hatchet, one on one side and one on the other.  I had another belt not
so broad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder,
and at the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of
goat’s skin too, in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot.
At my back I carried my basket, and on my shoulder my gun, and over my
head a great clumsy, ugly, goat’s-skin umbrella, but which, after all,
was the most necessary thing I had about me next to my gun.  As for my
face, the colour of it was really not so mulatto-like as one might expect
from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten
degrees of the equinox.  My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was
about a quarter of a yard long; but as I had both scissors and razors
sufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip,
which I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I
had seen worn by some Turks at Sallee, for the Moors did not wear such,
though the Turks did; of these moustachios, or whiskers, I will not say
they were long enough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length
and shape monstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for
frightful.

But all this is by-the-bye; for as to my figure, I had so few to observe
me that it was of no manner of consequence, so I say no more of that.  In
this kind of dress I went my new journey, and was out five or six days.
I travelled first along the sea-shore, directly to the place where I
first brought my boat to an anchor to get upon the rocks; and having no
boat now to take care of, I went over the land a nearer way to the same
height that I was upon before, when, looking forward to the points of the
rocks which lay out, and which I was obliged to double with my boat, as
is said above, I was surprised to see the sea all smooth and quiet—no
rippling, no motion, no current, any more there than in other places.  I
was at a strange loss to understand this, and resolved to spend some time
in the observing it, to see if nothing from the sets of the tide had
occasioned it; but I was presently convinced how it was—viz. that the
tide of ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of waters
from some great river on the shore, must be the occasion of this current,
and that, according as the wind blew more forcibly from the west or from
the north, this current came nearer or went farther from the shore; for,
waiting thereabouts till evening, I went up to the rock again, and then
the tide of ebb being made, I plainly saw the current again as before,
only that it ran farther off, being near half a league from the shore,
whereas in my case it set close upon the shore, and hurried me and my
canoe along with it, which at another time it would not have done.

This observation convinced me that I had nothing to do but to observe the
ebbing and the flowing of the tide, and I might very easily bring my boat
about the island again; but when I began to think of putting it in
practice, I had such terror upon my spirits at the remembrance of the
danger I had been in, that I could not think of it again with any
patience, but, on the contrary, I took up another resolution, which was
more safe, though more laborious—and this was, that I would build, or
rather make, me another periagua or canoe, and so have one for one side
of the island, and one for the other.

You are to understand that now I had, as I may call it, two plantations
in the island—one my little fortification or tent, with the wall about
it, under the rock, with the cave behind me, which by this time I had
enlarged into several apartments or caves, one within another.  One of
these, which was the driest and largest, and had a door out beyond my
wall or fortification—that is to say, beyond where my wall joined to the
rock—was all filled up with the large earthen pots of which I have given
an account, and with fourteen or fifteen great baskets, which would hold
five or six bushels each, where I laid up my stores of provisions,
especially my corn, some in the ear, cut off short from the straw, and
the other rubbed out with my hand.

As for my wall, made, as before, with long stakes or piles, those piles
grew all like trees, and were by this time grown so big, and spread so
very much, that there was not the least appearance, to any one’s view, of
any habitation behind them.

Near this dwelling of mine, but a little farther within the land, and
upon lower ground, lay my two pieces of corn land, which I kept duly
cultivated and sowed, and which duly yielded me their harvest in its
season; and whenever I had occasion for more corn, I had more land
adjoining as fit as that.

Besides this, I had my country seat, and I had now a tolerable plantation
there also; for, first, I had my little bower, as I called it, which I
kept in repair—that is to say, I kept the hedge which encircled it in
constantly fitted up to its usual height, the ladder standing always in
the inside.  I kept the trees, which at first were no more than stakes,
but were now grown very firm and tall, always cut, so that they might
spread and grow thick and wild, and make the more agreeable shade, which
they did effectually to my mind.  In the middle of this I had my tent
always standing, being a piece of a sail spread over poles, set up for
that purpose, and which never wanted any repair or renewing; and under
this I had made me a squab or couch with the skins of the creatures I had
killed, and with other soft things, and a blanket laid on them, such as
belonged to our sea-bedding, which I had saved; and a great watch-coat to
cover me.  And here, whenever I had occasion to be absent from my chief
seat, I took up my country habitation.

Adjoining to this I had my enclosures for my cattle, that is to say my
goats, and I had taken an inconceivable deal of pains to fence and
enclose this ground.  I was so anxious to see it kept entire, lest the
goats should break through, that I never left off till, with infinite
labour, I had stuck the outside of the hedge so full of small stakes, and
so near to one another, that it was rather a pale than a hedge, and there
was scarce room to put a hand through between them; which afterwards,
when those stakes grew, as they all did in the next rainy season, made
the enclosure strong like a wall, indeed stronger than any wall.

This will testify for me that I was not idle, and that I spared no pains
to bring to pass whatever appeared necessary for my comfortable support,
for I considered the keeping up a breed of tame creatures thus at my hand
would be a living magazine of flesh, milk, butter, and cheese for me as
long as I lived in the place, if it were to be forty years; and that
keeping them in my reach depended entirely upon my perfecting my
enclosures to such a degree that I might be sure of keeping them
together; which by this method, indeed, I so effectually secured, that
when these little stakes began to grow, I had planted them so very thick
that I was forced to pull some of them up again.

In this place also I had my grapes growing, which I principally depended
on for my winter store of raisins, and which I never failed to preserve
very carefully, as the best and most agreeable dainty of my whole diet;
and indeed they were not only agreeable, but medicinal, wholesome,
nourishing, and refreshing to the last degree.

As this was also about half-way between my other habitation and the place
where I had laid up my boat, I generally stayed and lay here in my way
thither, for I used frequently to visit my boat; and I kept all things
about or belonging to her in very good order.  Sometimes I went out in
her to divert myself, but no more hazardous voyages would I go, scarcely
ever above a stone’s cast or two from the shore, I was so apprehensive of
being hurried out of my knowledge again by the currents or winds, or any
other accident.  But now I come to a new scene of my life.  It happened
one day, about noon, going towards my boat, I was exceedingly surprised
with the print of a man’s naked foot on the shore, which was very plain
to be seen on the sand.  I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had
seen an apparition.  I listened, I looked round me, but I could hear
nothing, nor see anything; I went up to a rising ground to look farther;
I went up the shore and down the shore, but it was all one; I could see
no other impression but that one.  I went to it again to see if there
were any more, and to observe if it might not be my fancy; but there was
no room for that, for there was exactly the print of a foot—toes, heel,
and every part of a foot.  How it came thither I knew not, nor could I in
the least imagine; but after innumerable fluttering thoughts, like a man
perfectly confused and out of myself, I came home to my fortification,
not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but terrified to the last
degree, looking behind me at every two or three steps, mistaking every
bush and tree, and fancying every stump at a distance to be a man.  Nor
is it possible to describe how many various shapes my affrighted
imagination represented things to me in, how many wild ideas were found
every moment in my fancy, and what strange, unaccountable whimsies came
into my thoughts by the way.

When I came to my castle (for so I think I called it ever after this), I
fled into it like one pursued.  Whether I went over by the ladder, as
first contrived, or went in at the hole in the rock, which I had called a
door, I cannot remember; no, nor could I remember the next morning, for
never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of
mind than I to this retreat.

I slept none that night; the farther I was from the occasion of my
fright, the greater my apprehensions were, which is something contrary to
the nature of such things, and especially to the usual practice of all
creatures in fear; but I was so embarrassed with my own frightful ideas
of the thing, that I formed nothing but dismal imaginations to myself,
even though I was now a great way off.  Sometimes I fancied it must be
the devil, and reason joined in with me in this supposition, for how
should any other thing in human shape come into the place?  Where was the
vessel that brought them?  What marks were there of any other footstep?
And how was it possible a man should come there?  But then, to think that
Satan should take human shape upon him in such a place, where there could
be no manner of occasion for it, but to leave the print of his foot
behind him, and that even for no purpose too, for he could not be sure I
should see it—this was an amusement the other way.  I considered that the
devil might have found out abundance of other ways to have terrified me
than this of the single print of a foot; that as I lived quite on the
other side of the island, he would never have been so simple as to leave
a mark in a place where it was ten thousand to one whether I should ever
see it or not, and in the sand too, which the first surge of the sea,
upon a high wind, would have defaced entirely.  All this seemed
inconsistent with the thing itself and with all the notions we usually
entertain of the subtlety of the devil.

Abundance of such things as these assisted to argue me out of all
apprehensions of its being the devil; and I presently concluded then that
it must be some more dangerous creature—viz. that it must be some of the
savages of the mainland opposite who had wandered out to sea in their
canoes, and either driven by the currents or by contrary winds, had made
the island, and had been on shore, but were gone away again to sea; being
as loath, perhaps, to have stayed in this desolate island as I would have
been to have had them.

While these reflections were rolling in my mind, I was very thankful in
my thoughts that I was so happy as not to be thereabouts at that time, or
that they did not see my boat, by which they would have concluded that
some inhabitants had been in the place, and perhaps have searched farther
for me.  Then terrible thoughts racked my imagination about their having
found out my boat, and that there were people here; and that, if so, I
should certainly have them come again in greater numbers and devour me;
that if it should happen that they should not find me, yet they would
find my enclosure, destroy all my corn, and carry away all my flock of
tame goats, and I should perish at last for mere want.

Thus my fear banished all my religious hope, all that former confidence
in God, which was founded upon such wonderful experience as I had had of
His goodness; as if He that had fed me by miracle hitherto could not
preserve, by His power, the provision which He had made for me by His
goodness.  I reproached myself with my laziness, that would not sow any
more corn one year than would just serve me till the next season, as if
no accident could intervene to prevent my enjoying the crop that was upon
the ground; and this I thought so just a reproof, that I resolved for the
future to have two or three years’ corn beforehand; so that, whatever
might come, I might not perish for want of bread.

How strange a chequer-work of Providence is the life of man! and by what
secret different springs are the affections hurried about, as different
circumstances present!  To-day we love what to-morrow we hate; to-day we
seek what to-morrow we shun; to-day we desire what to-morrow we fear,
nay, even tremble at the apprehensions of.  This was exemplified in me,
at this time, in the most lively manner imaginable; for I, whose only
affliction was that I seemed banished from human society, that I was
alone, circumscribed by the boundless ocean, cut off from mankind, and
condemned to what I call silent life; that I was as one whom Heaven
thought not worthy to be numbered among the living, or to appear among
the rest of His creatures; that to have seen one of my own species would
have seemed to me a raising me from death to life, and the greatest
blessing that Heaven itself, next to the supreme blessing of salvation,
could bestow; I say, that I should now tremble at the very apprehensions
of seeing a man, and was ready to sink into the ground at but the shadow
or silent appearance of a man having set his foot in the island.

Such is the uneven state of human life; and it afforded me a great many
curious speculations afterwards, when I had a little recovered my first
surprise.  I considered that this was the station of life the infinitely
wise and good providence of God had determined for me; that as I could
not foresee what the ends of Divine wisdom might be in all this, so I was
not to dispute His sovereignty; who, as I was His creature, had an
undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me absolutely as
He thought fit; and who, as I was a creature that had offended Him, had
likewise a judicial right to condemn me to what punishment He thought
fit; and that it was my part to submit to bear His indignation, because I
had sinned against Him.  I then reflected, that as God, who was not only
righteous but omnipotent, had thought fit thus to punish and afflict me,
so He was able to deliver me: that if He did not think fit to do so, it
was my unquestioned duty to resign myself absolutely and entirely to His
will; and, on the other hand, it was my duty also to hope in Him, pray to
Him, and quietly to attend to the dictates and directions of His daily
providence.

These thoughts took me up many hours, days, nay, I may say weeks and
months: and one particular effect of my cogitations on this occasion I
cannot omit.  One morning early, lying in my bed, and filled with
thoughts about my danger from the appearances of savages, I found it
discomposed me very much; upon which these words of the Scripture came
into my thoughts, “Call upon Me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.”  Upon this, rising cheerfully out of my
bed, my heart was not only comforted, but I was guided and encouraged to
pray earnestly to God for deliverance: when I had done praying I took up
my Bible, and opening it to read, the first words that presented to me
were, “Wait on the Lord, and be of good cheer, and He shall strengthen
thy heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.”  It is impossible to express the
comfort this gave me.  In answer, I thankfully laid down the book, and
was no more sad, at least on that occasion.

In the middle of these cogitations, apprehensions, and reflections, it
came into my thoughts one day that all this might be a mere chimera of my
own, and that this foot might be the print of my own foot, when I came on
shore from my boat: this cheered me up a little, too, and I began to
persuade myself it was all a delusion; that it was nothing else but my
own foot; and why might I not come that way from the boat, as well as I
was going that way to the boat?  Again, I considered also that I could by
no means tell for certain where I had trod, and where I had not; and that
if, at last, this was only the print of my own foot, I had played the
part of those fools who try to make stories of spectres and apparitions,
and then are frightened at them more than anybody.

Now I began to take courage, and to peep abroad again, for I had not
stirred out of my castle for three days and nights, so that I began to
starve for provisions; for I had little or nothing within doors but some
barley-cakes and water; then I knew that my goats wanted to be milked
too, which usually was my evening diversion: and the poor creatures were
in great pain and inconvenience for want of it; and, indeed, it almost
spoiled some of them, and almost dried up their milk.  Encouraging
myself, therefore, with the belief that this was nothing but the print of
one of my own feet, and that I might be truly said to start at my own
shadow, I began to go abroad again, and went to my country house to milk
my flock: but to see with what fear I went forward, how often I looked
behind me, how I was ready every now and then to lay down my basket and
run for my life, it would have made any one have thought I was haunted
with an evil conscience, or that I had been lately most terribly
frightened; and so, indeed, I had.  However, I went down thus two or
three days, and having seen nothing, I began to be a little bolder, and
to think there was really nothing in it but my own imagination; but I
could not persuade myself fully of this till I should go down to the
shore again, and see this print of a foot, and measure it by my own, and
see if there was any similitude or fitness, that I might be assured it
was my own foot: but when I came to the place, first, it appeared
evidently to me, that when I laid up my boat I could not possibly be on
shore anywhere thereabouts; secondly, when I came to measure the mark
with my own foot, I found my foot not so large by a great deal.  Both
these things filled my head with new imaginations, and gave me the
vapours again to the highest degree, so that I shook with cold like one
in an ague; and I went home again, filled with the belief that some man
or men had been on shore there; or, in short, that the island was
inhabited, and I might be surprised before I was aware; and what course
to take for my security I knew not.

Oh, what ridiculous resolutions men take when possessed with fear!  It
deprives them of the use of those means which reason offers for their
relief.  The first thing I proposed to myself was, to throw down my
enclosures, and turn all my tame cattle wild into the woods, lest the
enemy should find them, and then frequent the island in prospect of the
same or the like booty: then the simple thing of digging up my two
corn-fields, lest they should find such a grain there, and still be
prompted to frequent the island: then to demolish my bower and tent, that
they might not see any vestiges of habitation, and be prompted to look
farther, in order to find out the persons inhabiting.

These were the subject of the first night’s cogitations after I was come
home again, while the apprehensions which had so overrun my mind were
fresh upon me, and my head was full of vapours.  Thus, fear of danger is
ten thousand times more terrifying than danger itself, when apparent to
the eyes; and we find the burden of anxiety greater, by much, than the
evil which we are anxious about: and what was worse than all this, I had
not that relief in this trouble that from the resignation I used to
practise I hoped to have.  I looked, I thought, like Saul, who complained
not only that the Philistines were upon him, but that God had forsaken
him; for I did not now take due ways to compose my mind, by crying to God
in my distress, and resting upon His providence, as I had done before,
for my defence and deliverance; which, if I had done, I had at least been
more cheerfully supported under this new surprise, and perhaps carried
through it with more resolution.

This confusion of my thoughts kept me awake all night; but in the morning
I fell asleep; and having, by the amusement of my mind, been as it were
tired, and my spirits exhausted, I slept very soundly, and waked much
better composed than I had ever been before.  And now I began to think
sedately; and, upon debate with myself, I concluded that this island
(which was so exceedingly pleasant, fruitful, and no farther from the
mainland than as I had seen) was not so entirely abandoned as I might
imagine; that although there were no stated inhabitants who lived on the
spot, yet that there might sometimes come boats off from the shore, who,
either with design, or perhaps never but when they were driven by cross
winds, might come to this place; that I had lived there fifteen years now
and had not met with the least shadow or figure of any people yet; and
that, if at any time they should be driven here, it was probable they
went away again as soon as ever they could, seeing they had never thought
fit to fix here upon any occasion; that the most I could suggest any
danger from was from any casual accidental landing of straggling people
from the main, who, as it was likely, if they were driven hither, were
here against their wills, so they made no stay here, but went off again
with all possible speed; seldom staying one night on shore, lest they
should not have the help of the tides and daylight back again; and that,
therefore, I had nothing to do but to consider of some safe retreat, in
case I should see any savages land upon the spot.

Now, I began sorely to repent that I had dug my cave so large as to bring
a door through again, which door, as I said, came out beyond where my
fortification joined to the rock: upon maturely considering this,
therefore, I resolved to draw me a second fortification, in the manner of
a semicircle, at a distance from my wall, just where I had planted a
double row of trees about twelve years before, of which I made mention:
these trees having been planted so thick before, they wanted but few
piles to be driven between them, that they might be thicker and stronger,
and my wall would be soon finished.  So that I had now a double wall; and
my outer wall was thickened with pieces of timber, old cables, and
everything I could think of, to make it strong; having in it seven little
holes, about as big as I might put my arm out at.  In the inside of this
I thickened my wall to about ten feet thick with continually bringing
earth out of my cave, and laying it at the foot of the wall, and walking
upon it; and through the seven holes I contrived to plant the muskets, of
which I took notice that I had got seven on shore out of the ship; these
I planted like my cannon, and fitted them into frames, that held them
like a carriage, so that I could fire all the seven guns in two minutes’
time; this wall I was many a weary month in finishing, and yet never
thought myself safe till it was done.

When this was done I stuck all the ground without my wall, for a great
length every way, as full with stakes or sticks of the osier-like wood,
which I found so apt to grow, as they could well stand; insomuch that I
believe I might set in near twenty thousand of them, leaving a pretty
large space between them and my wall, that I might have room to see an
enemy, and they might have no shelter from the young trees, if they
attempted to approach my outer wall.

Thus in two years’ time I had a thick grove; and in five or six years’
time I had a wood before my dwelling, growing so monstrously thick and
strong that it was indeed perfectly impassable: and no men, of what kind
soever, could ever imagine that there was anything beyond it, much less a
habitation.  As for the way which I proposed to myself to go in and out
(for I left no avenue), it was by setting two ladders, one to a part of
the rock which was low, and then broke in, and left room to place another
ladder upon that; so when the two ladders were taken down no man living
could come down to me without doing himself mischief; and if they had
come down, they were still on the outside of my outer wall.

Thus I took all the measures human prudence could suggest for my own
preservation; and it will be seen at length that they were not altogether
without just reason; though I foresaw nothing at that time more than my
mere fear suggested to me.




CHAPTER XII—A CAVE RETREAT


While this was doing, I was not altogether careless of my other affairs;
for I had a great concern upon me for my little herd of goats: they were
not only a ready supply to me on every occasion, and began to be
sufficient for me, without the expense of powder and shot, but also
without the fatigue of hunting after the wild ones; and I was loath to
lose the advantage of them, and to have them all to nurse up over again.

For this purpose, after long consideration, I could think of but two ways
to preserve them: one was, to find another convenient place to dig a cave
underground, and to drive them into it every night; and the other was to
enclose two or three little bits of land, remote from one another, and as
much concealed as I could, where I might keep about half-a-dozen young
goats in each place; so that if any disaster happened to the flock in
general, I might be able to raise them again with little trouble and
time: and this though it would require a good deal of time and labour, I
thought was the most rational design.

Accordingly, I spent some time to find out the most retired parts of the
island; and I pitched upon one, which was as private, indeed, as my heart
could wish: it was a little damp piece of ground in the middle of the
hollow and thick woods, where, as is observed, I almost lost myself once
before, endeavouring to come back that way from the eastern part of the
island.  Here I found a clear piece of land, near three acres, so
surrounded with woods that it was almost an enclosure by nature; at
least, it did not want near so much labour to make it so as the other
piece of ground I had worked so hard at.

I immediately went to work with this piece of ground; and in less than a
month’s time I had so fenced it round that my flock, or herd, call it
which you please, which were not so wild now as at first they might be
supposed to be, were well enough secured in it: so, without any further
delay, I removed ten young she-goats and two he-goats to this piece, and
when they were there I continued to perfect the fence till I had made it
as secure as the other; which, however, I did at more leisure, and it
took me up more time by a great deal.  All this labour I was at the
expense of, purely from my apprehensions on account of the print of a
man’s foot; for as yet I had never seen any human creature come near the
island; and I had now lived two years under this uneasiness, which,
indeed, made my life much less comfortable than it was before, as may be
well imagined by any who know what it is to live in the constant snare of
the fear of man.  And this I must observe, with grief, too, that the
discomposure of my mind had great impression also upon the religious part
of my thoughts; for the dread and terror of falling into the hands of
savages and cannibals lay so upon my spirits, that I seldom found myself
in a due temper for application to my Maker; at least, not with the
sedate calmness and resignation of soul which I was wont to do: I rather
prayed to God as under great affliction and pressure of mind, surrounded
with danger, and in expectation every night of being murdered and
devoured before morning; and I must testify, from my experience, that a
temper of peace, thankfulness, love, and affection, is much the more
proper frame for prayer than that of terror and discomposure: and that
under the dread of mischief impending, a man is no more fit for a
comforting performance of the duty of praying to God than he is for a
repentance on a sick-bed; for these discomposures affect the mind, as the
others do the body; and the discomposure of the mind must necessarily be
as great a disability as that of the body, and much greater; praying to
God being properly an act of the mind, not of the body.

But to go on.  After I had thus secured one part of my little living
stock, I went about the whole island, searching for another private place
to make such another deposit; when, wandering more to the west point of
the island than I had ever done yet, and looking out to sea, I thought I
saw a boat upon the sea, at a great distance.  I had found a perspective
glass or two in one of the seamen’s chests, which I saved out of our
ship, but I had it not about me; and this was so remote that I could not
tell what to make of it, though I looked at it till my eyes were not able
to hold to look any longer; whether it was a boat or not I do not know,
but as I descended from the hill I could see no more of it, so I gave it
over; only I resolved to go no more out without a perspective glass in my
pocket.  When I was come down the hill to the end of the island, where,
indeed, I had never been before, I was presently convinced that the
seeing the print of a man’s foot was not such a strange thing in the
island as I imagined: and but that it was a special providence that I was
cast upon the side of the island where the savages never came, I should
easily have known that nothing was more frequent than for the canoes from
the main, when they happened to be a little too far out at sea, to shoot
over to that side of the island for harbour: likewise, as they often met
and fought in their canoes, the victors, having taken any prisoners,
would bring them over to this shore, where, according to their dreadful
customs, being all cannibals, they would kill and eat them; of which
hereafter.

When I was come down the hill to the shore, as I said above, being the
SW. point of the island, I was perfectly confounded and amazed; nor is it
possible for me to express the horror of my mind at seeing the shore
spread with skulls, hands, feet, and other bones of human bodies; and
particularly I observed a place where there had been a fire made, and a
circle dug in the earth, like a cockpit, where I supposed the savage
wretches had sat down to their human feastings upon the bodies of their
fellow-creatures.

I was so astonished with the sight of these things, that I entertained no
notions of any danger to myself from it for a long while: all my
apprehensions were buried in the thoughts of such a pitch of inhuman,
hellish brutality, and the horror of the degeneracy of human nature,
which, though I had heard of it often, yet I never had so near a view of
before; in short, I turned away my face from the horrid spectacle; my
stomach grew sick, and I was just at the point of fainting, when nature
discharged the disorder from my stomach; and having vomited with uncommon
violence, I was a little relieved, but could not bear to stay in the
place a moment; so I got up the hill again with all the speed I could,
and walked on towards my own habitation.

When I came a little out of that part of the island I stood still awhile,
as amazed, and then, recovering myself, I looked up with the utmost
affection of my soul, and, with a flood of tears in my eyes, gave God
thanks, that had cast my first lot in a part of the world where I was
distinguished from such dreadful creatures as these; and that, though I
had esteemed my present condition very miserable, had yet given me so
many comforts in it that I had still more to give thanks for than to
complain of: and this, above all, that I had, even in this miserable
condition, been comforted with the knowledge of Himself, and the hope of
His blessing: which was a felicity more than sufficiently equivalent to
all the misery which I had suffered, or could suffer.

In this frame of thankfulness I went home to my castle, and began to be
much easier now, as to the safety of my circumstances, than ever I was
before: for I observed that these wretches never came to this island in
search of what they could get; perhaps not seeking, not wanting, or not
expecting anything here; and having often, no doubt, been up the covered,
woody part of it without finding anything to their purpose.  I knew I had
been here now almost eighteen years, and never saw the least footsteps of
human creature there before; and I might be eighteen years more as
entirely concealed as I was now, if I did not discover myself to them,
which I had no manner of occasion to do; it being my only business to
keep myself entirely concealed where I was, unless I found a better sort
of creatures than cannibals to make myself known to.  Yet I entertained
such an abhorrence of the savage wretches that I have been speaking of,
and of the wretched, inhuman custom of their devouring and eating one
another up, that I continued pensive and sad, and kept close within my
own circle for almost two years after this: when I say my own circle, I
mean by it my three plantations—viz. my castle, my country seat (which I
called my bower), and my enclosure in the woods: nor did I look after
this for any other use than an enclosure for my goats; for the aversion
which nature gave me to these hellish wretches was such, that I was as
fearful of seeing them as of seeing the devil himself.  I did not so much
as go to look after my boat all this time, but began rather to think of
making another; for I could not think of ever making any more attempts to
bring the other boat round the island to me, lest I should meet with some
of these creatures at sea; in which case, if I had happened to have
fallen into their hands, I knew what would have been my lot.

Time, however, and the satisfaction I had that I was in no danger of
being discovered by these people, began to wear off my uneasiness about
them; and I began to live just in the same composed manner as before,
only with this difference, that I used more caution, and kept my eyes
more about me than I did before, lest I should happen to be seen by any
of them; and particularly, I was more cautious of firing my gun, lest any
of them, being on the island, should happen to hear it.  It was,
therefore, a very good providence to me that I had furnished myself with
a tame breed of goats, and that I had no need to hunt any more about the
woods, or shoot at them; and if I did catch any of them after this, it
was by traps and snares, as I had done before; so that for two years
after this I believe I never fired my gun once off, though I never went
out without it; and what was more, as I had saved three pistols out of
the ship, I always carried them out with me, or at least two of them,
sticking them in my goat-skin belt.  I also furbished up one of the great
cutlasses that I had out of the ship, and made me a belt to hang it on
also; so that I was now a most formidable fellow to look at when I went
abroad, if you add to the former description of myself the particular of
two pistols, and a broadsword hanging at my side in a belt, but without a
scabbard.

Things going on thus, as I have said, for some time, I seemed, excepting
these cautions, to be reduced to my former calm, sedate way of living.
All these things tended to show me more and more how far my condition was
from being miserable, compared to some others; nay, to many other
particulars of life which it might have pleased God to have made my lot.
It put me upon reflecting how little repining there would be among
mankind at any condition of life if people would rather compare their
condition with those that were worse, in order to be thankful, than be
always comparing them with those which are better, to assist their
murmurings and complainings.

As in my present condition there were not really many things which I
wanted, so indeed I thought that the frights I had been in about these
savage wretches, and the concern I had been in for my own preservation,
had taken off the edge of my invention, for my own conveniences; and I
had dropped a good design, which I had once bent my thoughts upon, and
that was to try if I could not make some of my barley into malt, and then
try to brew myself some beer.  This was really a whimsical thought, and I
reproved myself often for the simplicity of it: for I presently saw there
would be the want of several things necessary to the making my beer that
it would be impossible for me to supply; as, first, casks to preserve it
in, which was a thing that, as I have observed already, I could never
compass: no, though I spent not only many days, but weeks, nay months, in
attempting it, but to no purpose.  In the next place, I had no hops to
make it keep, no yeast to make it work, no copper or kettle to make it
boil; and yet with all these things wanting, I verily believe, had not
the frights and terrors I was in about the savages intervened, I had
undertaken it, and perhaps brought it to pass too; for I seldom gave
anything over without accomplishing it, when once I had it in my head to
began it.  But my invention now ran quite another way; for night and day
I could think of nothing but how I might destroy some of the monsters in
their cruel, bloody entertainment, and if possible save the victim they
should bring hither to destroy.  It would take up a larger volume than
this whole work is intended to be to set down all the contrivances I
hatched, or rather brooded upon, in my thoughts, for the destroying these
creatures, or at least frightening them so as to prevent their coming
hither any more: but all this was abortive; nothing could be possible to
take effect, unless I was to be there to do it myself: and what could one
man do among them, when perhaps there might be twenty or thirty of them
together with their darts, or their bows and arrows, with which they
could shoot as true to a mark as I could with my gun?

Sometimes I thought if digging a hole under the place where they made
their fire, and putting in five or six pounds of gunpowder, which, when
they kindled their fire, would consequently take fire, and blow up all
that was near it: but as, in the first place, I should be unwilling to
waste so much powder upon them, my store being now within the quantity of
one barrel, so neither could I be sure of its going off at any certain
time, when it might surprise them; and, at best, that it would do little
more than just blow the fire about their ears and fright them, but not
sufficient to make them forsake the place: so I laid it aside; and then
proposed that I would place myself in ambush in some convenient place,
with my three guns all double-loaded, and in the middle of their bloody
ceremony let fly at them, when I should be sure to kill or wound perhaps
two or three at every shot; and then falling in upon them with my three
pistols and my sword, I made no doubt but that, if there were twenty, I
should kill them all.  This fancy pleased my thoughts for some weeks, and
I was so full of it that I often dreamed of it, and, sometimes, that I
was just going to let fly at them in my sleep.  I went so far with it in
my imagination that I employed myself several days to find out proper
places to put myself in ambuscade, as I said, to watch for them, and I
went frequently to the place itself, which was now grown more familiar to
me; but while my mind was thus filled with thoughts of revenge and a
bloody putting twenty or thirty of them to the sword, as I may call it,
the horror I had at the place, and at the signals of the barbarous
wretches devouring one another, abetted my malice.  Well, at length I
found a place in the side of the hill where I was satisfied I might
securely wait till I saw any of their boats coming; and might then, even
before they would be ready to come on shore, convey myself unseen into
some thickets of trees, in one of which there was a hollow large enough
to conceal me entirely; and there I might sit and observe all their
bloody doings, and take my full aim at their heads, when they were so
close together as that it would be next to impossible that I should miss
my shot, or that I could fail wounding three or four of them at the first
shot.  In this place, then, I resolved to fulfil my design; and
accordingly I prepared two muskets and my ordinary fowling-piece.  The
two muskets I loaded with a brace of slugs each, and four or five smaller
bullets, about the size of pistol bullets; and the fowling-piece I loaded
with near a handful of swan-shot of the largest size; I also loaded my
pistols with about four bullets each; and, in this posture, well provided
with ammunition for a second and third charge, I prepared myself for my
expedition.

After I had thus laid the scheme of my design, and in my imagination put
it in practice, I continually made my tour every morning to the top of
the hill, which was from my castle, as I called it, about three miles or
more, to see if I could observe any boats upon the sea, coming near the
island, or standing over towards it; but I began to tire of this hard
duty, after I had for two or three months constantly kept my watch, but
came always back without any discovery; there having not, in all that
time, been the least appearance, not only on or near the shore, but on
the whole ocean, so far as my eye or glass could reach every way.

As long as I kept my daily tour to the hill, to look out, so long also I
kept up the vigour of my design, and my spirits seemed to be all the
while in a suitable frame for so outrageous an execution as the killing
twenty or thirty naked savages, for an offence which I had not at all
entered into any discussion of in my thoughts, any farther than my
passions were at first fired by the horror I conceived at the unnatural
custom of the people of that country, who, it seems, had been suffered by
Providence, in His wise disposition of the world, to have no other guide
than that of their own abominable and vitiated passions; and consequently
were left, and perhaps had been so for some ages, to act such horrid
things, and receive such dreadful customs, as nothing but nature,
entirely abandoned by Heaven, and actuated by some hellish degeneracy,
could have run them into.  But now, when, as I have said, I began to be
weary of the fruitless excursion which I had made so long and so far
every morning in vain, so my opinion of the action itself began to alter;
and I began, with cooler and calmer thoughts, to consider what I was
going to engage in; what authority or call I had to pretend to be judge
and executioner upon these men as criminals, whom Heaven had thought fit
for so many ages to suffer unpunished to go on, and to be as it were the
executioners of His judgments one upon another; how far these people were
offenders against me, and what right I had to engage in the quarrel of
that blood which they shed promiscuously upon one another.  I debated
this very often with myself thus: “How do I know what God Himself judges
in this particular case?  It is certain these people do not commit this
as a crime; it is not against their own consciences reproving, or their
light reproaching them; they do not know it to be an offence, and then
commit it in defiance of divine justice, as we do in almost all the sins
we commit.  They think it no more a crime to kill a captive taken in war
than we do to kill an ox; or to eat human flesh than we do to eat
mutton.”

When I considered this a little, it followed necessarily that I was
certainly in the wrong; that these people were not murderers, in the
sense that I had before condemned them in my thoughts, any more than
those Christians were murderers who often put to death the prisoners
taken in battle; or more frequently, upon many occasions, put whole
troops of men to the sword, without giving quarter, though they threw
down their arms and submitted.  In the next place, it occurred to me that
although the usage they gave one another was thus brutish and inhuman,
yet it was really nothing to me: these people had done me no injury: that
if they attempted, or I saw it necessary, for my immediate preservation,
to fall upon them, something might be said for it: but that I was yet out
of their power, and they really had no knowledge of me, and consequently
no design upon me; and therefore it could not be just for me to fall upon
them; that this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their
barbarities practised in America, where they destroyed millions of these
people; who, however they were idolators and barbarians, and had several
bloody and barbarous rites in their customs, such as sacrificing human
bodies to their idols, were yet, as to the Spaniards, very innocent
people; and that the rooting them out of the country is spoken of with
the utmost abhorrence and detestation by even the Spaniards themselves at
this time, and by all other Christian nations of Europe, as a mere
butchery, a bloody and unnatural piece of cruelty, unjustifiable either
to God or man; and for which the very name of a Spaniard is reckoned to
be frightful and terrible, to all people of humanity or of Christian
compassion; as if the kingdom of Spain were particularly eminent for the
produce of a race of men who were without principles of tenderness, or
the common bowels of pity to the miserable, which is reckoned to be a
mark of generous temper in the mind.

These considerations really put me to a pause, and to a kind of a full
stop; and I began by little and little to be off my design, and to
conclude I had taken wrong measures in my resolution to attack the
savages; and that it was not my business to meddle with them, unless they
first attacked me; and this it was my business, if possible, to prevent:
but that, if I were discovered and attacked by them, I knew my duty.  On
the other hand, I argued with myself that this really was the way not to
deliver myself, but entirely to ruin and destroy myself; for unless I was
sure to kill every one that not only should be on shore at that time, but
that should ever come on shore afterwards, if but one of them escaped to
tell their country-people what had happened, they would come over again
by thousands to revenge the death of their fellows, and I should only
bring upon myself a certain destruction, which, at present, I had no
manner of occasion for.  Upon the whole, I concluded that I ought,

AUTHOR'S PREFACE


The history of this beautiful lady is to speak for itself; if it is not
as beautiful as the lady herself is reported to be; if it is not as
diverting as the reader can desire, and much more than he can reasonably
expect; and if all the most diverting parts of it are not adapted to the
instruction and improvement of the reader, the relator says it must be
from the defect of his performance; dressing up the story in worse
clothes than the lady whose words he speaks, prepared for the world.

He takes the liberty to say that this story differs from most of the
modern performances of this kind, though some of them have met with a
very good reception in the world. I say, it differs from them in this
great and essential article, namely, that the foundation of this is laid
in truth of fact; and so the work is not a story, but a history.

The scene is laid so near the place where the main part of it was
transacted that it was necessary to conceal names and persons, lest what
cannot be yet entirely forgot in that part of the town should be
remembered, and the facts traced back too plainly by the many people
yet living, who would know the persons by the particulars.

It is not always necessary that the names of persons should be
discovered, though the history may be many ways useful; and if we should
be always obliged to name the persons, or not to relate the story, the
consequence might be only this--that many a pleasant and delightful
history would be buried in the dark, and the world deprived both of the
pleasure and the profit of it.

The writer says he was particularly acquainted with this lady's first
husband, the brewer, and with his father, and also with his bad
circumstances, and knows that first part of the story to be truth.

This may, he hopes, be a pledge for the credit of the rest, though the
latter part of her history lay abroad, and could not be so well vouched
as the first; yet, as she has told it herself, we have the less reason
to question the truth of that part also.

In the manner she has told the story, it is evident she does not insist
upon her justification in any one part of it; much less does she
recommend her conduct, or, indeed, any part of it, except her
repentance, to our imitation. On the contrary, she makes frequent
excursions, in a just censuring and condemning her own practice. How
often does she reproach herself in the most passionate manner, and guide
us to just reflections in the like cases!

It is true she met with unexpected success in all her wicked courses;
but even in the highest elevations of her prosperity she makes frequent
acknowledgments that the pleasure of her wickedness was not worth the
repentance; and that all the satisfaction she had, all the joy in the
view of her prosperity--no, nor all the wealth she rolled in, the gaiety
of her appearance, the equipages and the honours she was attended with,
could quiet her mind, abate the reproaches of her conscience, or procure
her an hour's sleep when just reflection kept her waking.

The noble inferences that are drawn from this one part are worth all the
rest of the story, and abundantly justify, as they are the professed
design of, the publication.

If there are any parts in her story which, being obliged to relate a
wicked action, seem to describe it too plainly, the writer says all
imaginable care has been taken to keep clear of indecencies and immodest
expressions; and it is hoped you will find nothing to prompt a vicious
mind, but everywhere much to discourage and expose it.

Scenes of crime can scarce be represented in such a manner but some may
make a criminal use of them; but when vice is painted in its low-prized
colours, it is not to make people in love with it, but to expose it; and
if the reader makes a wrong use of the figures, the wickedness is his
own.

In the meantime, the advantages of the present work are so great, and
the virtuous reader has room for so much improvement, that we make no
question the story, however meanly told, will find a passage to his best
hours, and be read both with profit and delight.




A HISTORY OF THE LIFE OF ROXANA


I was born, as my friends told me, at the city of Poitiers, in the
province or county of Poitou, in France, from whence I was brought to
England by my parents, who fled for their religion about the year 1683,
when the Protestants were banished from France by the cruelty of their
persecutors.

I, who knew little or nothing of what I was brought over hither for, was
well enough pleased with being here. London, a large and gay city, took
with me mighty well, who, from my being a child, loved a crowd, and to
see a great many fine folks.

I retained nothing of France but the language, my father and mother
being people of better fashion than ordinarily the people called
refugees at that time were; and having fled early, while it was easy to
secure their effects, had, before their coming over, remitted
considerable sums of money, or, as I remember, a considerable value in
French brandy, paper, and other goods; and these selling very much to
advantage here, my father was in very good circumstances at his coming
over, so that he was far from applying to the rest of our nation that
were here for countenance and relief. On the contrary, he had his door
continually thronged with miserable objects of the poor starving
creatures who at that time fled hither for shelter on account of
conscience, or something else.

I have indeed heard my father say that he was pestered with a great many
of those who, for any religion they had, might e'en have stayed where
they were, but who flocked over hither in droves, for what they call in
English a livelihood; hearing with what open arms the refugees were
received in England, and how they fell readily into business, being, by
the charitable assistance of the people in London, encouraged to work in
their manufactories in Spitalfields, Canterbury, and other places, and
that they had a much better price for their work than in France, and the
like.

My father, I say, told me that he was more pestered with the clamours of
these people than of those who were truly refugees, and fled in distress
merely for conscience.

I was about ten years old when I was brought over hither, where, as I
have said, my father lived in very good circumstances, and died in about
eleven years more; in which time, as I had accomplished myself for the
sociable part of the world, so I had acquainted myself with some of our
English neighbours, as is the custom in London; and as, while I was
young, I had picked up three or four playfellows and companions suitable
to my years, so, as we grew bigger, we learned to call one another
intimates and friends; and this forwarded very much the finishing me for
conversation and the world.

I went to English schools, and being young, I learned the English tongue
perfectly well, with all the customs of the English young women; so that
I retained nothing of the French but the speech; nor did I so much as
keep any remains of the French language tagged to my way of speaking, as
most foreigners do, but spoke what we call natural English, as if I had
been born here.

Being to give my own character, I must be excused to give it as
impartially as possible, and as if I was speaking of another body; and
the sequel will lead you to judge whether I flatter myself or no.

I was (speaking of myself at about fourteen years of age) tall, and very
well made; sharp as a hawk in matters of common knowledge; quick and
smart in discourse; apt to be satirical; full of repartee; and a little
too forward in conversation, or, as we call it in English, bold, though
perfectly modest in my behaviour. Being French born, I danced, as some
say, naturally, loved it extremely, and sang well also, and so well
that, as you will hear, it was afterwards some advantage to me. With
all these things, I wanted neither wit, beauty, or money. In this manner
I set out into the world, having all the advantages that any young woman
could desire, to recommend me to others, and form a prospect of happy
living to myself.

At about fifteen years of age, my father gave me, as he called it in
French, 25,000 livres, that is to say, two thousand pounds portion, and
married me to an eminent brewer in the city. Pardon me if I conceal his
name; for though he was the foundation of my ruin, I cannot take so
severe a revenge upon him.

With this thing called a husband I lived eight years in good fashion,
and for some part of the time kept a coach, that is to say, a kind of
mock coach; for all the week the horses were kept at work in the
dray-carts; but on Sunday I had the privilege to go abroad in my
chariot, either to church or otherways, as my husband and I could agree
about it, which, by the way, was not very often; but of that hereafter.

Before I proceed in the history of the married part of my life, you must
allow me to give as impartial an account of my husband as I have done of
myself. He was a jolly, handsome fellow, as any woman need wish for a
companion; tall and well made; rather a little too large, but not so as
to be ungenteel; he danced well, which I think was the first thing that
brought us together. He had an old father who managed the business
carefully, so that he had little of that part lay on him, but now and
then to appear and show himself; and he took the advantage of it, for he
troubled himself very little about it, but went abroad, kept company,
hunted much, and loved it exceedingly.

After I have told you that he was a handsome man and a good sportsman, I
have indeed said all; and unhappy was I, like other young people of our
sex, I chose him for being a handsome, jolly fellow, as I have said; for
he was otherwise a weak, empty-headed, untaught creature, as any woman
could ever desire to be coupled with. And here I must take the liberty,
whatever I have to reproach myself with in my after conduct, to turn to
my fellow-creatures, the young ladies of this country, and speak to them
by way of precaution. If you have any regard to your future happiness,
any view of living comfortably with a husband, any hope of preserving
your fortunes, or restoring them after any disaster, never, ladies,
marry a fool; any husband rather than a fool. With some other husbands
you may be unhappy, but with a fool you will be miserable; with another
husband you may, I say, be unhappy, but with a fool you must; nay, if he
would, he cannot make you easy; everything he does is so awkward,
everything he says is so empty, a woman of any sense cannot but be
surfeited and sick of him twenty times a day. What is more shocking than
for a woman to bring a handsome, comely fellow of a husband into
company, and then be obliged to blush for him every time she hears him
speak? to hear other gentlemen talk sense, and he able to say nothing?
and so look like a fool, or, which is worse, hear him talk nonsense, and
be laughed at for a fool.

In the next place, there are so many sorts of fools, such an infinite
variety of fools, and so hard it is to know the worst of the kind, that
I am obliged to say, "No fool, ladies, at all, no kind of fool, whether
a mad fool or a sober fool, a wise fool or a silly fool; take anything
but a fool; nay, be anything, be even an old maid, the worst of nature's
curses, rather than take up with a fool."

But to leave this awhile, for I shall have occasion to speak of it
again; my case was particularly hard, for I had a variety of foolish
things complicated in this unhappy match.

First, and which I must confess is very unsufferable, he was a conceited
fool, _tout opiniatre_; everything he said was right, was best, and was
to the purpose, whoever was in company, and whatever was advanced by
others, though with the greatest modesty imaginable. And yet, when he
came to defend what he had said by argument and reason, he would do it
so weakly, so emptily, and so nothing to the purpose, that it was enough
to make anybody that heard him sick and ashamed of him.

Secondly, he was positive and obstinate, and the most positive in the
most simple and inconsistent things, such as were intolerable to bear.

These two articles, if there had been no more, qualified him to be a
most unbearable creature for a husband; and so it may be supposed at
first sight what a kind of life I led with him. However, I did as well
as I could, and held my tongue, which was the only victory I gained over
him; for when he would talk after his own empty rattling way with me,
and I would not answer, or enter into discourse with him on the point he
was upon, he would rise up in the greatest passion imaginable, and go
away, which was the cheapest way I had to be delivered.

I could enlarge here much upon the method I took to make my life
passable and easy with the most incorrigible temper in the world; but it
is too long, and the articles too trifling. I shall mention some of them
as the circumstances I am to relate shall necessarily bring them in.

After I had been married about four years, my own father died, my mother
having been dead before. He liked my match so ill, and saw so little
room to be satisfied with the conduct of my husband, that though he left
me five thousand livres, and more, at his death, yet he left it in the
hands of my elder brother, who, running on too rashly in his adventures
as a merchant, failed, and lost not only what he had, but what he had
for me too, as you shall hear presently.

Thus I lost the last gift of my father's bounty by having a husband not
fit to be trusted with it: there's one of the benefits of marrying a
fool.

Within two years after my own father's death my husband's father also
died, and, as I thought, left him a considerable addition to his estate,
the whole trade of the brewhouse, which was a very good one, being now
his own.

But this addition to his stock was his ruin, for he had no genius to
business, he had no knowledge of his accounts; he bustled a little about
it, indeed, at first, and put on a face of business, but he soon grew
slack; it was below him to inspect his books, he committed all that to
his clerks and book-keepers; and while he found money in cash to pay the
maltman and the excise, and put some in his pocket, he was perfectly
easy and indolent, let the main chance go how it would.

I foresaw the consequence of this, and attempted several times to
persuade him to apply himself to his business; I put him in mind how his
customers complained of the neglect of his servants on one hand, and how
abundance broke in his debt, on the other hand, for want of the clerk's
care to secure him, and the like; but he thrust me by, either with hard
words, or fraudulently, with representing the cases otherwise than they
were.

However, to cut short a dull story, which ought not to be long, he began
to find his trade sunk, his stock declined, and that, in short, he could
not carry on his business, and once or twice his brewing utensils were
extended for the excise; and, the last time, he was put to great
extremities to clear them.

This alarmed him, and he resolved to lay down his trade; which, indeed,
I was not sorry for; foreseeing that if he did not lay it down in time,
he would be forced to do it another way, namely, as a bankrupt. Also I
was willing he should draw out while he had something left, lest I
should come to be stripped at home, and be turned out of doors with my
children; for I had now five children by him, the only work (perhaps)
that fools are good for.

I thought myself happy when he got another man to take his brewhouse
clear off his hands; for, paying down a large sum of money, my husband
found himself a clear man, all his debts paid, and with between two and
three thousand pounds in his pocket; and being now obliged to remove
from the brewhouse, we took a house at ----, a village about two miles
out of town; and happy I thought myself, all things considered, that I
was got off clear, upon so good terms; and had my handsome fellow had
but one capful of wit, I had been still well enough.

I proposed to him either to buy some place with the money, or with part
of it, and offered to join my part to it, which was then in being, and
might have been secured; so we might have lived tolerably at least
during his life. But as it is the part of a fool to be void of counsel,
so he neglected it, lived on as he did before, kept his horses and men,
rid every day out to the forest a-hunting, and nothing was done all this
while; but the money decreased apace, and I thought I saw my ruin
hastening on without any possible way to prevent it.

I was not wanting with all that persuasions and entreaties could
perform, but it was all fruitless; representing to him how fast our
money wasted, and what would be our condition when it was gone, made no
impression on him; but like one stupid, he went on, not valuing all that
tears and lamentations could be supposed to do; nor did he abate his
figure or equipage, his horses or servants, even to the last, till he
had not a hundred pounds left in the whole world.

It was not above three years that all the ready money was thus spending
off; yet he spent it, as I may say, foolishly too, for he kept no
valuable company neither, but generally with huntsmen and
horse-coursers, and men meaner than himself, which is another
consequence of a man's being a fool; such can never take delight in men
more wise and capable than themselves, and that makes them converse
with scoundrels, drink, belch with porters, and keep company always
below themselves.

This was my wretched condition, when one morning my husband told me he
was sensible he was come to a miserable condition, and he would go and
seek his fortune somewhere or other. He had said something to that
purpose several times before that, upon my pressing him to consider his
circumstances, and the circumstances of his family, before it should be
too late; but as I found he had no meaning in anything of that kind, as,
indeed, he had not much in anything he ever said, so I thought they were
but words of course now. When he had said he would be gone, I used to
wish secretly, and even say in my thoughts, I wish you would, for if you
go on thus you will starve us all.

He stayed, however, at home all that day, and lay at home that night;
early the next morning he gets out of bed, goes to a window which looked
out towards the stable, and sounds his French horn, as he called it,
which was his usual signal to call his men to go out a-hunting.

It was about the latter end of August, and so was light yet at five
o'clock, and it was about that time that I heard him and his two men go
out and shut the yard gates after them. He said nothing to me more than
as usual when he used to go out upon his sport; neither did I rise, or
say anything to him that was material, but went to sleep again after he
was gone, for two hours or thereabouts.

It must be a little surprising to the reader to tell him at once, that
after this I never saw my husband more; but, to go farther, I not only
never saw him more, but I never heard from him, or of him, neither of
any or either of his two servants, or of the horses, either what became
of them, where or which way they went, or what they did or intended to
do, no more than if the ground had opened and swallowed them all up, and
nobody had known it, except as hereafter.

I was not, for the first night or two, at all surprised, no, nor very
much the first week or two, believing that if anything evil had befallen
them, I should soon enough have heard of that; and also knowing, that as
he had two servants and three horses with him, it would be the strangest
thing in the world that anything could befall them all but that I must
some time or other hear of them.

But you will easily allow, that as time ran on, a week, two weeks, a
month, two months, and so on, I was dreadfully frighted at last, and the
more when I looked into my own circumstances, and considered the
condition in which I was left with five children, and not one farthing
subsistence for them, other than about seventy pounds in money, and what
few things of value I had about me, which, though considerable in
themselves, were yet nothing to feed a family, and for a length of time
too.

[Illustration: THE BREWER AND HIS MEN

I heard him and his two men go out and shut the yard gates after them]

What to do I knew not, nor to whom to have recourse: to keep in the
house where I was, I could not, the rent being too great; and to leave
it without his orders, if my husband should return, I could not think of
that neither; so that I continued extremely perplexed, melancholy, and
discouraged to the last degree.

I remained in this dejected condition near a twelvemonth. My husband had
two sisters, who were married, and lived very well, and some other near
relations that I knew of, and I hoped would do something for me; and I
frequently sent to these, to know if they could give me any account of
my vagrant creature. But they all declared to me in answer, that they
knew nothing about him; and, after frequent sending, began to think me
troublesome, and to let me know they thought so too, by their treating
my maid with very slight and unhandsome returns to her inquiries.

This grated hard, and added to my affliction; but I had no recourse but
to my tears, for I had not a friend of my own left me in the world. I
should have observed, that it was about half a year before this
elopement of my husband that the disaster I mentioned above befell my
brother, who broke, and that in such bad circumstances, that I had the
mortification to hear, not only that he was in prison, but that there
would be little or nothing to be had by way of composition.

Misfortunes seldom come alone: this was the forerunner of my husband's
flight; and as my expectations were cut off on that side, my husband
gone, and my family of children on my hands, and nothing to subsist
them, my condition was the most deplorable that words can express.

I had some plate and some jewels, as might be supposed, my fortune and
former circumstances considered; and my husband, who had never stayed to
be distressed, had not been put to the necessity of rifling me, as
husbands usually do in such cases. But as I had seen an end of all the
ready money during the long time I had lived in a state of expectation
for my husband, so I began to make away one thing after another, till
those few things of value which I had began to lessen apace, and I saw
nothing but misery and the utmost distress before me, even to have my
children starve before my face. I leave any one that is a mother of
children, and has lived in plenty and in good fashion, to consider and
reflect what must be my condition. As to my husband, I had now no hope
or expectation of seeing him any more; and indeed, if I had, he was a
man of all the men in the world the least able to help me, or to have
turned his hand to the gaining one shilling towards lessening our
distress; he neither had the capacity or the inclination; he could have
been no clerk, for he scarce wrote a legible hand; he was so far from
being able to write sense, that he could not make sense of what others
wrote; he was so far from understanding good English, that he could not
spell good English; to be out of all business was his delight, and he
would stand leaning against a post for half-an-hour together, with a
pipe in his mouth, with all the tranquillity in the world, smoking, like
Dryden's countryman, that whistled as he went for want of thought, and
this even when his family was, as it were, starving, that little he had
wasting, and that we were all bleeding to death; he not knowing, and as
little considering, where to get another shilling when the last was
spent.

This being his temper, and the extent of his capacity, I confess I did
not see so much loss in his parting with me as at first I thought I did;
though it was hard and cruel to the last degree in him, not giving me
the least notice of his design; and indeed, that which I was most
astonished at was, that seeing he must certainly have intended this
excursion some few moments at least before he put it in practice, yet he
did not come and take what little stock of money we had left, or at
least a share of it, to bear his expense for a little while; but he did
not; and I am morally certain he had not five guineas with him in the
world when he went away. All that I could come to the knowledge of about
him was, that he left his hunting-horn, which he called the French horn,
in the stable, and his hunting-saddle, went away in a handsome
furniture, as they call it, which he used sometimes to travel with,
having an embroidered housing, a case of pistols, and other things
belonging to them; and one of his servants had another saddle with
pistols, though plain, and the other a long gun; so that they did not go
out as sportsmen, but rather as travellers; what part of the world they
went to I never heard for many years.

As I have said, I sent to his relations, but they sent me short and
surly answers; nor did any one of them offer to come to see me, or to
see the children, or so much as to inquire after them, well perceiving
that I was in a condition that was likely to be soon troublesome to
them. But it was no time now to dally with them or with the world; I
left off sending to them, and went myself among them, laid my
circumstances open to them, told them my whole case, and the condition I
was reduced to, begged they would advise me what course to take, laid
myself as low as they could desire, and entreated them to consider that
I was not in a condition to help myself, and that without some
assistance we must all inevitably perish. I told them that if I had had
but one child, or two children, I would have done my endeavour to have
worked for them with my needle, and should only have come to them to beg
them to help me to some work, that I might get our bread by my labour;
but to think of one single woman, not bred to work, and at a loss where
to get employment, to get the bread of five children, that was not
possible--some of my children being young too, and none of them big
enough to help one another.

It was all one; I received not one farthing of assistance from anybody,
was hardly asked to sit down at the two sisters' houses, nor offered to
eat or drink at two more near relations'. The fifth, an ancient
gentlewoman, aunt-in-law to my husband, a widow, and the least able also
of any of the rest, did, indeed, ask me to sit down, gave me a dinner,
and refreshed me with a kinder treatment than any of the rest, but added
the melancholy part, viz., that she would have helped me, but that,
indeed, she was not able, which, however, I was satisfied was very true.

Here I relieved myself with the constant assistant of the afflicted, I
mean tears; for, relating to her how I was received by the other of my
husband's relations, it made me burst into tears, and I cried vehemently
for a great while together, till I made the good old gentlewoman cry too
several times.

However, I came home from them all without any relief, and went on at
home till I was reduced to such inexpressible distress that is not to be
described. I had been several times after this at the old aunt's, for I
prevailed with her to promise me to go and talk with the other
relations, at least, that, if possible, she could bring some of them to
take off the children, or to contribute something towards their
maintenance. And, to do her justice, she did use her endeavour with
them; but all was to no purpose, they would do nothing, at least that
way. I think, with much entreaty, she obtained, by a kind of collection
among them all, about eleven or twelve shillings in money, which, though
it was a present comfort, was yet not to be named as capable to deliver
me from any part of the load that lay upon me.

There was a poor woman that had been a kind of a dependent upon our
family, and whom I had often, among the rest of the relations, been very
kind to; my maid put it into my head one morning to send to this poor
woman, and to see whether she might not be able to help in this dreadful
case.

I must remember it here, to the praise of this poor girl, my maid, that
though I was not able to give her any wages, and had told her so--nay, I
was not able to pay her the wages that I was in arrears to her--yet she
would not leave me; nay, and as long as she had any money, when I had
none, she would help me out of her own, for which, though I acknowledged
her kindness and fidelity, yet it was but a bad coin that she was paid
in at last, as will appear in its place.

Amy (for that was her name) put it into my thoughts to send for this
poor woman to come to me; for I was now in great distress, and I
resolved to do so. But just the very morning that I intended it, the old
aunt, with the poor woman in her company, came to see me; the good old
gentlewoman was, it seems, heartily concerned for me, and had been
talking again among those people, to see what she could do for me, but
to very little purpose.

You shall judge a little of my present distress by the posture she found
me in. I had five little children, the eldest was under ten years old,
and I had not one shilling in the house to buy them victuals, but had
sent Amy out with a silver spoon to sell it, and bring home something
from the butcher's; and I was in a parlour, sitting on the ground, with
a great heap of old rags, linen, and other things about me, looking them
over, to see if I had anything among them that would sell or pawn for a
little money, and had been crying ready to burst myself, to think what I
should do next.

At this juncture they knocked at the door. I thought it had been Amy,
so I did not rise up; but one of the children opened the door, and they
came directly into the room where I was, and where they found me in that
posture, and crying vehemently, as above. I was surprised at their
coming, you may be sure, especially seeing the person I had but just
before resolved to send for; but when they saw me, how I looked, for my
eyes were swelled with crying, and what a condition I was in as to the
house, and the heaps of things that were about me, and especially when I
told them what I was doing, and on what occasion, they sat down, like
Job's three comforters, and said not one word to me for a great while,
but both of them cried as fast and as heartily as I did.

The truth was, there was no need of much discourse in the case, the
thing spoke itself; they saw me in rags and dirt, who was but a little
before riding in my coach; thin, and looking almost like one starved,
who was before fat and beautiful. The house, that was before handsomely
furnished with pictures and ornaments, cabinets, pier-glasses, and
everything suitable, was now stripped and naked, most of the goods
having been seized by the landlord for rent, or sold to buy necessaries;
in a word, all was misery and distress, the face of ruin was everywhere
to be seen; we had eaten up almost everything, and little remained,
unless, like one of the pitiful women of Jerusalem, I should eat up my
very children themselves.

After these two good creatures had sat, as I say, in silence some time,
and had then looked about them, my maid Amy came in, and brought with
her a small breast of mutton and two great bunches of turnips, which she
intended to stew for our dinner. As for me, my heart was so overwhelmed
at seeing these two friends--for such they were, though poor--and at
their seeing me in such a condition, that I fell into another violent
fit of crying, so that, in short, I could not speak to them again for a
great while longer.

During my being in such an agony, they went to my maid Amy at another
part of the same room and talked with her. Amy told them all my
circumstances, and set them forth in such moving terms, and so to the
life, that I could not upon any terms have done it like her myself, and,
in a word, affected them both with it in such a manner, that the old
aunt came to me, and though hardly able to speak for tears, "Look ye,
cousin," said she, in a few words, "things must not stand thus; some
course must be taken, and that forthwith; pray, where were these
children born?" I told her the parish where we lived before, that four
of them were born there, and one in the house where I now was, where the
landlord, after having seized my goods for the rent past, not then
knowing my circumstances, had now given me leave to live for a whole
year more without any rent, being moved with compassion; but that this
year was now almost expired.

Upon hearing this account, they came to this resolution, that the
children should be all carried by them to the door of one of the
relations mentioned above, and be set down there by the maid Amy, and
that I, the mother, should remove for some days, shut up the doors, and
be gone; that the people should be told, that if they did not think fit
to take some care of the children, they might send for the churchwardens
if they thought that better, for that they were born in that parish, and
there they must be provided for; as for the other child, which was born
in the parish of ----, that was already taken care of by the parish
officers there, for indeed they were so sensible of the distress of the
family that they had at first word done what was their part to do.

This was what these good women proposed, and bade me leave the rest to
them. I was at first sadly afflicted at the thoughts of parting with my
children, and especially at that terrible thing, their being taken into
the parish keeping; and then a hundred terrible things came into my
thoughts, viz., of parish children being starved at nurse; of their
being ruined, let grow crooked, lamed, and the like, for want of being
taken care of; and this sunk my very heart within me.

But the misery of my own circumstances hardened my heart against my own
flesh and blood; and when I considered they must inevitably be starved,
and I too if I continued to keep them about me, I began to be reconciled
to parting with them all, anyhow and anywhere, that I might be freed
from the dreadful necessity of seeing them all perish, and perishing
with them myself. So I agreed to go away out of the house, and leave the
management of the whole matter to my maid Amy and to them; and
accordingly I did so, and the same afternoon they carried them all away
to one of their aunts.

Amy, a resolute girl, knocked at the door, with the children all with
her, and bade the eldest, as soon as the door was open, run in, and the
rest after her. She set them all down at the door before she knocked,
and when she knocked she stayed till a maid-servant came to the door;
"Sweetheart," said she, "pray go in and tell your mistress here are her
little cousins come to see her from ----," naming the town where we
lived, at which the maid offered to go back. "Here, child," says Amy,
"take one of 'em in your hand, and I'll bring the rest;" so she gives
her the least, and the wench goes in mighty innocently, with the little
one in her hand, upon which Amy turns the rest in after her, shuts the
door softly, and marches off as fast as she could.

Just in the interval of this, and even while the maid and her mistress
were quarrelling (for the mistress raved and scolded her like a mad
woman, and had ordered her to go and stop the maid Amy, and turn all the
children out of the doors again; but she had been at the door, and Amy
was gone, and the wench was out of her wits, and the mistress too), I
say, just at this juncture came the poor old woman, not the aunt, but
the other of the two that had been with me, and knocks at the door: the
aunt did not go, because she had pretended to advocate for me, and they
would have suspected her of some contrivance; but as for the other
woman, they did not so much as know that she had kept up any
correspondence with me.

Amy and she had concerted this between them, and it was well enough
contrived that they did so. When she came into the house, the mistress
was fuming, and raging like one distracted, and called the maid all the
foolish jades and sluts that she could think of, and that she would take
the children and turn them all out into the streets. The good poor
woman, seeing her in such a passion, turned about as if she would be
gone again, and said, "Madam, I'll come again another time, I see you
are engaged." "No, no, Mrs. ----," says the mistress, "I am not much
engaged, sit down; this senseless creature here has brought in my fool
of a brother's whole house of children upon me, and tells me that a
wench brought them to the door and thrust them in, and bade her carry
them to me; but it shall be no disturbance to me, for I have ordered
them to be set in the street without the door, and so let the
churchwardens take care of them, or else make this dull jade carry 'em
back to ---- again, and let her that brought them into the world look
after them if she will; what does she send her brats to me for?"

"The last indeed had been the best of the two," says the poor woman, "if
it had been to be done; and that brings me to tell you my errand, and
the occasion of my coming, for I came on purpose about this very
business, and to have prevented this being put upon you if I could, but
I see I am come too late."

"How do you mean too late?" says the mistress. "What! have you been
concerned in this affair, then? What! have you helped bring this family
slur upon us?" "I hope you do not think such a thing of me, madam," says
the poor woman; "but I went this morning to ----, to see my old mistress
and benefactor, for she had been very kind to me, and when I came to the
door I found all fast locked and bolted, and the house looking as if
nobody was at home.

"I knocked at the door, but nobody came, till at last some of the
neighbours' servants called to me and said, 'There's nobody lives there,
mistress; what do you knock for?' I seemed surprised at that. 'What,
nobody lives there!' said I; 'what d'ye mean? Does not Mrs. ---- live
there?' The answer was, 'No, she is gone;' at which I parleyed with one
of them, and asked her what was the matter. 'Matter!' says she, 'why, it
is matter enough: the poor gentlewoman has lived there all alone, and
without anything to subsist her a long time, and this morning the
landlord turned her out of doors.'

"'Out of doors!' says I; 'what! with all her children? Poor lambs, what
is become of them?' 'Why, truly, nothing worse,' said they, 'can come to
them than staying here, for they were almost starved with hunger; so the
neighbours, seeing the poor lady in such distress, for she stood crying
and wringing her hands over her children like one distracted, sent for
the churchwardens to take care of the children; and they, when they
came, took the youngest, which was born in this parish, and have got it
a very good nurse, and taken care of it; but as for the other four, they
had sent them away to some of their father's relations, and who were
very substantial people, and who, besides that, lived in the parish
where they were born.'

"I was not so surprised at this as not presently to foresee that this
trouble would be brought upon you or upon Mr. ----; so I came immediately
to bring word of it, that you might be prepared for it, and might not be
surprised; but I see they have been too nimble for me, so that I know
not what to advise. The poor woman, it seems, is turned out of doors
into the street; and another of the neighbours there told me, that when
they took her children from her she swooned away, and when they
recovered her out of that, she ran distracted, and is put into a
madhouse by the parish, for there is nobody else to take any care of
her."

This was all acted to the life by this good, kind, poor creature; for
though her design was perfectly good and charitable, yet there was not
one word of it true in fact; for I was not turned out of doors by the
landlord, nor gone distracted. It was true, indeed, that at parting with
my poor children I fainted, and was like one mad when I came to myself
and found they were gone; but I remained in the house a good while after
that, as you shall hear.

While the poor woman was telling this dismal story, in came the
gentlewoman's husband, and though her heart was hardened against all
pity, who was really and nearly related to the children, for they were
the children of her own brother, yet the good man was quite softened
with the dismal relation of the circumstances of the family; and when
the poor woman had done, he said to his wife, "This is a dismal case,
my dear, indeed, and something must be done." His wife fell a-raving at
him: "What," says she, "do you want to have four children to keep? Have
we not children of our own? Would you have these brats come and eat up
my children's bread? No, no, let 'em go to the parish, and let them take
care of them; I'll take care of my own."

"Come, come, my dear," says the husband, "charity is a duty to the poor,
and he that gives to the poor lends to the Lord; let us lend our
heavenly Father a little of our children's bread, as you call it; it
will be a store well laid up for them, and will be the best security
that our children shall never come to want charity, or be turned out of
doors, as these poor innocent creatures are." "Don't tell me of
security," says the wife, "'tis a good security for our children to keep
what we have together, and provide for them, and then 'tis time enough
to help keep other folks' children. Charity begins at home."

"Well, my dear," says he again, "I only talk of putting out a little
money to interest: our Maker is a good borrower; never fear making a bad
debt there, child, I'll be bound for it."

"Don't banter me with your charity and your allegories," says the wife
angrily; "I tell you they are my relations, not yours, and they shall
not roost here; they shall go to the parish."

"All your relations are my relations now," says the good gentleman very
calmly, "and I won't see your relations in distress, and not pity them,
any more than I would my own; indeed, my dear, they shan't go to the
parish. I assure you, none of my wife's relations shall come to the
parish, if I can help it."

"What! will you take four children to keep?" says the wife.

"No, no, my dear," says he, "there's your sister ----, I'll go and talk
with her; and your uncle ----, I'll send for him, and the rest. I'll
warrant you, when we are all together, we will find ways and means to
keep four poor little creatures from beggary and starving, or else it
would be very hard; we are none of us in so bad circumstances but we are
able to spare a mite for the fatherless. Don't shut up your bowels of
compassion against your own flesh and blood. Could you hear these poor
innocent children cry at your door for hunger, and give them no bread?"

"Prithee, what need they cry at our door?" says she. "'Tis the business
of the parish to provide for them; they shan't cry at our door. If they
do, I'll give them nothing." "Won't you?" says he; "but I will. Remember
that dreadful Scripture is directly against us, Prov. xxi. 13, 'Whoso
stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but
shall not be heard.'"

"Well, well," says she, "you must do what you will, because you pretend
to be master; but if I had my will I would send them where they ought to
be sent: I would send them from whence they came."

Then the poor woman put in, and said, "But, madam, that is sending them
to starve indeed, for the parish has no obligation to take care of 'em,
and so they will lie and perish in the street."

"Or be sent back again," says the husband, "to our parish in a
cripple-cart, by the justice's warrant, and so expose us and all the
relations to the last degree among our neighbours, and among those who
know the good old gentleman their grandfather, who lived and flourished
in this parish so many years, and was so well beloved among all people,
and deserved it so well."

"I don't value that one farthing, not I," says the wife; "I'll keep none
of them."

"Well, my dear," says her husband, "but I value it, for I won't have
such a blot lie upon the family, and upon your children; he was a
worthy, ancient, and good man, and his name is respected among all his
neighbours; it will be a reproach to you, that are his daughter, and to
our children, that are his grandchildren, that we should let your
brother's children perish, or come to be a charge to the public, in the
very place where your family once flourished. Come, say no more; I will
see what can be done."

Upon this he sends and gathers all the relations together at a tavern
hard by, and sent for the four little children, that they might see
them; and they all, at first word, agreed to have them taken care of,
and, because his wife was so furious that she would not suffer one of
them to be kept at home, they agreed to keep them all together for a
while; so they committed them to the poor woman that had managed the
affair for them, and entered into obligations to one another to supply
the needful sums for their maintenance; and, not to have one separated
from the rest, they sent for the youngest from the parish where it was
taken in, and had them all brought up together.

It would take up too long a part of this story to give a particular
account with what a charitable tenderness this good person, who was but
an uncle-in-law to them, managed that affair; how careful he was of
them; went constantly to see them, and to see that they were well
provided for, clothed, put to school, and, at last, put out in the world
for their advantage; but it is enough to say he acted more like a father
to them than an uncle-in-law, though all along much against his wife's
consent, who was of a disposition not so tender and compassionate as
her husband.

You may believe I heard this with the same pleasure which I now feel at
the relating it again; for I was terribly affrighted at the
apprehensions of my children being brought to misery and distress, as
those must be who have no friends, but are left to parish benevolence.

I was now, however, entering on a new scene of life. I had a great house
upon my hands, and some furniture left in it; but I was no more able to
maintain myself and my maid Amy in it than I was my five children; nor
had I anything to subsist with but what I might get by working, and that
was not a town where much work was to be had.

My landlord had been very kind indeed after he came to know my
circumstances; though, before he was acquainted with that part, he had
gone so far as to seize my goods, and to carry some of them off too.

But I had lived three-quarters of a year in his house after that, and
had paid him no rent, and, which was worse, I was in no condition to pay
him any. However, I observed he came oftener to see me, looked kinder
upon me, and spoke more friendly to me, than he used to do, particularly
the last two or three times he had been there. He observed, he said, how
poorly I lived, how low I was reduced, and the like; told me it grieved
him for my sake; and the last time of all he was kinder still, told me
he came to dine with me, and that I should give him leave to treat me;
so he called my maid Amy, and sent her out to buy a joint of meat; he
told her what she should buy; but naming two or three things, either of
which she might take, the maid, a cunning wench, and faithful to me as
the skin to my back, did not buy anything outright, but brought the
butcher along with her, with both the things that she had chosen, for
him to please himself. The one was a large, very good leg of veal; the
other a piece of the fore-ribs of roasting beef. He looked at them, but
made me chaffer with the butcher for him, and I did so, and came back to
him and told him what the butcher had demanded for either of them, and
what each of them came to. So he pulls out eleven shillings and
threepence, which they came to together, and bade me take them both; the
rest, he said, would serve another time.

I was surprised, you may be sure, at the bounty of a man that had but a
little while ago been my terror, and had torn the goods out of my house
like a fury; but I considered that my distresses had mollified his
temper, and that he had afterwards been so compassionate as to give me
leave to live rent free in the house a whole year.

But now he put on the face, not of a man of compassion only, but of a
man of friendship and kindness, and this was so unexpected that it was
surprising. We chatted together, and were, as I may call it, cheerful,
which was more than I could say I had been for three years before. He
sent for wine and beer too, for I had none; poor Amy and I had drank
nothing but water for many weeks, and indeed I have often wondered at
the faithful temper of the poor girl, for which I but ill requited her
at last.

When Amy was come with the wine, he made her fill a glass to him, and
with the glass in his hand he came to me and kissed me, which I was, I
confess, a little surprised at, but more at what followed; for he told
me, that as the sad condition which I was reduced to had made him pity
me, so my conduct in it, and the courage I bore it with, had given him a
more than ordinary respect for me, and made him very thoughtful for my
good; that he was resolved for the present to do something to relieve
me, and to employ his thoughts in the meantime, to see if he could for
the future put me into a way to support myself.

While he found me change colour, and look surprised at his discourse,
for so I did, to be sure, he turns to my maid Amy, and looking at her,
he says to me, "I say all this, madam, before your maid, because both
she and you shall know that I have no ill design, and that I have, in
mere kindness, resolved to do something for you if I can; and as I have
been a witness of the uncommon honesty and fidelity of Mrs. Amy here to
you in all your distresses, I know she may be trusted with so honest a
design as mine is; for I assure you, I bear a proportioned regard to
your maid too, for her affection to you."

Amy made him a curtsey, and the poor girl looked so confounded with joy
that she could not speak, but her colour came and went, and every now
and then she blushed as red as scarlet, and the next minute looked as
pale as death. Well, having said this, he sat down, made me sit down,
and then drank to me, and made me drink two glasses of wine together;
"For," says he, "you have need of it;" and so indeed I had. When he had
done so, "Come, Amy," says he, "with your mistress's leave, you shall
have a glass too." So he made her drink two glasses also; and then
rising up, "And now, Amy," says he, "go and get dinner; and you, madam,"
says he to me, "go up and dress you, and come down and smile and be
merry;" adding, "I'll make you easy if I can;" and in the meantime, he
said, he would walk in the garden.

When he was gone, Amy changed her countenance indeed, and looked as
merry as ever she did in her life. "Dear madam," says she, "what does
this gentleman mean?" "Nay, Amy," said I, "he means to do us good, you
see, don't he? I know no other meaning he can have, for he can get
nothing by me." "I warrant you, madam," says she, "he'll ask you a
favour by-and-by." "No, no, you are mistaken, Amy, I dare say," said I;
"you have heard what he said, didn't you?" "Ay," says Amy, "it's no
matter for that, you shall see what he will do after dinner." "Well,
well, Amy," says I, "you have hard thoughts of him. I cannot be of your
opinion: I don't see anything in him yet that looks like it." "As to
that, madam," says Amy, "I don't see anything of it yet neither; but
what should move a gentleman to take pity of us as he does?" "Nay," says
I, "that's a hard thing too, that we should judge a man to be wicked
because he's charitable, and vicious because he's kind." "Oh, madam,"
says Amy, "there's abundance of charity begins in that vice; and he is
not so unacquainted with things as not to know that poverty is the
strongest incentive--a temptation against which no virtue is powerful
enough to stand out. He knows your condition as well as you do." "Well,
and what then?" "Why, then, he knows too that you are young and
handsome, and he has the surest bait in the world to take you with."

"Well, Amy," said I, "but he may find himself mistaken too in such a
thing as that." "Why, madam," says Amy, "I hope you won't deny him if he
should offer it."

"What d'ye mean by that, hussy?" said I. "No, I'd starve first."

"I hope not, madam, I hope you would be wiser; I'm sure if he will set
you up, as he talks of, you ought to deny him nothing; and you will
starve if you do not consent, that's certain."

"What! consent to lie with him for bread? Amy," said I, "how can you
talk so!"

"Nay, madam," says Amy, "I don't think you would for anything else; it
would not be lawful for anything else, but for bread, madam; why, nobody
can starve, there's no bearing that, I'm sure."

"Ay," says I, "but if he would give me an estate to live on, he should
not lie with me, I assure you."

"Why, look you, madam; if he would but give you enough to live easy
upon, he should lie with me for it with all my heart."

"That's a token, Amy, of inimitable kindness to me," said I, "and I know
how to value it; but there's more friendship than honesty in it, Amy."

"Oh, madam," says Amy, "I'd do anything to get you out of this sad
condition; as to honesty, I think honesty is out of the question when
starving is the case. Are not we almost starved to death?"

"I am indeed," said I, "and thou art for my sake; but to be a whore,
Amy!" and there I stopped.

"Dear madam," says Amy, "if I will starve for your sake, I will be a
whore or anything for your sake; why, I would die for you if I were put
to it."

"Why, that's an excess of affection, Amy," said I, "I never met with
before; I wish I may be ever in condition to make you some returns
suitable. But, however, Amy, you shall not be a whore to him, to oblige
him to be kind to me; no, Amy, nor I won't be a whore to him, if he
would give me much more than he is able to give me or do for me."

"Why, madam," says Amy, "I don't say I will go and ask him; but I say,
if he should promise to do so and so for you, and the condition was such
that he would not serve you unless I would let him lie with me, he
should lie with me as often as he would, rather than you should not have
his assistance. But this is but talk, madam; I don't see any need of
such discourse, and you are of opinion that there will be no need of
it."

"Indeed so I am, Amy; but," said I, "if there was, I tell you again, I'd
die before I would consent, or before you should consent for my sake."

Hitherto I had not only preserved the virtue itself, but the virtuous
inclination and resolution; and had I kept myself there I had been
happy, though I had perished of mere hunger; for, without question, a
woman ought rather to die than to prostitute her virtue and honour, let
the temptation be what it will.

But to return to my story; he walked about the garden, which was,
indeed, all in disorder, and overrun with weeds, because I had not been
able to hire a gardener to do anything to it, no, not so much as to dig
up ground enough to sow a few turnips and carrots for family use. After
he had viewed it, he came in, and sent Amy to fetch a poor man, a
gardener, that used to help our man-servant, and carried him into the
garden, and ordered him to do several things in it, to put it into a
little order; and this took him up near an hour.

By this time I had dressed me as well as I could; for though I had good
linen left still, yet I had but a poor head-dress, and no knots, but old
fragments; no necklace, no earrings; all those things were gone long ago
for mere bread.

However, I was tight and clean, and in better plight than he had seen me
in a great while, and he looked extremely pleased to see me so; for, he
said, I looked so disconsolate and so afflicted before, that it grieved
him to see me; and he bade me pluck up a good heart, for he hoped to put
me in a condition to live in the world, and be beholden to nobody.

I told him that was impossible, for I must be beholden to him for it,
for all the friends I had in the world would not or could not do so much
for me as that he spoke of "Well, widow," says he (so he called me, and
so indeed I was in the worst sense that desolate word could be used
in), "if you are beholden to me, you shall be beholden to nobody else."

By this time dinner was ready, and Amy came in to lay the cloth, and
indeed it was happy there was none to dine but he and I, for I had but
six plates left in the house, and but two dishes; however, he knew how
things were, and bade me make no scruple about bringing out what I had.
He hoped to see me in a better plight. He did not come, he said, to be
entertained, but to entertain me, and comfort and encourage me. Thus he
went on, speaking so cheerfully to me, and such cheerful things, that it
was a cordial to my very soul to hear him speak.

Well, we went to dinner. I'm sure I had not ate a good meal hardly in a
twelvemonth, at least not of such a joint of meat as the loin of veal
was. I ate, indeed, very heartily, and so did he, and he made me drink
three or four glasses of wine; so that, in short, my spirits were lifted
up to a degree I had not been used to, and I was not only cheerful, but
merry; and so he pressed me to be.

I told him I had a great deal of reason to be merry, seeing he had been
so kind to me, and had given me hopes of recovering me from the worst
circumstances that ever woman of any sort of fortune was sunk into; that
he could not but believe that what he had said to me was like life from
the dead; that it was like recovering one sick from the brink of the
grave; how I should ever make him a return any way suitable was what I
had not yet had time to think of; I could only say that I should never
forget it while I had life, and should be always ready to acknowledge
it.

He said that was all he desired of me; that his reward would be the
satisfaction of having rescued me from misery; that he found he was
obliging one that knew what gratitude meant; that he would make it his
business to make me completely easy, first or last, if it lay in his
power; and in the meantime he bade me consider of anything that I
thought he might do for me, for my advantage, and in order to make me
perfectly easy.

After we had talked thus, he bade me be cheerful. "Come," says he, "lay
aside these melancholy things, and let us be merry." Amy waited at the
table, and she smiled and laughed, and was so merry she could hardly
contain it, for the girl loved me to an excess hardly to be described;
and it was such an unexpected thing to hear any one talk to her
mistress, that the wench was beside herself almost, and, as soon as
dinner was over, Amy went upstairs, and put on her best clothes too, and
came down dressed like a gentlewoman.

We sat together talking of a thousand things--of what had been, and what
was to be--all the rest of the day, and in the evening he took his
leave of me, with a thousand expressions of kindness and tenderness and
true affection to me, but offered not the least of what my maid Amy had
suggested.

At his going away he took me in his arms, protested an honest kindness
to me; said a thousand kind things to me, which I cannot now recollect;
and, after kissing me twenty times or thereabouts, put a guinea into my
hand, which, he said, was for my present supply, and told me that he
would see me again before it was out; also he gave Amy half-a-crown.

When he was gone, "Well, Amy," said I, "are you convinced now that he is
an honest as well as a true friend, and that there has been nothing, not
the least appearance of anything, of what you imagined in his
behaviour?" "Yes," says Amy, "I am, but I admire at it. He is such a
friend as the world, sure, has not abundance of to show."

"I am sure," says I, "he is such a friend as I have long wanted, and as
I have as much need of as any creature in the world has or ever had."
And, in short, I was so overcome with the comfort of it that I sat down
and cried for joy a good while, as I had formerly cried for sorrow. Amy
and I went to bed that night (for Amy lay with me) pretty early, but lay
chatting almost all night about it, and the girl was so transported that
she got up two or three times in the night and danced about the room in
her shift; in short, the girl was half distracted with the joy of it; a
testimony still of her violent affection for her mistress, in which no
servant ever went beyond her.

We heard no more of him for two days, but the third day he came again;
then he told me, with the same kindness, that he had ordered me a supply
of household goods for the furnishing the house; that, in particular, he
had sent me back all the goods that he had seized for rent, which
consisted, indeed, of the best of my former furniture. "And now," says
he, "I'll tell you what I have had in my head for you for your present
supply, and that is," says he, "that the house being well furnished, you
shall let it out to lodgings for the summer gentry," says he, "by which
you will easily get a good comfortable subsistence, especially seeing
you shall pay me no rent for two years, nor after neither, unless you
can afford it."

This was the first view I had of living comfortably indeed, and it was a
very probable way, I must confess, seeing we had very good conveniences,
six rooms on a floor, and three stories high. While he was laying down
the scheme of my management, came a cart to the door with a load of
goods, and an upholsterer's man to put them up. They were chiefly the
furniture of two rooms which he had carried away for his two years'
rent, with two fine cabinets, and some pier-glasses out of the parlour,
and several other valuable things.

These were all restored to their places, and he told me he gave them me
freely, as a satisfaction for the cruelty he had used me with before;
and the furniture of one room being finished and set up, he told me he
would furnish one chamber for himself, and would come and be one of my
lodgers, if I would give him leave.

I told him he ought not to ask me leave, who had so much right to make
himself welcome. So the house began to look in some tolerable figure,
and clean; the garden also, in about a fortnight's work, began to look
something less like a wilderness than it used to do; and he ordered me
to put up a bill for letting rooms, reserving one for himself, to come
to as he saw occasion.

When all was done to his mind, as to placing the goods, he seemed very
well pleased, and we dined together again of his own providing; and the
upholsterer's man gone, after dinner he took me by the hand. "Come now,
madam," says he, "you must show me your house" (for he had a mind to see
everything over again). "No, sir," said I; "but I'll go show you your
house, if you please;" so we went up through all the rooms, and in the
room which was appointed for himself Amy was doing something. "Well,
Amy," says he, "I intend to lie with you to-morrow night." "To-night if
you please, sir," says Amy very innocently; "your room is quite ready."
"Well, Amy," says he, "I am glad you are so willing." "No," says Amy, "I
mean your chamber is ready to-night," and away she run out of the room,
ashamed enough; for the girl meant no harm, whatever she had said to me
in private.

However, he said no more then; but when Amy was gone he walked about the
room, and looked at everything, and taking me by the hand he kissed me,
and spoke a great many kind, affectionate things to me indeed; as of his
measures for my advantage, and what he would do to raise me again in the
world; told me that my afflictions and the conduct I had shown in
bearing them to such an extremity, had so engaged him to me that he
valued me infinitely above all the women in the world; that though he
was under such engagements that he could not marry me (his wife and he
had been parted for some reasons, which make too long a story to
intermix with mine), yet that he would be everything else that a woman
could ask in a husband; and with that he kissed me again, and took me in
his arms, but offered not the least uncivil action to me, and told me he
hoped I would not deny him all the favours he should ask, because he
resolved to ask nothing of me but what it was fit for a woman of virtue
and modesty, for such he knew me to be, to yield.

I confess the terrible pressure of my former misery, the memory of which
lay heavy upon my mind, and the surprising kindness with which he had
delivered me, and, withal, the expectations of what he might still do
for me, were powerful things, and made me have scarce the power to deny
him anything he would ask. However, I told him thus, with an air of
tenderness too, that he had done so much for me that I thought I ought
to deny him nothing; only I hoped and depended upon him that he would
not take the advantage of the infinite obligations I was under to him,
to desire anything of me the yielding to which would lay me lower in his
esteem than I desired to be; that as I took him to be a man of honour,
so I knew he could not like me better for doing anything that was below
a woman of honesty and good manners to do.

He told me that he had done all this for me, without so much as telling
me what kindness or real affection he had for me, that I might not be
under any necessity of yielding to him in anything for want of bread;
and he would no more oppress my gratitude now than he would my necessity
before, nor ask anything, supposing he would stop his favours or
withdraw his kindness, if he was denied; it was true, he said, he might
tell me more freely his mind now than before, seeing I had let him see
that I accepted his assistance, and saw that he was sincere in his
design of serving me; that he had gone thus far to show me that he was
kind to me, but that now he would tell me that he loved me, and yet
would demonstrate that his love was both honourable, and that what he
should desire was what he might honestly ask and I might honestly grant.

I answered that, within those two limitations, I was sure I ought to
deny him nothing, and I should think myself not ungrateful only, but
very unjust, if I should; so he said no more, but I observed he kissed
me more, and took me in his arms in a kind of familiar way, more than
usual, and which once or twice put me in mind of my maid Amy's words;
and yet, I must acknowledge, I was so overcome with his goodness to me
in those many kind things he had done that I not only was easy at what
he did and made no resistance, but was inclined to do the like, whatever
he had offered to do. But he went no farther than what I have said, nor
did he offer so much as to sit down on the bedside with me, but took his
leave, said he loved me tenderly, and would convince me of it by such
demonstrations as should be to my satisfaction. I told him I had a great
deal of reason to believe him, that he was full master of the whole
house and of me, as far as was within the bounds we had spoken of, which
I believe he would not break, and asked him if he would not lodge there
that night.

He said he could not well stay that night, business requiring him in
London, but added, smiling, that he would come the next day and take a
night's lodging with me. I pressed him to stay that night, and told him
I should be glad a friend so valuable should be under the same roof with
me; and indeed I began at that time not only to be much obliged to him,
but to love him too, and that in a manner that I had not been acquainted
with myself.

Oh! let no woman slight the temptation that being generously delivered
from trouble is to any spirit furnished with gratitude and just
principles. This gentleman had freely and voluntarily delivered me from
misery, from poverty, and rags; he had made me what I was, and put me
into a way to be even more than I ever was, namely, to live happy and
pleased, and on his bounty I depended. What could I say to this
gentleman when he pressed me to yield to him, and argued the lawfulness
of it? But of that in its place.

I pressed him again to stay that night, and told him it was the first
completely happy night that I had ever had in the house in my life, and
I should be very sorry to have it be without his company, who was the
cause and foundation of it all; that we would be innocently merry, but
that it could never be without him; and, in short, I courted him so,
that he said he could not deny me, but he would take his horse and go
to London, do the business he had to do, which, it seems, was to pay a
foreign bill that was due that night, and would else be protested, and
that he would come back in three hours at farthest, and sup with me; but
bade me get nothing there, for since I was resolved to be merry, which
was what he desired above all things, he would send me something from
London. "And we will make it a wedding supper, my dear," says he; and
with that word took me in his arms, and kissed me so vehemently that I
made no question but he intended to do everything else that Amy had
talked of.

I started a little at the word wedding. "What do ye mean, to call it by
such a name?" says I; adding, "We will have a supper, but t'other is
impossible, as well on your side as mine." He laughed. "Well," says he,
"you shall call it what you will, but it may be the same thing, for I
shall satisfy you it is not so impossible as you make it."

"I don't understand you," said I. "Have not I a husband and you a wife?"

"Well, well," says he, "we will talk of that after supper;" so he rose
up, gave me another kiss, and took his horse for London.

This kind of discourse had fired my blood, I confess, and I knew not
what to think of it. It was plain now that he intended to lie with me,
but how he would reconcile it to a legal thing, like a marriage, that I
could not imagine. We had both of us used Amy with so much intimacy, and
trusted her with everything, having such unexampled instances of her
fidelity, that he made no scruple to kiss me and say all these things to
me before her; nor had he cared one farthing, if I would have let him
lie with me, to have had Amy there too all night. When he was gone,
"Well, Amy," says I, "what will all this come to now? I am all in a
sweat at him." "Come to, madam?" says Amy. "I see what it will come to;
I must put you to bed to-night together." "Why, you would not be so
impudent, you jade you," says I, "would you?" "Yes, I would," says she,
"with all my heart, and think you both as honest as ever you were in
your lives."

"What ails the slut to talk so?" said I. "Honest! How can it be honest?"
"Why, I'll tell you, madam," says Amy; "I sounded it as soon as I heard
him speak, and it is very true too; he calls you widow, and such indeed
you are; for, as my master has left you so many years, he is dead, to be
sure; at least he is dead to you; he is no husband. You are, and ought
to be, free to marry who you will; and his wife being gone from him, and
refusing to lie with him, then he is a single man again as much as ever;
and though you cannot bring the laws of the land to join you together,
yet, one refusing to do the office of a wife, and the other of a
husband, you may certainly take one another fairly."

"Nay, Amy," says I, "if I could take him fairly, you may be sure I'd
take him above all the men in the world; it turned the very heart within
me when I heard him say he loved me. How could it be otherwise, when you
know what a condition I was in before, despised and trampled on by all
the world? I could have took him in my arms and kissed him as freely as
he did me, if it had not been for shame."

"Ay, and all the rest too," says Amy, "at the first word. I don't see
how you can think of denying him anything. Has he not brought you out of
the devil's clutches, brought you out of the blackest misery that ever
poor lady was reduced to? Can a woman deny such a man anything?"

"Nay, I don't know what to do, Amy," says I. "I hope he won't desire
anything of that kind of me; I hope he won't attempt it. If he does, I
know not what to say to him."

"Not ask you!" says Amy. "Depend upon it, he will ask you, and you will
grant it too. I am sure my mistress is no fool. Come, pray, madam, let
me go air you a clean shift; don't let him find you in foul linen the
wedding-night."

"But that I know you to be a very honest girl, Amy," says I, "you would
make me abhor you. Why, you argue for the devil, as if you were one of
his privy councillors."

"It's no matter for that, madam, I say nothing but what I think. You own
you love this gentleman, and he has given you sufficient testimony of
his affection to you; your conditions are alike unhappy, and he is of
opinion that he may take another woman, his first wife having broke her
honour, and living from him; and that though the laws of the land will
not allow him to marry formally, yet that he may take another woman into
his arms, provided he keeps true to the other woman as a wife; nay, he
says it is usual to do so, and allowed by the custom of the place, in
several countries abroad. And, I must own, I am of the same mind; else
it is in the power of a whore, after she has jilted and abandoned her
husband, to confine him from the pleasure as well as convenience of a
woman all the days of his life, which would be very unreasonable, and,
as times go, not tolerable to all people; and the like on your side,
madam."

Had I now had my senses about me, and had my reason not been overcome by
the powerful attraction of so kind, so beneficent a friend; had I
consulted conscience and virtue, I should have repelled this Amy,
however faithful and honest to me in other things, as a viper and engine
of the devil. I ought to have remembered that neither he or I, either
by the laws of God or man, could come together upon any other terms
than that of notorious adultery. The ignorant jade's argument, that he
had brought me out of the hands of the devil, by which she meant the
devil of poverty and distress, should have been a powerful motive to me
not to plunge myself into the jaws of hell, and into the power of the
real devil, in recompense for that deliverance. I should have looked
upon all the good this man had done for me to have been the particular
work of the goodness of Heaven, and that goodness should have moved me
to a return of duty and humble obedience. I should have received the
mercy thankfully, and applied it soberly, to the praise and honour of my
Maker; whereas, by this wicked course, all the bounty and kindness of
this gentleman became a snare to me, was a mere bait to the devil's
hook; I received his kindness at the dear expense of body and soul,
mortgaging faith, religion, conscience, and modesty for (as I may call
it) a morsel of bread; or, if you will, ruined my soul from a principle
of gratitude, and gave myself up to the devil, to show myself grateful
to my benefactor. I must do the gentleman that justice as to say I
verily believe that he did nothing but what he thought was lawful; and I
must do that justice upon myself as to say I did what my own conscience
convinced me, at the very time I did it, was horribly unlawful,
scandalous, and abominable.

But poverty was my snare; dreadful poverty! The misery I had been in was
great, such as would make the heart tremble at the apprehensions of its
return; and I might appeal to any that has had any experience of the
world, whether one so entirely destitute as I was of all manner of all
helps or friends, either to support me or to assist me to support
myself, could withstand the proposal; not that I plead this as a
justification of my conduct, but that it may move the pity even of those
that abhor the crime.

Besides this, I was young, handsome, and, with all the mortifications I
had met with, was vain, and that not a little; and, as it was a new
thing, so it was a pleasant thing to be courted, caressed, embraced, and
high professions of affection made to me, by a man so agreeable and so
able to do me good.

Add to this, that if I had ventured to disoblige this gentleman, I had
no friend in the world to have recourse to; I had no prospect--no, not
of a bit of bread; I had nothing before me but to fall back into the
same misery that I had been in before.

Amy had but too much rhetoric in this cause; she represented all those
things in their proper colours; she argued them all with her utmost
skill; and at last the merry jade, when she came to dress me, "Look ye,
madam," said she, "if you won't consent, tell him you will do as Rachel
did to Jacob, when she could have no children--put her maid to bed to
him; tell him you cannot comply with him, but there's Amy, he may ask
her the question; she has promised me she won't deny you."

"And would you have me say so, Amy?" said I.

"No, madam; but I would really have you do so. Besides, you are undone
if you do not; and if my doing it would save you from being undone, as I
said before, he shall, if he will; if he asks me, I won't deny him, not
I; hang me if I do," says Amy.

"Well, I know not what to do," says I to Amy.

"Do!" says Amy. "Your choice is fair and plain. Here you may have a
handsome, charming gentleman, be rich, live pleasantly and in plenty, or
refuse him, and want a dinner, go in rags, live in tears; in short, beg
and starve. You know this is the case, madam," says Amy. "I wonder how
you can say you know not what to do."

"Well, Amy," says I, "the case is as you say, and I think verily I must
yield to him; but then," said I, moved by conscience, "don't talk any
more of your cant of its being lawful that I ought to marry again, and
that he ought to marry again, and such stuff as that; 'tis all
nonsense," says I, "Amy, there's nothing in it; let me hear no more of
that, for if I yield, 'tis in vain to mince the matter, I am a whore,
Amy; neither better nor worse, I assure you."

"I don't think so, madam, by no means," says Amy. "I wonder how you can
talk so;" and then she run on with her argument of the unreasonableness
that a woman should be obliged to live single, or a man to live single,
in such cases as before. "Well, Amy," said I, "come, let us dispute no
more, for the longer I enter into that part, the greater my scruples
will be; but if I let it alone, the necessity of my present
circumstances is such that I believe I shall yield to him, if he should
importune me much about it; but I should be glad he would not do it at
all, but leave me as I am."

"As to that, madam, you may depend," says Amy, "he expects to have you
for his bedfellow to-night. I saw it plainly in his management all day;
and at last he told you so too, as plain, I think, as he could." "Well,
well, Amy," said I, "I don't know what to say; if he will he must, I
think; I don't know how to resist such a man, that has done so much for
me." "I don't know how you should," says Amy.

Thus Amy and I canvassed the business between us; the jade prompted the
crime which I had but too much inclination to commit, that is to say,
not as a crime, for I had nothing of the vice in my constitution; my
spirits were far from being high, my blood had no fire in it to kindle
the flame of desire; but the kindness and good humour of the man and
the dread of my own circumstances concurred to bring me to the point,
and I even resolved, before he asked, to give up my virtue to him
whenever he should put it to the question.

In this I was a double offender, whatever he was, for I was resolved to
commit the crime, knowing and owning it to be a crime; he, if it was
true as he said, was fully persuaded it was lawful, and in that
persuasion he took the measures and used all the circumlocutions which I
am going to speak of.

About two hours after he was gone, came a Leadenhall basket-woman, with
a whole load of good things for the mouth (the particulars are not to
the purpose), and brought orders to get supper by eight o'clock.
However, I did not intend to begin to dress anything till I saw him; and
he gave me time enough, for he came before seven, so that Amy, who had
gotten one to help her, got everything ready in time.

We sat down to supper about eight, and were indeed very merry. Amy made
us some sport, for she was a girl of spirit and wit, and with her talk
she made us laugh very often, and yet the jade managed her wit with all
the good manners imaginable.

But to shorten the story. After supper he took me up into his chamber,
where Amy had made a good fire, and there he pulled out a great many
papers, and spread them upon a little table, and then took me by the
hand, and after kissing me very much, he entered into a discourse of his
circumstances and of mine, how they agreed in several things exactly;
for example, that I was abandoned of a husband in the prime of my youth
and vigour, and he of a wife in his middle age; how the end of marriage
was destroyed by the treatment we had either of us received, and it
would be very hard that we should be tied by the formality of the
contract where the essence of it was destroyed. I interrupted him, and
told him there was a vast difference between our circumstances, and that
in the most essential part, namely, that he was rich, and I was poor;
that he was above the world, and I infinitely below it; that his
circumstances were very easy, mine miserable, and this was an inequality
the most essential that could be imagined. "As to that, my dear," says
he, "I have taken such measures as shall make an equality still;" and
with that he showed me a contract in writing, wherein he engaged himself
to me to cohabit constantly with me, to provide for me in all respects
as a wife, and repeating in the preamble a long account of the nature
and reason of our living together, and an obligation in the penalty of
£7000 never to abandon me; and at last showed me a bond for £500, to be
paid to me, or to my assigns, within three months after his death.

He read over all these things to me, and then, in a most moving,
affectionate manner, and in words not to be answered, he said, "Now, my
dear, is this not sufficient? Can you object anything against it? If
not, as I believe you will not, then let us debate this matter no
longer." With that he pulled out a silk purse, which had threescore
guineas in it, and threw them into my lap, and concluded all the rest of
his discourse with kisses and protestations of his love, of which indeed
I had abundant proof.

Pity human frailty, you that read of a woman reduced in her youth and
prime to the utmost misery and distress, and raised again, as above, by
the unexpected and surprising bounty of a stranger; I say, pity her if
she was not able, after all these things, to make any more resistance.

However, I stood out a little longer still. I asked him how he could
expect that I could come into a proposal of such consequence the very
first time it was moved to me; and that I ought, if I consented to it,
to capitulate with him that he should never upbraid me with easiness and
consenting too soon. He said no; but, on the contrary, he would take it
as a mark of the greatest kindness I could show him. Then he went on to
give reasons why there was no occasion to use the ordinary ceremony of
delay, or to wait a reasonable time of courtship, which was only to
avoid scandal; but, as this was private, it had nothing of that nature
in it; that he had been courting me some time by the best of courtship,
viz., doing acts of kindness to me; and that he had given testimonies of
his sincere affection to me by deeds, not by flattering trifles and the
usual courtship of words, which were often found to have very little
meaning; that he took me, not as a mistress, but as his wife, and
protested it was clear to him he might lawfully do it, and that I was
perfectly at liberty, and assured me, by all that it was possible for an
honest man to say, that he would treat me as his wife as long as he
lived. In a word, he conquered all the little resistance I intended to
make; he protested he loved me above all the world, and begged I would
for once believe him; that he had never deceived me, and never would,
but would make it his study to make my life comfortable and happy, and
to make me forget the misery I had gone through. I stood still a while,
and said nothing; but seeing him eager for my answer, I smiled, and
looking up at him, "And must I, then," says I, "say yes at first asking?
Must I depend upon your promise? Why, then," said I, "upon the faith of
that promise, and in the sense of that inexpressible kindness you have
shown me, you shall be obliged, and I will be wholly yours to the end of
my life;" and with that I took his hand, which held me by the hand, and
gave it a kiss.

And thus, in gratitude for the favours I received from a man, was all
sense of religion and duty to God, all regard to virtue and honour,
given up at once, and we were to call one another man and wife, who, in
the sense of the laws both of God and our country, were no more than two
adulterers; in short, a whore and a rogue. Nor, as I have said above,
was my conscience silent in it, though it seems his was; for I sinned
with open eyes, and thereby had a double guilt upon me. As I always
said, his notions were of another kind, and he either was before of the
opinion, or argued himself into it now, that we were both free and might
lawfully marry.

But I was quite of another side--nay, and my judgment was right, but my
circumstances were my temptation; the terrors behind me looked blacker
than the terrors before me; and the dreadful argument of wanting bread,
and being run into the horrible distresses I was in before, mastered all
my resolution, and I gave myself up as above.

The rest of the evening we spent very agreeably to me; he was perfectly
good-humoured, and was at that time very merry. Then he made Amy dance
with him, and I told him I would put Amy to bed to him. Amy said, with
all her heart; she never had been a bride in her life. In short, he made
the girl so merry that, had he not been to lie with me the same night,
I believe he would have played the fool with Amy for half-an-hour, and
the girl would no more have refused him than I intended to do. Yet
before, I had always found her a very modest wench as any I ever saw in
all my life; but, in short, the mirth of that night, and a few more such
afterwards, ruined the girl's modesty for ever, as shall appear
by-and-by, in its place.

So far does fooling and toying sometimes go that I know nothing a young
woman has to be more cautious of; so far had this innocent girl gone in
jesting between her and I, and in talking that she would let him lie
with her, if he would but be kinder to me, that at last she let him lie
with her in earnest; and so empty was I now of all principle, that I
encouraged the doing it almost before my face.

I say but too justly that I was empty of principle, because, as above, I
had yielded to him, not as deluded to believe it lawful, but as overcome
by his kindness, and terrified at the fear of my own misery if he should
leave me. So with my eyes open, and with my conscience, as I may say,
awake, I sinned, knowing it to be a sin, but having no power to resist.
When this had thus made a hole in my heart, and I was come to such a
height as to transgress against the light of my own conscience, I was
then fit for any wickedness, and conscience left off speaking where it
found it could not be heard.

But to return to our story. Having consented, as above, to his proposal,
we had not much more to do. He gave me my writings, and the bond for my
maintenance during his life, and for five hundred pounds after his
death. And so far was he from abating his affection to me afterwards,
that two years after we were thus, as he called it, married, he made his
will, and gave me a thousand pounds more, and all my household stuff,
plate, &c., which was considerable too.

Amy put us to bed, and my new friend--I cannot call him husband--was so
well pleased with Amy for her fidelity and kindness to me that he paid
her all the arrear of her wages that I owed her, and gave her five
guineas over; and had it gone no farther, Amy had richly deserved what
she had, for never was a maid so true to her mistress in such dreadful
circumstances as I was in. Nor was what followed more her own fault than
mine, who led her almost into it at first, and quite into it at last;
and this may be a farther testimony what a hardness of crime I was now
arrived to, which was owing to the conviction, that was from the
beginning upon me, that I was a whore, not a wife; nor could I ever
frame my mouth to call him husband or to say "my husband" when I was
speaking of him.

We lived, surely, the most agreeable life, the grand exception only
excepted, that ever two lived together. He was the most obliging,
gentlemanly man, and the most tender of me, that ever woman gave herself
up to. Nor was there ever the least interruption to our mutual kindness,
no, not to the last day of his life. But I must bring Amy's disaster in
at once, that I may have done with her.

Amy was dressing me one morning, for now I had two maids, and Amy was my
chambermaid. "Dear madam," says Amy, "what! a'nt you with child yet?"
"No, Amy," says I; "nor any sign of it."

"Law, madam!" says Amy, "what have you been doing? Why, you have been
married a year and a half. I warrant you master would have got me with
child twice in that time." "It may be so, Amy," says I. "Let him try,
can't you?" "No," says Amy; "you'll forbid it now. Before, I told you he
should, with all my heart; but I won't now, now he's all your own."
"Oh," says I, "Amy, I'll freely give you my consent. It will be nothing
at all to me. Nay, I'll put you to bed to him myself one night or other,
if you are willing." "No, madam, no," says Amy, "not now he's yours."

"Why, you fool you," says I, "don't I tell you I'll put you to bed to
him myself?" "Nay, nay," says Amy, "if you put me to bed to him, that's
another case; I believe I shall not rise again very soon." "I'll venture
that, Amy," says I.

After supper that night, and before we were risen from table, I said to
him, Amy being by, "Hark ye, Mr. ----, do you know that you are to lie
with Amy to-night?" "No, not I," says he; but turns to Amy, "Is it so,
Amy?" says he. "No, sir," says she. "Nay, don't say no, you fool; did
not I promise to put you to bed to him?" But the girl said "No," still,
and it passed off.

At night, when we came to go to bed, Amy came into the chamber to
undress me, and her master slipped into bed first; then I began, and
told him all that Amy had said about my not being with child, and of her
being with child twice in that time. "Ay, Mrs. Amy," says he, "I believe
so too. Come hither, and, we'll try." But Amy did not go. "Go, you
fool," says I, "can't you? I freely give you both leave." But Amy would
not go. "Nay, you whore," says I, "you said, if I would put you to bed,
you would with all your heart." And with that I sat her down, pulled off
her stockings and shoes, and all her clothes piece by piece, and led her
to the bed to him. "Here," says I, "try what you can do with your maid
Amy." She pulled back a little, would not let me pull off her clothes at
first, but it was hot weather, and she had not many clothes on, and
particularly no stays on; and at last, when she saw I was in earnest,
she let me do what I would. So I fairly stripped her, and then I threw
open the bed and thrust her in.

I need say no more. This is enough to convince anybody that I did not
think him my husband, and that I had cast off all principle and all
modesty, and had effectually stifled conscience.

Amy, I dare say, began now to repent, and would fain have got out of bed
again; but he said to her, "Nay, Amy, you see your mistress has put you
to bed; 'tis all her doing; you must blame her." So he held her fast,
and the wench being naked in the bed with him, it was too late to look
back, so she lay still and let him do what he would with her.

Had I looked upon myself as a wife, you cannot suppose I would have been
willing to have let my husband lie with my maid, much less before my
face, for I stood by all the while; but as I thought myself a whore, I
cannot say but that it was something designed in my thoughts that my
maid should be a whore too, and should not reproach me with it.

Amy, however, less vicious than I, was grievously out of sorts the next
morning, and cried and took on most vehemently, that she was ruined and
undone, and there was no pacifying her; she was a whore, a slut, and she
was undone! undone! and cried almost all day. I did all I could to
pacify her. "A whore!" says I. "Well, and am not I a whore as well as
you?" "No, no," says Amy; "no, you are not, for you are married." "Not
I, Amy," says I; "I do not pretend to it. He may marry you to-morrow,
if he will, for anything I could do to hinder it. I am not married. I do
not look upon it as anything." Well, all did not pacify Amy, but she
cried two or three days about it; but it wore off by degrees.

But the case differed between Amy and her master exceedingly; for Amy
retained the same kind temper she always had; but, on the contrary, he
was quite altered, for he hated her heartily, and could, I believe, have
killed her after it, and he told me so, for he thought this a vile
action; whereas what he and I had done he was perfectly easy in, thought
it just, and esteemed me as much his wife as if we had been married from
our youth, and had neither of us known any other; nay, he loved me, I
believe, as entirely as if I had been the wife of his youth. Nay, he
told me it was true, in one sense, that he had two wives, but that I was
the wife of his affection, the other the wife of his aversion.

I was extremely concerned at the aversion he had taken to my maid Amy,
and used my utmost skill to get it altered; for though he had, indeed,
debauched the wench, I knew that I was the principal occasion of it; and
as he was the best-humoured man in the world, I never gave him over till
I prevailed with him to be easy with her, and as I was now become the
devil's agent, to make others as wicked as myself, I brought him to lie
with her again several times after that, till at last, as the poor girl
said, so it happened, and she was really with child.

She was terribly concerned at it, and so was he too. "Come, my dear,"
says I, "when Rachel put her handmaid to bed to Jacob, she took the
children as her own. Don't be uneasy; I'll take the child as my own. Had
not I a hand in the frolic of putting her to bed to you? It was my fault
as much as yours." So I called Amy, and encouraged her too, and told her
that I would take care of the child and her too, and added the same
argument to her. "For," says I, "Amy, it was all my fault. Did not I
drag your clothes off your back, and put you to bed to him?" Thus I,
that had, indeed, been the cause of all the wickedness between them,
encouraged them both, when they had any remorse about it, and rather
prompted them to go on with it than to repent it.

When Amy grew big she went to a place I had provided for her, and the
neighbours knew nothing but that Amy and I was parted. She had a fine
child indeed, a daughter, and we had it nursed; and Amy came again in
about half a year to live with her old mistress; but neither my
gentleman, or Amy either, cared for playing that game over again; for,
as he said, the jade might bring him a houseful of children to keep.

We lived as merrily and as happily after this as could be expected,
considering our circumstances; I mean as to the pretended marriage, &c.;
and as to that, my gentleman had not the least concern about him for it.
But as much as I was hardened, and that was as much as I believe ever
any wicked creature was, yet I could not help it, there was and would be
hours of intervals and of dark reflections which came involuntarily in,
and thrust in sighs into the middle of all my songs; and there would be
sometimes a heaviness of heart which intermingled itself with all my
joy, and which would often fetch a tear from my eye. And let others
pretend what they will, I believe it impossible to be otherwise with
anybody. There can be no substantial satisfaction in a life of known
wickedness; conscience will, and does often, break in upon them at
particular times, let them do what they can to prevent it.

But I am not to preach, but to relate; and whatever loose reflections
were, and how often soever those dark intervals came on, I did my utmost
to conceal them from him; ay, and to suppress and smother them too in
myself; and, to outward appearance, we lived as cheerfully and agreeably
as it was possible for any couple in the world to live.

After I had thus lived with him something above two years, truly I found
myself with child too. My gentleman was mightily pleased at it, and
nothing could be kinder than he was in the preparations he made for me,
and for my lying-in, which was, however, very private, because I cared
for as little company as possible; nor had I kept up my neighbourly
acquaintance, so that I had nobody to invite upon such an occasion.

I was brought to bed very well (of a daughter too, as well as Amy), but
the child died at about six weeks old, so all that work was to do over
again--that is to say, the charge, the expense, the travail, &c.

The next year I made him amends, and brought him a son, to his great
satisfaction. It was a charming child, and did very well. After this my
husband, as he called himself, came to me one evening, and told me he
had a very difficult thing happened to him, which he knew not what to do
in, or how to resolve about, unless I would make him easy; this was,
that his occasions required him to go over to France for about two
months.

"Well, my dear," says I, "and how shall I make you easy?"

"Why, by consenting to let me go," says he; "upon which condition, I'll
tell you the occasion of my going, that you may judge of the necessity
there is for it on my side." Then, to make me easy in his going, he told
me he would make his will before he went, which should be to my full
satisfaction.

I told him the last part was so kind that I could not decline the first
part, unless he would give me leave to add that, if it was not for
putting him to an extraordinary expense, I would go over along with him.

He was so pleased with this offer that he told me he would give me full
satisfaction for it, and accept of it too; so he took me to London with
him the next day, and there he made his will, and showed it to me, and
sealed it before proper witnesses, and then gave it to me to keep. In
this will he gave a thousand pounds to a person that we both knew very
well, in trust, to pay it, with the interest from the time of his
decease, to me or my assigns; then he willed the payment of my jointure,
as he called it, viz., his bond of five hundred pounds after his death;
also, he gave me a
farther.

I should in this place mention that this prince was not a subject of
France, though at that time he resided at Paris and was much at court,
where, I suppose, he had or expected some considerable employment. But I
mention it on this account, that a few days after this he came to me and
told me he was come to bring me not the most welcome news that ever I
heard from him in his life. I looked at him a little surprised; but he
returned, "Do not be uneasy; it is as unpleasant to me as to you, but I
come to consult with you about it and see if it cannot be made a little
easy to us both."

I seemed still more concerned and surprised. At last he said it was that
he believed he should be obliged to go into Italy, which, though
otherwise it was very agreeable to him, yet his parting with me made it
a very dull thing but to think of.

I sat mute, as one thunderstruck, for a good while; and it presently
occurred to me that I was going to lose him, which, indeed, I could but
ill bear the thoughts of; and as he told me I turned pale. "What's the
matter?" said he hastily. "I have surprised you indeed," and stepping to
the sideboard fills a dram of cordial water, which was of his own
bringing, and comes to me. "Be not surprised," said he; "I'll go nowhere
without you;" adding several other things so kind as nothing could
exceed it.

I might indeed turn pale, for I was very much surprised at first,
believing that this was, as it often happens in such cases, only a
project to drop me, and break off an amour which he had now carried on
so long; and a thousand thoughts whirled about my head in the few
moments while I was kept in suspense, for they were but a few. I say, I
was indeed surprised, and might, perhaps, look pale, but I was not in
any danger of fainting that I knew of.

However, it not a little pleased me to see him so concerned and anxious
about me, but I stopped a little when he put the cordial to my mouth,
and taking the glass in my hand, I said, "My lord, your words are
infinitely more of a cordial to me than this citron; for as nothing can
be a greater affliction than to lose you, so nothing can be a greater
satisfaction than the assurance that I shall not have that misfortune."

He made me sit down, and sat down by me, and after saying a thousand
kind things to me, he turns upon me with a smile: "Why, will you
venture yourself to Italy with me?" says he. I stopped a while, and then
answered that I wondered he would ask me that question, for I would go
anywhere in the world, or all over the world, wherever he should desire
me, and give me the felicity of his company.

Then he entered into a long account of the occasion of his journey, and
how the king had engaged him to go, and some other circumstances which
are not proper to enter into here; it being by no means proper to say
anything that might lead the reader into the least guess at the person.

But to cut short this part of the story, and the history of our journey
and stay abroad, which would almost fill up a volume of itself, I say we
spent all that evening in cheerful consultations about the manner of our
travelling, the equipage and figure he should go in, and in what manner
I should go. Several ways were proposed, but none seemed feasible, till
at last I told him I thought it would be so troublesome, so expensive,
and so public that it would be many ways inconvenient to him; and though
it was a kind of death to me to lose him, yet that, rather than so very
much perplex his affairs, I would submit to anything.

At the next visit I filled his head with the same difficulties, and then
at last came over him with a proposal that I would stay in Paris, or
where else he should direct; and when I heard of his safe arrival, would
come away by myself, and place myself as near him as I could.

This gave him no satisfaction at all, nor would he hear any more of it;
but if I durst venture myself, as he called it, such a journey, he would
not lose the satisfaction of my company; and as for the expense, that
was not to be named; neither, indeed, was there room to name it, for I
found that he travelled at the king's expense, as well for himself as
for all his equipage, being upon a piece of secret service of the last
importance.

But after several debates between ourselves, he came to this resolution,
viz., that he would travel incognito, and so he should avoid all public
notice either of himself or of who went with him; and that then he
should not only carry me with him, but have a perfect leisure of
enjoying my agreeable company (as he was pleased to call it) all the
way.

This was so obliging that nothing could be more so. Upon this foot he
immediately set to work to prepare things for his journey, and, by his
directions, so did I too. But now I had a terrible difficulty upon me,
and which way to get over it I knew not; and that was, in what manner to
take care of what I had to leave behind me. I was rich, as I have said,
very rich, and what to do with it I knew not; nor who to leave in trust
I knew not. I had nobody but Amy in the world, and to travel without Amy
was very uncomfortable, or to leave all I had in the world with her,
and, if she miscarried, be ruined at once, was still a frightful
thought; for Amy might die, and whose hands things might fall into I
knew not. This gave me great uneasiness, and I knew not what to do; for
I could not mention it to the prince, lest he should see that I was
richer than he thought I was.

But the prince made all this easy to me; for in concerting measures for
our journey he started the thing himself, and asked me merrily one
evening who I would trust with all my wealth in my absence.

"My wealth, my lord," said I, "except what I owe to your goodness is but
small, but yet that little I have, I confess, causes some
thoughtfulness, because I have no acquaintance in Paris that I dare
trust with it, nor anybody but my woman to leave in the house; and how
to do without her upon the road I do not well know."

"As to the road, be not concerned," says the prince; "I'll provide you
servants to your mind; and as for your woman, if you can trust her,
leave her here, and I'll put you in a way how to secure things as well
as if you were at home." I bowed, and told him I could not be put into
better hands than his own, and that, therefore, I would govern all my
measures by his directions; so we talked no more of it that night.

The next day he sent me in a great iron chest, so large that it was as
much as six lusty fellows could get up the steps into the house; and in
this I put, indeed, all my wealth; and for my safety he ordered a good,
honest, ancient man and his wife to be in the house with her, to keep
her company, and a maid-servant and boy; so that there was a good
family, and Amy was madam, the mistress of the house.

Things being thus secured, we set out incog., as he called it; but we
had two coaches and six horses, two chaises, and about eight
men-servants on horseback, all very well armed.

Never was woman better used in this world that went upon no other
account than I did. I had three women-servants to wait on me, one
whereof was an old Madame ----, who thoroughly understood her business,
and managed everything as if she had been major-domo; so I had no
trouble. They had one coach to themselves, and the prince and I in the
other; only that sometimes, where he knew it necessary, I went into
their coach, and one particular gentleman of the retinue rode with him.

I shall say no more of the journey than that when we came to those
frightful mountains, the Alps, there was no travelling in our coaches,
so he ordered a horse-litter, but carried by mules, to be provided for
me, and himself went on horseback. The coaches went some other way back
to Lyons. Then we had coaches hired at Turin, which met us at Suza; so
that we were accommodated again, and went by easy journeys afterwards to
Rome, where his business, whatever it was, called him to stay some time,
and from thence to Venice.

He was as good as his word, indeed; for I had the pleasure of his
company, and, in a word, engrossed his conversation almost all the way.
He took delight in showing me everything that was to be seen, and
particularly in telling me something of the history of everything he
showed me.

What valuable pains were here thrown away upon one who he was sure, at
last, to abandon with regret! How below himself did a man of quality and
of a thousand accomplishments behave in all this! It is one of my
reasons for entering into this part, which otherwise would not be worth
relating. Had I been a daughter or a wife, of whom it might be said that
he had a just concern in their instruction or improvement, it had been
an admirable step; but all this to a whore; to one who he carried with
him upon no account that could be rationally agreeable, and none but to
gratify the meanest of human frailties--this was the wonder of it. But
such is the power of a vicious inclination. Whoring was, in a word, his
darling crime, the worst excursion he made, for he was otherwise one of
the most excellent persons in the world. No passions, no furious
excursions, no ostentatious pride; the most humble, courteous, affable
person in the world. Not an oath, not an indecent word, or the least
blemish in behaviour was to be seen in all his conversation, except as
before excepted; and it has given me occasion for many dark reflections
since, to look back and think that I should be the snare of such a
person's life; that I should influence him to so much wickedness, and
that I should be the instrument in the hand of the devil to do him so
much prejudice.

We were near two years upon this grand tour, as it may be called, during
most of which I resided at Rome or at Venice, having only been twice at
Florence and once at Naples. I made some very diverting and useful
observations in all these places, and particularly of the conduct of the
ladies; for I had opportunity to converse very much among them, by the
help of the old witch that travelled with us. She had been at Naples and
at Venice, and had lived in the former several years, where, as I found,
she had lived but a loose life, as indeed the women of Naples generally
do; and, in short, I found she was fully acquainted with all the
intriguing arts of that part of the world.

Here my lord bought me a little female Turkish slave, who, being taken
at sea by a Maltese man-of-war, was brought in there, and of her I
learnt the Turkish language, their way of dressing and dancing, and some
Turkish, or rather Moorish, songs, of which I made use to my advantage
on an extraordinary occasion some years after, as you shall hear in its
place. I need not say I learnt Italian too, for I got pretty well
mistress of that before I had been there a year; and as I had leisure
enough and loved the language, I read all the Italian books I could come
at.

I began to be so in love with Italy, especially with Naples and Venice,
that I could have been very well satisfied to have sent for Amy and have
taken up my residence there for life.

As to Rome, I did not like it at all. The swarms of ecclesiastics of all
kinds on one side, and the scoundrel rabbles of the common people on the
other, make Rome the unpleasantest place in the world to live in. The
innumerable number of valets, lackeys, and other servants is such that
they used to say that there are very few of the common people in Rome
but what have been footmen, or porters, or grooms to cardinals or
foreign ambassadors. In a word, they have an air of sharping and
cozening, quarrelling and scolding, upon their general behaviour; and
when I was there the footmen made such a broil between two great
families in Rome, about which of their coaches (the ladies being in the
coaches on either side) should give way to the other, that there was
about thirty people wounded on both sides, five or six killed outside,
and both the ladies frighted almost to death.

But I have no mind to write the history of my travels on this side of
the world, at least not now; it would be too full of variety.

I must not, however, omit that the prince continued in all this journey
the most kind, obliging person to me in the world, and so constant that,
though we were in a country where it is well known all manner of
liberties are taken, I am yet well assured he neither took the liberty
he knew he might have, or so much as desired it.

I have often thought of this noble person on that account. Had he been
but half so true, so faithful and constant, to the best lady in the
world--I mean his princess--how glorious a virtue had it been in him!
And how free had he been from those just reflections which touched him
in her behalf when it was too late!

We had some very agreeable conversations upon this subject, and once he
told me, with a kind of more than ordinary concern upon his thoughts,
that he was greatly beholden to me for taking this hazardous and
difficult journey, for that I had kept him honest. I looked up in his
face, and coloured as red as fire. "Well, well," says he, "do not let
that surprise you, I do say you have kept me honest." "My lord," said I,
"'tis not for me to explain your words, but I wish I could turn them my
own way. I hope," says I, "and believe we are both as honest as we can
be in our circumstances." "Ay, ay," says he; "and honester than I doubt
I should have been if you had not been with me. I cannot say but if you
had not been here I should have wandered among the gay world here, in
Naples, and in Venice too, for 'tis not such a crime here as 'tis in
other places. But I protest," says he, "I have not touched a woman in
Italy but yourself; and more than that, I have not so much as had any
desire to it. So that, I say, you have kept me honest."

I was silent, and was glad that he interrupted me, or kept me from
speaking, with kissing me, for really I knew not what to say. I was once
going to say that if his lady, the princess, had been with him, she
would doubtless have had the same influence upon his virtue, with
infinitely more advantage to him; but I considered this might give him
offence; and, besides, such things might have been dangerous to the
circumstance I stood in, so it passed off. But I must confess I saw that
he was quite another man as to women than I understood he had always
been before, and it was a particular satisfaction to me that I was
thereby convinced that what he said was true, and that he was, as I may
say, all my own.

I was with child again in this journey, and lay in at Venice, but was
not so happy as before. I brought him another son, and a very fine boy
it was, but it lived not above two months; nor, after the first touches
of affection (which are usual, I believe, to all mothers) were over, was
I sorry the child did not live, the necessary difficulties attending it
in our travelling being considered.

After these several perambulations, my lord told me his business began
to close, and we would think of returning to France, which I was very
glad of, but principally on account of my treasure I had there, which,
as you have heard, was very considerable. It is true I had letters very
frequently from my maid Amy, with accounts that everything was very
safe, and that was very much to my satisfaction. However, as the
prince's negotiations were at an end, and he was obliged to return, I
was very glad to go; so we returned from Venice to Turin, and in the way
I saw the famous city of Milan. From Turin we went over the mountains
again, as before, and our coaches met us at Pont à Voisin, between
Chambery and Lyons; and so, by easy journeys, we arrived safely at
Paris, having been absent two years, wanting about eleven days, as
above.

I found the little family we left just as we left them, and Amy cried
for joy when she saw me, and I almost did the same.

The prince took his leave of me the night before, for, as he told me, he
knew he should be met upon the road by several persons of quality, and
perhaps by the princess herself; so we lay at two different inns that
night, lest some should come quite to the place, as indeed it happened.

After this I saw him not for above twenty days, being taken up in his
family, and also with business; but he sent me his gentleman to tell me
the reason of it, and bid me not be uneasy, and that satisfied me
effectually.

In all this affluence of my good fortune I did not forget that I had
been rich and poor once already alternately, and that I ought to know
that the circumstances I was now in were not to be expected to last
always; that I had one child, and expected another; and if I had bred
often, it would something impair me in the great article that supported
my interest--I mean, what he called beauty; that as that declined, I
might expect the fire would abate, and the warmth with which I was now
so caressed would cool, and in time, like the other mistresses of great
men, I might be dropped again; and that therefore it was my business to
take care that I should fall as softly as I could.

I say, I did not forget, therefore, to make as good provision for
myself as if I had had nothing to have subsisted on but what I now
gained; whereas I had not less than ten thousand pounds, as I said
above, which I had amassed, or secured rather, out of the ruins of my
faithful friend the jeweller, and which he, little thinking of what was
so near him when he went out, told me, though in a kind of a jest, was
all my own, if he was knocked on the head, and which, upon that title, I
took care to preserve.

My greatest difficulty now was how to secure my wealth and to keep what
I had got; for I had greatly added to this wealth by the generous bounty
of the Prince ----, and the more by the private, retired mode of living,
which he rather desired for privacy than parsimony; for he supplied me
for a more magnificent way of life than I desired, if it had been
proper.

I shall cut short the history of this prosperous wickedness with telling
you I brought him a third son, within little more than eleven months
after our return from Italy; that now I lived a little more openly, and
went by a particular name which he gave me abroad, but which I must
omit, viz., the Countess de ----; and had coaches and servants, suitable
to the quality he had given me the appearance of; and, which is more
than usually happens in such cases, this held eight years from the
beginning, during which time, as I had been very faithful to him, so I
must say, as above, that I believe he was so separated to me, that
whereas he usually had two or three women, which he kept privately, he
had not in all that time meddled with any of them, but that I had so
perfectly engrossed him that he dropped them all. Not, perhaps, that he
saved much by it, for I was a very chargeable mistress to him, that I
must acknowledge, but it was all owing to his particular affection to
me, not to my extravagance, for, as I said, he never gave me leave to
ask him for anything, but poured in his favours and presents faster than
I expected, and so fast as I could not have the assurance to make the
least mention of desiring more. Nor do I speak this of my own guess, I
mean about his constancy to me and his quitting all other women; but the
old harridan, as I may call her, whom he made the guide of our
travelling, and who was a strange old creature, told me a thousand
stories of his gallantry, as she called it, and how, as he had no less
than three mistresses at one time, and, as I found, all of her
procuring, he had of a sudden dropped them all, and that he was entirely
lost to both her and them; that they did believe he had fallen into some
new hands, but she could never hear who, or where, till he sent for her
to go this journey; and then the old hag complimented me upon his
choice; that she did not wonder I had so engrossed him; so much beauty,
&c.; and there she stopped.

Upon the whole, I found by her what was, you may be sure, to my
particular satisfaction, viz., that, as above, I had him all my own. But
the highest tide has its ebb; and in all things of this kind there is a
reflux which sometimes, also, is more impetuously violent than the first
aggression. My prince was a man of a vast fortune, though no sovereign,
and therefore there was no probability that the expense of keeping a
mistress could be injurious to him, as to his estate. He had also
several employments, both out of France as well as in it; for, as above,
I say he was not a subject of France, though he lived in that court. He
had a princess, a wife with whom he had lived several years, and a woman
(so the voice of fame reported) the most valuable of her sex, of birth
equal to him, if not superior, and of fortune proportionable; but in
beauty, wit, and a thousand good qualities superior, not to most women,
but even to all her sex; and as to her virtue, the character which was
justly her due was that of, not only the best of princesses, but even
the best of women.

They lived in the utmost harmony, as with such a princess it was
impossible to be otherwise. But yet the princess was not insensible that
her lord had his foibles, that he did make some excursions, and
particularly that he had one favourite mistress, which sometimes
engrossed him more than she (the princess) could wish, or be easily
satisfied with. However, she was so good, so generous, so truly kind a
wife, that she never gave him any uneasiness on this account; except so
much as must arise from his sense of her bearing the affront of it with
such patience, and such a profound respect for him as was in itself
enough to have reformed him, and did sometimes shock his generous mind,
so as to keep him at home, as I may call it, a great while together. And
it was not long before I not only perceived it by his absence, but
really got a knowledge of the reason of it, and once or twice he even
acknowledged it to me.

It was a point that lay not in me to manage. I made a kind of motion
once or twice to him to leave me, and keep himself to her, as he ought
by the laws and rites of matrimony to do, and argued the generosity of
the princess to him, to persuade him; but I was a hypocrite, for had I
prevailed with him really to be honest, I had lost him, which I could
not bear the thoughts of; and he might easily see I was not in earnest.
One time in particular, when I took upon me to talk at this rate, I
found, when I argued so much for the virtue and honour, the birth, and,
above all, the generous usage he found in the person of the princess
with respect to his private amours, and how it should prevail upon him,
&c., I found it began to affect him, and he returned, "And do you
indeed," says he, "persuade me to leave you? Would you have me think
you sincere?" I looked up in his face, smiling. "Not for any other
favourite, my lord," says I; "that would break my heart; but for madam
the princess!" said I; and then I could say no more. Tears followed, and
I sat silent a while. "Well," said he, "if ever I do leave you, it shall
be on the virtuous account; it shall be for the princess; I assure you
it shall be for no other woman." "That's enough, my lord," said I;
"there I ought to submit; and while I am assured it shall be for no
other mistress, I promise your Highness I will not repine; or that, if I
do, it shall be a silent grief; it shall not interrupt your felicity."

All this while I said I knew not what, and said what I was no more able
to do than he was able to leave me; which, at that time, he owned he
could not do--no, not for the princess herself.

But another turn of affairs determined this matter, for the princess was
taken very ill, and, in the opinion of all her physicians, very
dangerously so. In her sickness she desired to speak with her lord, and
to take her leave of him. At this grievous parting she said so many
passionate, kind things to him, lamented that she had left him no
children (she had had three, but they were dead); hinted to him that it
was one of the chief things which gave her satisfaction in death, as to
this world, that she should leave him room to have heirs to his family,
by some princess that should supply her place; with all humility, but
with a Christian earnestness, recommended to him to do justice to such
princess, whoever it should be, from whom, to be sure, he would expect
justice; that is to say, to keep to her singly, according to the
solemnest part of the marriage covenant; humbly asked his Highness's
pardon if she had any way offended him; and appealing to Heaven, before
whose tribunal she was to appear, that she had never violated her honour
or her duty to him, and praying to Jesus and the blessed Virgin for his
Highness; and thus, with the most moving and most passionate expressions
of her affection to him, took her last leave of him, and died the next
day.

This discourse, from a princess so valuable in herself and so dear to
him, and the loss of her following so immediately after, made such deep
impressions on him that he looked back with detestation upon the former
part of his life, grew melancholy and reserved, changed his society and
much of the general conduct of his life, resolved on a life regulated
most strictly by the rules of virtue and piety, and, in a word, was
quite another man.

The first part of his reformation was a storm upon me; for, about ten
days after the princess's funeral, he sent a message to me by his
gentleman, intimating, though in very civil terms, and with a short
preamble or introduction, that he desired I would not take it ill that
he was obliged to let me know that he could see me no more. His
gentleman told me a long story of the new regulation of life his lord
had taken up; and that he had been so afflicted for the loss of his
princess that he thought it would either shorten his life or he would
retire into some religious house, to end his days in solitude.

I need not direct anybody to suppose how I received this news. I was
indeed exceedingly surprised at it, and had much ado to support myself
when the first part of it was delivered, though the gentleman delivered
his errand with great respect, and with all the regard to me that he was
able, and with a great deal of ceremony, also telling me how much he was
concerned to bring me such a message.

But when I heard the particulars of the story at large, and especially
that of the lady's discourse to the prince a little before her death, I
was fully satisfied. I knew very well he had done nothing but what any
man must do that had a true sense upon him of the justice of the
princess's discourse to him, and of the necessity there was of his
altering his course of life, if he intended to be either a Christian or
an honest man. I say, when I heard this I was perfectly easy. I confess
it was a circumstance that it might be reasonably expected should have
wrought something also upon me; I that had so much to reflect upon more
than the prince; that had now no more temptation of poverty, or of the
powerful motive which Amy used with me--namely, comply and live, deny
and starve; I say, I that had no poverty to introduce vice, but was
grown not only well supplied, but rich; and not only rich, but was very
rich; in a word, richer than I knew how to think of, for the truth of it
was, that thinking of it sometimes almost distracted me, for want of
knowing how to dispose of it, and for fear of losing it all again by
some cheat or trick, not knowing anybody that I could commit the trust
of it to.

Besides, I should add, at the close of this affair, that the prince did
not, as I may say, turn me off rudely and with disgust, but with all the
decency and goodness peculiar to himself, and that could consist with a
man reformed and struck with the sense of his having abused so good a
lady as his late princess had been. Nor did he send me away empty, but
did everything like himself; and, in particular, ordered his gentleman
to pay the rent of the house and all the expense of his two sons, and to
tell me how they were taken care of, and where, and also that I might at
all times inspect the usage they had, and if I disliked anything it
should be rectified; and having thus finished everything, he retired
into Lorraine, or somewhere that way, where he had an estate, and I
never heard of him more--I mean, not as a mistress.

Now I was at liberty to go to any part of the world, and take care of my
money myself. The first thing that I resolved to do was to go directly
to England, for there, I thought, being among my country-folks--for I
esteemed myself an Englishwoman, though I was born in France--there, I
say, I thought I could better manage things than in France; at least,
that I would be in less danger of being circumvented and deceived; but
how to get away with such a treasure as I had with me was a difficult
point, and what I was greatly at a loss about.

There was a Dutch merchant in Paris, that was a person of great
reputation for a man of substance and of honesty, but I had no manner of
acquaintance with him, nor did I know how to get acquainted with him, so
as to discover my circumstances to him; but at last I employed my maid
Amy (such I must be allowed to call her, notwithstanding what has been
said of her, because she was in the place of a maid-servant); I say, I
employed my maid Amy to go to him, and she got a recommendation to him
from somebody else, I knew not who, so that she got access to him well
enough.

But now was my case as bad as before, for when I came to him what could
I do? I had money and jewels to a vast value, and I might leave all
those with him; that I might indeed do; and so I might with several
other merchants in Paris, who would give me bills for it, payable at
London; but then I ran a hazard of my money, and I had nobody at London
to send the bills to, and so to stay till I had an account that they
were accepted; for I had not one friend in London that I could have
recourse to, so that indeed I knew not what to do.

In this case I had no remedy but that I must trust somebody, so I sent
Amy to this Dutch merchant, as I said above. He was a little surprised
when Amy came to him and talked to him of remitting a sum of about
twelve thousand pistoles to England, and began to think she came to put
some cheat upon him; but when he found that Amy was but a servant, and
that I came to him myself, the case was altered presently.

When I came to him myself, I presently saw such a plainness in his
dealing and such honesty in his countenance that I made no scruple to
tell him my whole story, viz., that I was a widow, that I had some
jewels to dispose of, and also some money which I had a mind to send to
England, and to follow there myself; but being but a woman, and having
no correspondence in London, or anywhere else, I knew not what to do,
or how to secure my effects.

He dealt very candidly with me, but advised me, when he knew my case so
particularly, to take bills upon Amsterdam, and to go that way to
England; for that I might lodge my treasure in the bank there, in the
most secure manner in the world, and that there he could recommend me to
a man who perfectly understood jewels, and would deal faithfully with me
in the disposing them.

I thanked him, but scrupled very much the travelling so far in a strange
country, and especially with such a treasure about me; that, whether
known or concealed, I did not know how to venture with it. Then he told
me he would try to dispose of them there, that is, at Paris, and convert
them into money, and so get me bills for the whole; and in a few days he
brought a Jew to me, who pretended to buy the jewels. As soon as the Jew
saw the jewels I saw my folly, and it was ten thousand to one but I had
been ruined, and perhaps put to death in as cruel a manner as possible;
and I was put in such a fright by it that I was once upon the point of
flying for my life, and leaving the jewels and money too in the hands of
the Dutchman, without any bills or anything else. The case was thus:--

As soon as the Jew saw the jewels he falls a-jabbering, in Dutch or
Portuguese, to the merchant; and I could presently perceive that they
were in some great surprise, both of them. The Jew held up his hands,
looked at me with some horror, then talked Dutch again, and put himself
into a thousand shapes, twisting his body and wringing up his face this
way and that way in his discourse, stamping with his feet, and throwing
abroad his hands, as if he was not in a rage only, but in a mere fury.
Then he would turn and give a look at me like the devil. I thought I
never saw anything so frightful in my life.

At length I put in a word. "Sir," says I to the Dutch merchant, "what is
all this discourse to my business? What is this gentleman in all these
passions about? I wish, if he is to treat with me, he would speak that I
may understand him; or if you have business of your own between you that
is to be done first, let me withdraw, and I'll come again when you are
at leisure."

"No, no, madam," says the Dutchman very kindly, "you must not go; all
our discourse is about you and your jewels, and you shall hear it
presently; it concerns you very much, I assure you." "Concern me!" says
I. "What can it concern me so much as to put this gentleman into such
agonies, and what makes him give me such devil's looks as he does? Why,
he looks as if he would devour me."

The Jew understood me presently, continuing in a kind of rage, and spoke
in French: "Yes, madam, it does concern you much, very much, very much,"
repeating the words, shaking his head; and then turning to the Dutchman,
"Sir," says he, "pray tell her what is the case." "No," says the
merchant, "not yet; let us talk a little farther of it by ourselves;"
upon which they withdrew into another room, where still they talked very
high, but in a language I did not understand. I began to be a little
surprised at what the Jew had said, you may be sure, and eager to know
what he meant, and was very impatient till the Dutch merchant came back,
and that so impatient that I called one of his servants to let him know
I desired to speak with him. When he came in I asked his pardon for
being so impatient, but told him I could not be easy till he had told me
what the meaning of all this was. "Why, madam," says the Dutch merchant,
"in short, the meaning is what I am surprised at too. This man is a Jew,
and understands jewels perfectly well, and that was the reason I sent
for him, to dispose of them to him for you; but as soon as he saw them,
he knew the jewels very distinctly, and flying out in a passion, as you
see he did, told me, in short, that they were the very parcel of jewels
which the English jeweller had about him who was robbed going to
Versailles, about eight years ago, to show them the Prince de ----, and
that it was for these very jewels that the poor gentleman was murdered;
and he is in all this agony to make me ask you how you came by them; and
he says you ought to be charged with the robbery and murder, and put to
the question to discover who were the persons that did it, that they
might be brought to justice." While he said this the Jew came impudently
back into the room without calling, which a little surprised me again.

The Dutch merchant spoke pretty good English, and he knew that the Jew
did not understand English at all, so he told me the latter part, when
he came into the room, in English, at which I smiled, which put the Jew
into his mad fit again, and shaking his head and making his devil's
faces again, he seemed to threaten me for laughing, saying, in French,
this was an affair I should have little reason to laugh at, and the
like. At this I laughed again, and flouted him, letting him see that I
scorned him, and turning to the Dutch merchant, "Sir," says I, "that
those jewels were belonging to Mr. ----, the English jeweller" (naming
his name readily), "in that," says I, "this person is right; but that I
should be questioned how I came to have them is a token of his
ignorance, which, however, he might have managed with a little more good
manners, till I told him who I am, and both he and you too will be more
easy in that part when I should tell you that I am the unhappy widow of
that Mr. ---- who was so barbarously murdered going to Versailles, and
that he was not robbed of those jewels, but of others, Mr. ---- having
left those behind him with me, lest he should be robbed. Had I, sir,
come otherwise by them, I should not have been weak enough to have
exposed them to sale here, where the thing was done, but have carried
them farther off."

This was an agreeable surprise to the Dutch merchant, who, being an
honest man himself, believed everything I said, which, indeed, being all
really and literally true, except the deficiency of my marriage, I spoke
with such an unconcerned easiness that it might plainly be seen that I
had no guilt upon me, as the Jew suggested.

The Jew was confounded when he heard that I was the jeweller's wife. But
as I had raised his passion with saying he looked at me with the devil's
face, he studied mischief in his heart, and answered, that should not
serve my turn; so called the Dutchman out again, when he told him that
he resolved to prosecute this matter farther.

There was one kind chance in this affair, which, indeed, was my
deliverance, and that was, that the fool could not restrain his passion,
but must let it fly to the Dutch merchant, to whom, when they withdrew a
second time, as above, he told that he would bring a process against me
for the murder, and that it should cost me dear for using him at that
rate; and away he went, desiring the Dutch merchant to tell him when I
would be there again. Had he suspected that the Dutchman would have
communicated the particulars to me, he would never have been so foolish
as to have mentioned that part to him.

But the malice of his thoughts anticipated him, and the Dutch merchant
was so good as to give me an account of his design, which, indeed, was
wicked enough in its nature; but to me it would have been worse than
otherwise it would to another, for, upon examination, I could not have
proved myself to be the wife of the jeweller, so the suspicion might
have been carried on with the better face; and then I should also have
brought all his relations in England upon me, who, finding by the
proceedings that I was not his wife, but a mistress, or, in English, a
whore, would immediately have laid claim to the jewels, as I had owned
them to be his.

This thought immediately rushed into my head as soon as the Dutch
merchant had told me what wicked things were in the head of that cursed
Jew; and the villain (for so I must call him) convinced the Dutch
merchant that he was in earnest by an expression which showed the rest
of his design, and that was, a plot to get the rest of the jewels into
his hand.

When first he hinted to the Dutchman that the jewels were such a man's
(meaning my husband's), he made wonderful exclamations on account of
their having been concealed so long. Where must they have lain? And what
was the woman that brought them? And that she (meaning me) ought to be
immediately apprehended and put into the hands of justice. And this was
the time that, as I said, he made such horrid gestures and looked at me
so like a devil.

The merchant, hearing him talk at that rate, and seeing him in earnest,
said to him, "Hold your tongue a little; this is a thing of consequence.
If it be so, let you and I go into the next room and consider of it
there;" and so they withdrew, and left me.

Here, as before, I was uneasy, and called him out, and, having heard how
it was, gave him that answer, that I was his wife, or widow, which the
malicious Jew said should not serve my turn. And then it was that the
Dutchman called him out again; and in this time of his withdrawing, the
merchant, finding, as above, that he was really in earnest,
counterfeited a little to be of his mind, and entered into proposals
with him for the thing itself.

In this they agreed to go to an advocate, or counsel, for directions how
to proceed, and to meet again the next day, against which time the
merchant was to appoint me to come again with the jewels, in order to
sell them. "No," says the merchant, "I will go farther with her than so;
I will desire her to leave the jewels with me, to show to another
person, in order to get the better price for them." "That's right," says
the Jew; "and I'll engage she shall never be mistress of them again;
they shall either be seized by us," says he, "in the king's name, or she
shall be glad to give them up to us to prevent her being put to the
torture."

The merchant said "Yes" to everything he offered, and they agreed to
meet the next morning about it, and I was to be persuaded to leave the
jewels with him, and come to them the next day at four o'clock in order
to make a good bargain for them; and on these conditions they parted.
But the honest Dutchman, filled with indignation at the barbarous
design, came directly to me and told me the whole story. "And now,
madam," says he, "you are to consider immediately what you have to do."

I told him, if I was sure to have justice, I would not fear all that
such a rogue could do to me; but how such things were carried on in
France I knew not. I told him the greatest difficulty would be to prove
our marriage, for that it was done in England, and in a remote part of
England too; and, which was worse, it would be hard to produce authentic
vouchers of it, because we were married in private. "But as to the death
of your husband, madam, what can be said to that?" said he. "Nay," said
I, "what can they say to it? In England," added I, "if they would offer
such an injury to any one, they must prove the fact or give just reason
for their suspicions. That my husband was murdered, that every one
knows; but that he was robbed, or of what, or how much, that none
knows--no, not myself; and why was I not questioned for it then? I have
lived in Paris ever since, lived publicly, and no man had yet the
impudence to suggest such a thing of me."

"I am fully satisfied of that," says the merchant; "but as this is a
rogue who will stick at nothing, what can we say? And who knows what he
may swear? Suppose he should swear that he knows your husband had those
particular jewels with him the morning when he went out, and that he
showed them to him to consider their value, and what price he should ask
the Prince de ---- for them?"

"Nay, by the same rule," said I, "he may swear that I murdered my
husband, if he finds it for his turn." "That's true," said he; "and if
he should, I do not see what could save you;" but added, "I have found
out his more immediate design. His design is to have you carried to the
Châtelet, that the suspicion may appear just, and then to get the jewels
out of your hands if possible; then, at last, to drop the prosecution on
your consenting to quit the jewels to him; and how you will do to avoid
this is the question which I would have you consider of."

"My misfortune, sir," said I, "is that I have no time to consider, and I
have no person to consider with or advise about it. I find that
innocence may be oppressed by such an impudent fellow as this; he that
does not value perjury has any man's life at his mercy. But, sir," said
I, "is the justice such here that, while I may be in the hands of the
public and under prosecution, he may get hold of my effects and get my
jewels into his hands?"

"I don't know," says he, "what may be done in that case; but if not he,
if the court of justice should get hold of them I do not know but you
may find it as difficult to get them out of their hands again, and, at
least, it may cost you half as much as they are worth; so I think it
would be a much better way to prevent their coming at them at all."

"But what course can I take to do that," says I, "now they have got
notice that I have them? If they get me into their hands they will
oblige me to produce them, or perhaps sentence me to prison till I do."

"Nay," says he, "as this brute says, too, put you to the question--that
is, to the torture, on pretence of making you confess who were the
murderers of your husband."

"Confess!" said I. "How can I confess what I know nothing of?"

"If they come to have you to the rack," said he, "they will make you
confess you did it yourself, whether you did it or no, and then you are
cast."

The very word rack frighted me to death almost, and I had no spirit left
in me. "Did it myself!" said I. "That's impossible!"

"No, madam," says he, "'tis far from impossible. The most innocent
people in the world have been forced to confess themselves guilty of
what they never heard of, much less had any hand in."

"What, then, must I do?" said I. "What would you advise me to?"

"Why," says he, "I would advise you to be gone. You intended to go away
in four or five days, and you may as well go in two days; and if you can
do so, I shall manage it so that he shall not suspect your being gone
for several days after." Then he told me how the rogue would have me
ordered to bring the jewels the next day for sale, and that then he
would have me apprehended; how he had made the Jew believe he would join
with him in his design, and that he (the merchant) would get the jewels
into his hands. "Now," says the merchant, "I shall give you bills for
the money you desired, immediately, and such as shall not fail of being
paid. Take your jewels with you, and go this very evening to St.
Germain-en-Laye; I'll send a man thither with you, and from thence he
shall guide you to-morrow to Rouen, where there lies a ship of mine,
just ready to sail for Rotterdam; you shall have your passage in that
ship on my account, and I will send orders for him to sail as soon as
you are on board, and a letter to my friend at Rotterdam to entertain
and take care of you."

This was too kind an offer for me, as things stood, not to be accepted,
and be thankful for; and as to going away, I had prepared everything for
parting, so that I had little to do but to go back, take two or three
boxes and bundles, and such things, and my maid Amy, and be gone.

Then the merchant told me the measures he had resolved to take to delude
the Jew while I made my escape, which was very well contrived indeed.
"First," said he, "when he comes to-morrow I shall tell him that I
proposed to you to leave the jewels with me, as we agreed, but that you
said you would come and bring them in the afternoon, so that we must
stay for you till four o'clock; but then, at that time, I will show a
letter from you, as if just come in, wherein you shall excuse your not
coming, for that some company came to visit you, and prevented you; but
that you desire me to take care that the gentleman be ready to buy your
jewels, and that you will come to-morrow at the same hour, without
fail.

"When to-morrow is come, we shall wait at the time, but you not
appearing, I shall seem most dissatisfied, and wonder what can be the
reason; and so we shall agree to go the next day to get out a process
against you. But the next day, in the morning, I'll send to give him
notice that you have been at my house, but he not being there, have made
another appointment, and that I desire to speak with him. When he comes,
I'll tell him you appear perfectly blind as to your danger, and that you
appeared much disappointed that he did not come, though you could not
meet the night before; and obliged me to have him here to-morrow at
three o'clock. When to-morrow comes," says he, "you shall send word that
you are taken so ill that you cannot come out for that day, but that you
will not fail the next day; and the next day you shall neither come or
send, nor let us ever hear any more of you; for by that time you shall
be in Holland, if you please."

I could not but approve all his measures, seeing they were so well
contrived, and in so friendly a manner, for my benefit; and as he seemed
to be so very sincere, I resolved to put my life in his hands.
Immediately I went to my lodgings, and sent away Amy with such bundles
as I had prepared for my travelling. I also sent several parcels of my
fine furniture to the merchant's house to be laid up for me, and
bringing the key of the lodgings with me, I came back to his house. Here
we finished our matters of money, and I delivered into his hands seven
thousand eight hundred pistoles in bills and money, a copy of an
assignment on the townhouse of Paris for four thousand pistoles, at
three per cent. interest, attested, and a procuration for receiving the
interest half-yearly; but the original I kept myself.

I could have trusted all I had with him, for he was perfectly honest,
and had not the least view of doing me any wrong. Indeed, after it was
so apparent that he had, as it were, saved my life, or at least saved me
from being exposed and ruined--I say, after this, how could I doubt him
in anything?

When I came to him, he had everything ready as I wanted, and as he had
proposed. As to my money, he gave me first of all an accepted bill,
payable at Rotterdam, for four thousand pistoles, and drawn from Genoa
upon a merchant at Rotterdam, payable to a merchant at Paris, and
endorsed by him to my merchant; this, he assured me, would be punctually
paid; and so it was, to a day. The rest I had in other bills of
exchange, drawn by himself upon other merchants in Holland. Having
secured my jewels too, as well as I could, he sent me away the same
evening in a friend's coach, which he had procured for me, to St.
Germain, and the next morning to Rouen. He also sent a servant of his
own on horseback with me, who provided everything for me, and who
carried his orders to the captain of the ship, which lay about three
miles below Rouen, in the river, and by his directions I went
immediately on board. The third day after I was on board the ship went
away, and we were out at sea the next day after that; and thus I took your
fortune to me, and even at this time, notwithstanding the appearance we
make in the world, I am not worth a third of what I was when we came to
settle in Holland; and then, here is our own son shall be provided for
in a handsome manner by me; for I am thoroughly convinced there will be
but little care taken of him if I leave anything in your power for that
purpose: witness Thomas and Susanna."

"My lord," said I, "I am not come into your chamber to know what care
you have taken of our child. I do not doubt but you have acted like a
father by it. What I would be informed in is, what I am to depend upon
in case of your decease; which I, however, hope may be a great many
years off yet." "You need not concern yourself about that," said he;
"your son will take care that you shall not want; but yet, I will tell
you, too," said he, "that it may prevent your wishing for my death. I
have, in my will, left all I am possessed of in the world to my son,
excepting £1500; out of that there is £500 for you, £500 among my
executors, and the other £500 is to bury me, pay my funeral expenses,
and what is overplus I have ordered to be equally divided among my
servants."

When I had heard him pronounce these words, I stared like one that was
frightened out of his senses. "Five hundred pounds for me!" says I;
"pray, what do you mean? What! am I, that brought you so handsome a
fortune, to be under the curb of my son, and ask him for every penny I
want? No, sir," said I, "I will not accept it. I expect to be left in
full possession of one-half of your fortune, that I may live the
remainder of my life like your wife." "Madam," replied my lord, "you may
expect what you please. If you can make it appear since I found you out
to be a jilt that I have looked upon you as my wife, everything shall be
altered and settled just as you desire, which might then be called your
will; but as the case now stands, the will is mine, and so it shall
remain."

I thought I should have sunk when I had heard him make this solemn and
premeditated declaration. I raved like a mad woman, and, at the end of
my discourse, told him that I did not value what could happen to me,
even if I was forced to beg my bread, for I would stand the test of my
own character; and as I could get nothing by being an honest woman, so
I should not scruple to declare that "the son you have left what you
have to is a bastard you had by me several years before we were
married."

"Oh," says he, "madam, do you think you can frighten me? no, not in the
least; for if you ever mention anything of it, the title, as well as all
the estate, will go to another branch of my family, and you will then be
left to starve in good earnest, without having the least glimpse of hope
to better your fortune; for," added he, "it is not very probable that
you will be courted for a wife by any man of substance at these years;
so if you have a mind to make yourself easy in your present
circumstances, you must rest contented with what I have left you, and
not prove yourself a whore to ruin your child, in whose power it will be
to provide for you in a handsome manner, provided you behave yourself
with that respect to him and me as you ought to do; for if any words
arise about what I have done, I shall make a fresh will, and, as the
laws of this nation will give me liberty, cut you off with a shilling."

My own unhappiness, and his strong and lasting resentment, had kept me
at high words, and flowing in tears, for some time; and as I was
unwilling anybody should see me in that unhappy condition, I stayed
coolly talking to him, till our son, who had been to several gentlemen's
houses about my lord's business, came home to tell his father the
success he had met with abroad. He brought in with him bank-notes to
the amount of £12,000, which he had received of some merchants he held a
correspondence with; at which my lord was well pleased, for he was
pretty near out of money at this juncture. After our son had delivered
the accounts and bills, and had withdrawn, I asked my lord, in a calm
tone, to give me the satisfaction of knowing in what manner the losses
he had complained to have suffered consisted. "You must consider, my
lord," said I, "that according to what you have been pleased to inform
me of, we are upwards of £2000 per annum, besides about £17,000 ready
money, poorer than we were when we first came to settle in Holland."

"You talk," replied my lord, "in a very odd manner. Do not you know that
I had children of my own by a former wife? and of these I have taken so
much care as to provide with very handsome fortunes, which are settled
irrevocably upon them. I have, Providence be thanked, given each of them
£5000, and that is laid in East India stock, sufficient to keep them
genteelly, above the frowns of fortune, and free from the fear of want.
This, joined to the money I mentioned to you before, as losses at sea,
deaths, and bankruptcies, your children's fortunes, which are larger
than my own children's, the buying the estate we live on, and several
other things, which my receipts and notes will account for, as you may
see after my decease. I have, to oblige you on this head, almost
descended to particulars, which I never thought to have done; but as I
have, rest yourself contented, and be well assured that I have not
wilfully thrown any of your substance away."

I could not tell what he meant by saying he had not wilfully thrown any
of my substance away. These words puzzled me, for I found by his
discourse I was to have but £500 of all I had brought him, at his
decease, which I looked upon to be near at hand. I had but one thing
that was any satisfaction to me, which was this: I was assured by him
that he had not bestowed above the £15,000 he mentioned to me, on his
children by his former wife; and, on an exact calculation, he made it
appear that he had bestowed on my son Thomas alone near £13,000 in
buying the plantation, shares in vessels, and merchandise, besides
several valuable presents sent to his wife, both by him and me; and as
for my daughter Susanna, she was very well married to a factor, with a
fortune of £2000 (which was a great sum of money for a woman to have who
was immediately to go to the East Indies), besides some handsome
presents given to her both by him and me. In fact, her fortune was, in
proportion, as large as her brother's, for there is but very few women
in England or Holland with £2000 fortune that would venture to the coast
of Malabar, even to have married an Indian king, much more to have gone
over with a person that no one could tell what reception he might meet
with, or might be recalled at the pleasure of the Company upon the least
distaste taken by the merchants against him. Neither would I, though her
own mother, hinder her voyage, for she had been the author of all the
misfortunes that happened to me; and if my speaking a word would have
saved her from the greatest torment, I believe I should have been quite
silent. And I had but one reason to allege for the girl's going so
hazardous a voyage, which is, she knew that the match was proposed by my
lord, and if he had not thought it would have been advantageous for her,
he would never have given £2000 to her husband as a fortune; and again,
as my lord was the only friend she had in our family, she was cunning
enough to know that the bare disobliging of him would have been her ruin
for ever after; to which I may add, that it is possible, as she had made
so much mischief about me, she was glad to get what she could and go out
of the way, for fear my lord and I should be friends; which, if that had
happened, she would have been told never to come to our house any more.

As my lord's death began to be daily the discourse of the family, I
thought that he might be more reconciled if I entered into the arguments
again, pro and con, which we had together before. I did so, but all I
could say was no satisfaction, till I importuned him on my knees, with a
flood of tears. "Madam," said he, "what would you have me do?" "Do, my
lord," said I, "only be so tender to my years and circumstances as to
alter your will, or, at least, add a codicil to it; I desire nothing
more, for I declare I had rather be a beggar, than live under my
child's jurisdiction." To this he agreed with some reluctance, and he
added a codicil to his will.

This pleased me greatly, and gave me comfort, for I dreaded nothing so
much, after all my high living, as being under any person, relation or
stranger, and whether they exercised any power over me or not.

I saw the lawyer come out of the chamber first, but was above asking him
any questions; the next were the executors and chaplain. I asked the
last how they came to have words. He did not answer me directly, but
begged to know whose pleasure it was to have the codicil annexed. "It
was mine, sir," replied I; "and it made me very uneasy before I could
have the favour granted." He only replied by saying, "Ah! poor lady, the
favour, as you are pleased to term it, is not calculated for any benefit
to you; think the worst you can of it."

I was terribly uneasy at what the chaplain had said, but I imagined to
myself that I could not be worse off than I thought I should be before
the codicil was annexed; and as he withdrew without saying any more, I
was fain to rest satisfied with what I had heard, and that amounted to
nothing.

The next day after this the physicians that attended my lord told him it
was time for him to settle his worldly affairs, and prepare himself for
a hereafter. I now found all was over, and I had no other hopes of his
life than the physicians' declaration of his being near his death. For
it often happens that the gentlemen of the faculty give out that a man
is near his death, to make the cure appear to be the effect of their
great skill in distempers and medicine; as others, when they cannot find
out the real disease, give out that a man's end is near, rather than
discover their want of judgment; and this I thought might be the case
with our doctors of physic.

Our son was still kept from the university, and lodged at the house of
one of his future guardians; but when he heard that his father was so
near his end, he was very little out of his presence, for he dearly
loved him. My lord sent the day before his death to lock and seal up all
the doors in his dwelling house at The Hague; and the steward had
orders, in case of my lord's decease, not to let anybody come in, not
even his lady (who had for some time lodged in the same house with her
lord), without an order from the executors.

The keys of the doors were carried to him, and as he saw his death
approach, he prepared for it, and, in fact, resigned up the keys of
everything to the executors, and having bid them all a farewell, they
were dismissed. The physicians waited; but as the verge of life
approached, and it was out of their power to do him any service, he gave
them a bill of £100 for the care they had taken of him, and dismissed
them.

I now went into the chamber, and kneeling by his bedside, kissed him
with great earnestness, and begged of him, if ever I had disobliged him
in any respect, to forgive me. He sighed, and said he most freely
forgave me everything that I had reason to think I had offended him in;
but he added, "If you had been so open in your conversation to me before
our marriage as to discover your family and way of life, I know not but
that I should have married you as I did. I might now have been in a good
state of health, and you many years have lived with all the honours due
to the Countess de Wintselsheim." These words drew tears from my eyes,
and they being the last of any consequence he said, they had the greater
impression upon me. He faintly bid me a long farewell, and said, as he
had but a few moments to live, he hoped I would retire, and leave him
with our son and chaplain. I withdrew into my own chamber, almost
drowned in tears, and my son soon followed me out, leaving the chaplain
with his father, offering up his prayers to Heaven for the receiving of
his soul into the blessed mansions of eternal bliss.

A few minutes after our son went into the chamber with me again, and
received his father's last blessing. The chaplain now saw him departing,
and was reading the prayer ordered by the Church for that occasion; and
while he was doing it, my lord laid his head gently on the pillow, and
turning on his left side, departed this life with all the calmness of a
composed mind, without so much as a groan, in the fifty-seventh year of
his age.

As soon as he was dead an undertaker was sent for, by order of the
executors, who met together immediately to open his will, and take care
of all my son's effects. I was present when it was opened and read; but
how terribly I was frightened at hearing the codicil repeated any person
may imagine by the substance of it, which was to this effect; that if I
had given me any more after his decease than the £500 he had left me,
the £500 left to his executors, and the £1000 of my son's estate (which
was now a year's interest), was to be given to such poor families at The
Hague as were judged to be in the greatest want of it; not to be divided
into equal sums, but every family to have according to their merit and
necessity. But this was not all. My son was tied down much harder; for
if it was known that he gave me any relief, let my condition be ever so
bad, either by himself, by his order, or in any manner of way, device,
or contrivance that he could think of, one-half of his estate, which was
particularly mentioned, was to devolve to the executors for ever; and if
they granted me ever so small a favour, that sum was to be equally
divided among the several parishes where they lived, for the benefit of
the poor.

Any person would have been surprised to have seen how we all sat staring
at each other; for though it was signed by all the executors, yet they
did not know the substance of it till it was publicly read, excepting
the chaplain; and he, as I mentioned before, had told me the codicil had
better never have been added.

I was now in a fine dilemma; had the title of a countess, with £500, and
nothing else to subsist on but a very good wardrobe of clothes, which
were not looked upon by my son and the executors to be my late lord's
property, and which were worth, indeed, more than treble the sum I had
left me.

I immediately removed from the lodgings, and left them to bury the body
when they thought proper, and retired to a lodging at a private
gentleman's house, about a mile from The Hague. I was now resolved to
find out Amy, being, as it were, at liberty; and accordingly went to the
house where she had lived, and finding that empty, inquired for her
among the neighbours, who gave various accounts of what had become of
her; but one of them had a direction left at his house where she might
be found. I went to the place and found the house shut up, and all the
windows broken, the sign taken down, and the rails and benches pulled
from before the door. I was quite ashamed to ask for her there, for it
was a very scandalous neighbourhood, and I concluded that Amy had been
brought to low circumstances, and had kept a house of ill-fame, and was
either run away herself, or was forced to it by the officers of justice.
However, as nobody knew me here, I went into a shop to buy some trifles,
and asked who had lived in the opposite house (meaning Amy's). "Really,
madam," says the woman, "I do not well know; but it was a woman who kept
girls for gentlemen; she went on in that wickedness for some time, till
a gentleman was robbed there of his watch and a diamond ring, on which
the women were all taken up, and committed to the house of correction;
but the young ones are now at liberty, and keep about the town." "Pray,"
said I, "what may have become of the old beast that could be the ruin of
those young creatures?" "Why, I do not well know," says she; "but I have
heard that, as all her goods were seized upon, she was sent to the
poorhouse; but it soon after appearing that she had the French disease
to a violent degree, was removed to a hospital to be taken care of, but
I believe she will never live to come out; and if she should be so
fortunate, the gentleman that was robbed, finding that she was the
guilty person, intends to prosecute her to the utmost rigour of the
law."

I was sadly surprised to hear this character of Amy; for I thought
whatever house she might keep, that the heyday of her blood had been
over. But I found that she had not been willing to be taken for an old
woman, though near sixty years of age; and my not seeing or hearing from
her for some time past was a confirmation of what had been told me.

I went home sadly dejected, considering how I might hear of her. I had
known her for a faithful servant to me, in all my bad and good fortune,
and was sorry that at the last such a miserable end should overtake her,
though she, as well as I, deserved it several years before.

A few days after I went pretty near the place I had heard she was, and
hired a poor woman to go and inquire how Amy ---- did, and whether she
was likely to do well. The woman returned, and told me that the matron,
or mistress, said, the person I inquired after died in a salivation two
days before, and was buried the last night in the cemetery belonging to
the hospital.

I was very sorry to hear of Amy's unhappy and miserable death; for when
she came first into my service she was really a sober girl, very witty
and brisk, but never impudent, and her notions in general were good,
till my forcing her, as it were, to have an intrigue with the jeweller.
She had also lived with me between thirty and forty years, in the
several stages of life as I had passed through; and as I had done
nothing but what she was privy to, so she was the best person in the
universal world to consult with and take advice from, as my
circumstances now were.

I returned to my lodgings much chagrined, and very disconsolate; for as
I had for several years lived at the pinnacle of splendour and
satisfaction, it was a prodigious heart-break to me now to fall from
upwards of £3000 per annum to a poor £500 principal.

A few days after this I went to see my son, the Earl of Wintselsheim. He
received me in a very courteous (though far from a dutiful) manner. We
talked together near an hour upon general things, but had no particular
discourse about my late lord's effects, as I wanted to have. Among
other things he told me that his guardians had advised him to go to the
university for four years longer, when he would come of age, and his
estate would be somewhat repaired; to which he said he had agreed; and
for that purpose all the household goods and equipages were to be
disposed of the next week, and the servants dismissed. I immediately
asked if it would be looked upon as an encroachment upon his father's
will if I took Isabel (who had been my waiting-maid ever since I came
from England) to live with me. "No, my lady," very readily replied he;
"as she will be dismissed from me, she is certainly at liberty and full
freedom to do for herself as soon and in the best manner she possibly
can." After this I stayed about a quarter of an hour with him, and then
I sent for Isabel, to know if she would come and live with me on her
dismission from her lord's. The girl readily consented, for I had always
been a good mistress to her; and then I went to my own lodgings in my
son's coach, which he had ordered to be got ready to carry me home.

Isabel came, according to appointment, about ten days after, and told me
the house was quite cleared both of men and movables, but said her lord
(meaning my son) was not gone to the university as yet, but was at one
of his guardians' houses, where he would stay about a month, and that he
intended to make a visit before his departure, which he did, attended by
my late chaplain; and I, being in handsome lodgings, received them with
all the complaisance and love as was possible, telling them that time
and circumstances having greatly varied with me, whatever they saw amiss
I hoped they would be so good as to look over it at that time, by
considering the unhappy situation of my affairs.

After this visit was over, and I had myself and Isabel to provide for,
handsome lodgings to keep (which were as expensive as they were fine),
and nothing but my principal money to live on (I mean what I happened to
have in my pocket at my lord's death, for I had not been paid my £500 as
yet), I could not manage for a genteel maintenance as I had done some
years before. I thought of divers things to lay my small sums out to
advantage, but could fix on nothing; for it always happens that when
people have but a trifle, they are very dubious in the disposal of it.

Having been long resolving in my mind, I at last fixed on merchandise as
the most genteel and profitable of anything else. Accordingly I went to
a merchant who was intimate with my late lord, and letting him know how
my circumstances were, he heartily condoled with me, and told me he
could help me to a share in two ships--one was going a trading voyage to
the coast of Africa, and the other a-privateering. I was now in a
dilemma, and was willing to have a share in the trader, but was dubious
of being concerned in the privateer; for I had heard strange stories
told of the gentlemen concerned in that way of business. Nay, I had
been told, but with what certainty I cannot aver, that there was a set
of men who took upon them to issue ships, and as they always knew to
what port they are bound, notice was sent to their correspondent abroad
to order out their privateers on the coast the other sailed, and they
knowing the loading, and the numbers of hands and guns were on board,
soon made prizes of the vessels, and the profits were equally divided,
after paying what was paid for their insurance, among them all.

However, I at last resolved, by the merchant's advice, to have a share
in the trader, and the next day he over-persuaded me to have a share in
the privateer also. But that I may not lay out my money before I have
it, it may not be amiss to observe that I went to the executors and
received my £500 at an hour's notice, and then went to the merchant's to
know what the shares would come to, and being told £1500, I was resolved
to raise the money; so I went home, and, with my maid Isabel, in two
days' time disposed of as many of my clothes as fetched me near £1100,
which, joined to the above sum, I carried to the merchant's, where the
writings were drawn, signed, sealed, and delivered to me in the presence
of two witnesses, who went with me for that purpose. The ships were near
ready for sailing; the trader was so well manned and armed, as well as
the privateer, that the partners would not consent to insure them, and
out they both sailed, though from different ports, and I depended on
getting a good estate between them.

When I was about this last ship a letter came from the count, my son,
full of tender expressions of his duty to me, in which I was informed
that he was going again to the university at Paris, where he should
remain four years; after that he intended to make the tour of Europe,
and then come and settle at The Hague. I returned him thanks in a letter
for his compliment, wished him all happiness, and a safe return to
Holland, and desired that he would write to me from time to time that I
might hear of his welfare, which was all I could now expect of him. But
this was the last time I heard from him, or he from me.

In about a month's time the news came that the privateer (which sailed
under British colours, and was divided into eight shares) had taken a
ship, and was bringing it into the Texel, but that it accidentally
foundered, and being chained to the privateer, had, in sinking, like to
have lost that too. Two or three of the hands got on shore, and came to
The Hague; but how terribly I was alarmed any one may judge, when I
heard the ship the privateer had was the Newfoundland merchantman, as I
had bought two shares in out of four. About two months after news was
current about The Hague of a privateer or merchantman, one of them of
the town, though not known which, having an engagement in the
Mediterranean, in which action both the privateer and trader was lost.
Soon after their names were publicly known, and, in the end, my partners
heard that they were our ships, and unhappily sailing under false
colours (a thing often practised in the time of war), and never having
seen each other, had, at meeting, a very smart engagement, each fighting
for life and honour, till two unfortunate shots; one of them, viz., the
privateer, was sunk by a shot between wind and water, and the trader
unhappily blown up by a ball falling in the powder-room. There were only
two hands of the trader, and three of the privateer, that escaped, and
they all fortunately met at one of the partners' houses, where they
confirmed the truth of this melancholy story, and to me a fatal loss.

What was to be done now? I had no money, and but few clothes left;
there, was no hope of subsistence from my son or his guardians; they
were tied down to be spectators of my misfortunes, without affording me
any redress, even if they would.

Isabel, though I was now reduced to the last penny, would live with me
still, and, as I observed before and may now repeat, I was in a pretty
situation to begin the world--upwards of sixty years of age, friendless,
scanty of clothes, and but very little money.

I proposed to Isabel to remove from lodgings and retire to Amsterdam,
where I was not known, and might turn myself into some little way of
business, and work for that bread now which had been too often
squandered away upon very trifles. And upon consideration I found myself
in a worse condition than I thought, for I had nothing to recommend me
to Heaven, either in works or thoughts; had even banished from my mind
all the cardinal and moral virtues, and had much more reason to hide
myself from the sight of God, if possible, than I had to leave The
Hague, that I might not be known of my fellow-creatures. And farther to
hasten our removing to Amsterdam, I recollected I was involved in debt
for money to purchase a share in the Newfoundland trader, which was
lost, and my creditors daily threatened me with an arrest to make me pay
them.

I soon discharged my lodgings and went with Isabel to Amsterdam, where I
thought, as I was advanced in years, to give up all I could raise in the
world, and on the sale of everything I had to go into one of the
Proveniers' houses, where I should be settled for life. But as I could
not produce enough money for it, I turned it into a coffee-house near
the Stadt-house, where I might have done well; but as soon as I was
settled one of my Hague creditors arrested me for a debt of £75, and I
not having a friend in the world of whom to raise the money, was, in a
shameful condition, carried to the common jail, where poor Isabel
followed me with showers of tears, and left me inconsolable for my great
misfortunes. Here, without some very unforeseen accident, I shall never
go out of it until I am carried to my grave, for which my much-offended
God prepare me as soon as possible.

_The continuation of the Life of Roxana, by Isabel Johnson, who had
been her waiting-maid, from the time she was thrown into jail to
the time of her death._

After my lady, as it was my duty to call her, was thrown into jail for a
debt she was unable to pay, she gave her mind wholly up to devotion.
Whether it was from a thorough sense of her wretched state, or any other
reason, I could never learn; but this I may say, that she was a sincere
penitent, and in every action had all the behaviour of a Christian. By
degrees all the things she had in the world were sold, and she began to
find an inward decay upon her spirits. In this interval she repeated all
the passages of her ill-spent life to me, and thoroughly repented of
every bad action, especially the little value she had for her children,
which were honestly born and bred. And having, as she believed, made her
peace with God, she died with mere grief on the 2nd of July 1742, in the
sixty-fifth year of her age, and was decently buried by me in the
churchyard belonging to the Lutherans, in the city of Amsterdam.

THE END.

n
together; for Miss Bridget rings her bell, and Mr Allworthy is
summoned to breakfast, where I must attend, and, if you please, shall
be glad of your company.

The usual compliments having past between Mr Allworthy and Miss
Bridget, and the tea being poured out, he summoned Mrs Wilkins, and
told his sister he had a present for her, for which she thanked
him--imagining, I suppose, it had been a gown, or some ornament for
her person. Indeed, he very often made her such presents; and she, in
complacence to him, spent much time in adorning herself. I say in
complacence to him, because she always exprest the greatest contempt
for dress, and for those ladies who made it their study.

But if such was her expectation, how was she disappointed when Mrs
Wilkins, according to the order she had received from her master,
produced the little infant? Great surprizes, as hath been observed,
are apt to be silent; and so was Miss Bridget, till her brother began,
and told her the whole story, which, as the reader knows it already,
we shall not repeat.

Miss Bridget had always exprest so great a regard for what the ladies
are pleased to call virtue, and had herself maintained such a severity
of character, that it was expected, especially by Wilkins, that she
would have vented much bitterness on this occasion, and would have
voted for sending the child, as a kind of noxious animal, immediately
out of the house; but, on the contrary, she rather took the
good-natured side of the question, intimated some compassion for the
helpless little creature, and commended her brother's charity in what
he had done.

Perhaps the reader may account for this behaviour from her
condescension to Mr Allworthy, when we have informed him that the good
man had ended his narrative with owning a resolution to take care of
the child, and to breed him up as his own; for, to acknowledge the
truth, she was always ready to oblige her brother, and very seldom, if
ever, contradicted his sentiments. She would, indeed, sometimes make a
few observations, as that men were headstrong, and must have their own
way, and would wish she had been blest with an independent fortune;
but these were always vented in a low voice, and at the most amounted
only to what is called muttering.

However, what she withheld from the infant, she bestowed with the
utmost profuseness on the poor unknown mother, whom she called an
impudent slut, a wanton hussy, an audacious harlot, a wicked jade, a
vile strumpet, with every other appellation with which the tongue of
virtue never fails to lash those who bring a disgrace on the sex.

A consultation was now entered into how to proceed in order to
discover the mother. A scrutiny was first made into the characters of
the female servants of the house, who were all acquitted by Mrs
Wilkins, and with apparent merit; for she had collected them herself,
and perhaps it would be difficult to find such another set of
scarecrows.

The next step was to examine among the inhabitants of the parish; and
this was referred to Mrs Wilkins, who was to enquire with all
imaginable diligence, and to make her report in the afternoon.

Matters being thus settled, Mr Allworthy withdrew to his study, as was
his custom, and left the child to his sister, who, at his desire, had
undertaken the care of it.



Chapter v.

Containing a few common matters, with a very uncommon observation upon
them.


When her master was departed, Mrs Deborah stood silent, expecting her
cue from Miss Bridget; for as to what had past before her master, the
prudent housekeeper by no means relied upon it, as she had often known
the sentiments of the lady in her brother's absence to differ greatly
from those which she had expressed in his presence. Miss Bridget did
not, however, suffer her to continue long in this doubtful situation;
for having looked some time earnestly at the child, as it lay asleep
in the lap of Mrs Deborah, the good lady could not forbear giving it a
hearty kiss, at the same time declaring herself wonderfully pleased
with its beauty and innocence. Mrs Deborah no sooner observed this
than she fell to squeezing and kissing, with as great raptures as
sometimes inspire the sage dame of forty and five towards a youthful
and vigorous bridegroom, crying out, in a shrill voice, "O, the dear
little creature!--The dear, sweet, pretty creature! Well, I vow it is
as fine a boy as ever was seen!"

These exclamations continued till they were interrupted by the lady,
who now proceeded to execute the commission given her by her brother,
and gave orders for providing all necessaries for the child,
appointing a very good room in the house for his nursery. Her orders
were indeed so liberal, that, had it been a child of her own, she
could not have exceeded them; but, lest the virtuous reader may
condemn her for showing too great regard to a base-born infant, to
which all charity is condemned by law as irreligious, we think proper
to observe that she concluded the whole with saying, "Since it was her
brother's whim to adopt the little brat, she supposed little master
must be treated with great tenderness. For her part, she could not
help thinking it was an encouragement to vice; but that she knew too
much of the obstinacy of mankind to oppose any of their ridiculous
humours."

With reflections of this nature she usually, as has been hinted,
accompanied every act of compliance with her brother's inclinations;
and surely nothing could more contribute to heighten the merit of this
compliance than a declaration that she knew, at the same time, the
folly and unreasonableness of those inclinations to which she
submitted. Tacit obedience implies no force upon the will, and
consequently may be easily, and without any pains, preserved; but when
a wife, a child, a relation, or a friend, performs what we desire,
with grumbling and reluctance, with expressions of dislike and
dissatisfaction, the manifest difficulty which they undergo must
greatly enhance the obligation.

As this is one of those deep observations which very few readers can
be supposed capable of making themselves, I have thought proper to
lend them my assistance; but this is a favour rarely to be expected in
the course of my work. Indeed, I shall seldom or never so indulge him,
unless in such instances as this, where nothing but the inspiration
with which we writers are gifted, can possibly enable any one to make
the discovery.



Chapter vi.

Mrs Deborah is introduced into the parish with a simile. A short
account of Jenny Jones, with the difficulties and discouragements
which may attend young women in the pursuit of learning.


Mrs Deborah, having disposed of the child according to the will of her
master, now prepared to visit those habitations which were supposed to
conceal its mother.

Not otherwise than when a kite, tremendous bird, is beheld by the
feathered generation soaring aloft, and hovering over their heads, the
amorous dove, and every innocent little bird, spread wide the alarm,
and fly trembling to their hiding-places. He proudly beats the air,
conscious of his dignity, and meditates intended mischief.

So when the approach of Mrs Deborah was proclaimed through the street,
all the inhabitants ran trembling into their houses, each matron
dreading lest the visit should fall to her lot. She with stately steps
proudly advances over the field: aloft she bears her towering head,
filled with conceit of her own pre-eminence, and schemes to effect her
intended discovery.

The sagacious reader will not from this simile imagine these poor
people had any apprehension of the design with which Mrs Wilkins was
now coming towards them; but as the great beauty of the simile may
possibly sleep these hundred years, till some future commentator shall
take this work in hand, I think proper to lend the reader a little
assistance in this place.

It is my intention, therefore, to signify, that, as it is the nature
of a kite to devour little birds, so is it the nature of such persons
as Mrs Wilkins to insult and tyrannize over little people. This being
indeed the means which they use to recompense to themselves their
extreme servility and condescension to their superiors; for nothing
can be more reasonable, than that slaves and flatterers should exact
the same taxes on all below them, which they themselves pay to all
above them.

Whenever Mrs Deborah had occasion to exert any extraordinary
condescension to Mrs Bridget, and by that means had a little soured
her natural disposition, it was usual with her to walk forth among
these people, in order to refine her temper, by venting, and, as it
were, purging off all ill humours; on which account she was by no
means a welcome visitant: to say the truth, she was universally
dreaded and hated by them all.

On her arrival in this place, she went immediately to the habitation
of an elderly matron; to whom, as this matron had the good fortune to
resemble herself in the comeliness of her person, as well as in her
age, she had generally been more favourable than to any of the rest.
To this woman she imparted what had happened, and the design upon
which she was come thither that morning. These two began presently to
scrutinize the characters of the several young girls who lived in any
of those houses, and at last fixed their strongest suspicion on one
Jenny Jones, who, they both agreed, was the likeliest person to have
committed this fact.

This Jenny Jones was no very comely girl, either in her face or
person; but nature had somewhat compensated the want of beauty with
what is generally more esteemed by those ladies whose judgment is
arrived at years of perfect maturity, for she had given her a very
uncommon share of understanding. This gift Jenny had a good deal
improved by erudition. She had lived several years a servant with a
schoolmaster, who, discovering a great quickness of parts in the girl,
and an extraordinary desire of learning--for every leisure hour she
was always found reading in the books of the scholars--had the
good-nature, or folly--just as the reader pleases to call it--to
instruct her so far, that she obtained a competent skill in the Latin
language, and was, perhaps, as good a scholar as most of the young men
of quality of the age. This advantage, however, like most others of an
extraordinary kind, was attended with some small inconveniences: for
as it is not to be wondered at, that a young woman so well
accomplished should have little relish for the society of those whom
fortune had made her equals, but whom education had rendered so much
her inferiors; so is it matter of no greater astonishment, that this
superiority in Jenny, together with that behaviour which is its
certain consequence, should produce among the rest some little envy
and ill-will towards her; and these had, perhaps, secretly burnt in
the bosoms of her neighbours ever since her return from her service.

Their envy did not, however, display itself openly, till poor Jenny,
to the surprize of everybody, and to the vexation of all the young
women in these parts, had publickly shone forth on a Sunday in a new
silk gown, with a laced cap, and other proper appendages to these.

The flame, which had before lain in embryo, now burst forth. Jenny
had, by her learning, increased her own pride, which none of her
neighbours were kind enough to feed with the honour she seemed to
demand; and now, instead of respect and adoration, she gained nothing
but hatred and abuse by her finery. The whole parish declared she
could not come honestly by such things; and parents, instead of
wishing their daughters the same, felicitated themselves that their
children had them not.

Hence, perhaps, it was, that the good woman first mentioned the name
of this poor girl to Mrs Wilkins; but there was another circumstance
that confirmed the latter in her suspicion; for Jenny had lately been
often at Mr Allworthy's house. She had officiated as nurse to Miss
Bridget, in a violent fit of illness, and had sat up many nights with
that lady; besides which, she had been seen there the very day before
Mr Allworthy's return, by Mrs Wilkins herself, though that sagacious
person had not at first conceived any suspicion of her on that
account: for, as she herself said, "She had always esteemed Jenny as a
very sober girl (though indeed she knew very little of her), and had
rather suspected some of those wanton trollops, who gave themselves
airs, because, forsooth, they thought themselves handsome."

Jenny was now summoned to appear in person before Mrs Deborah, which
she immediately did. When Mrs Deborah, putting on the gravity of a
judge, with somewhat more than his austerity, began an oration with
the words, "You audacious strumpet!" in which she proceeded rather to
pass sentence on the prisoner than to accuse her.

Though Mrs Deborah was fully satisfied of the guilt of Jenny, from the
reasons above shewn, it is possible Mr Allworthy might have required
some stronger evidence to have convicted her; but she saved her
accusers any such trouble, by freely confessing the whole fact with
which she was charged.

This confession, though delivered rather in terms of contrition, as it
appeared, did not at all mollify Mrs Deborah, who now pronounced a
second judgment against her, in more opprobrious language than before;
nor had it any better success with the bystanders, who were now grown
very numerous. Many of them cried out, "They thought what madam's silk
gown would end in;" others spoke sarcastically of her learning. Not a
single female was present but found some means of expressing her
abhorrence of poor Jenny, who bore all very patiently, except the
malice of one woman, who reflected upon her person, and tossing up her
nose, said, "The man must have a good stomach who would give silk
gowns for such sort of trumpery!" Jenny replied to this with a
bitterness which might have surprized a judicious person, who had
observed the tranquillity with which she bore all the affronts to her
chastity; but her patience was perhaps tired out, for this is a virtue
which is very apt to be fatigued by exercise.

Mrs Deborah having succeeded beyond her hopes in her inquiry, returned
with much triumph, and, at the appointed hour, made a faithful report
to Mr Allworthy, who was much surprized at the relation; for he had
heard of the extraordinary parts and improvements of this girl, whom
he intended to have given in marriage, together with a small living,
to a neighbouring curate. His concern, therefore, on this occasion,
was at least equal to the satisfaction which appeared in Mrs Deborah,
and to many readers may seem much more reasonable.

Miss Bridget blessed herself, and said, "For her part, she should
never hereafter entertain a good opinion of any woman." For Jenny
before this had the happiness of being much in her good graces also.

The prudent housekeeper was again dispatched to bring the unhappy
culprit before Mr Allworthy, in order, not as it was hoped by some,
and expected by all, to be sent to the house of correction, but to
receive wholesome admonition and reproof; which those who relish that
kind of instructive writing may peruse in the next chapter.



Chapter vii.

Containing such grave matter, that the reader cannot laugh once
through the whole chapter, unless peradventure he should laugh at the
author.


When Jenny appeared, Mr Allworthy took her into his study, and spoke
to her as follows: "You know, child, it is in my power as a
magistrate, to punish you very rigorously for what you have done; and
you will, perhaps, be the more apt to fear I should execute that
power, because you have in a manner laid your sins at my door.

"But, perhaps, this is one reason which hath determined me to act in a
milder manner with you: for, as no private resentment should ever
influence a magistrate, I will be so far from considering your having
deposited the infant in my house as an aggravation of your offence,
that I will suppose, in your favour, this to have proceeded from a
natural affection to your child, since you might have some hopes to
see it thus better provided for than was in the power of yourself, or
its wicked father, to provide for it. I should indeed have been highly
offended with you had you exposed the little wretch in the manner of
some inhuman mothers, who seem no less to have abandoned their
humanity, than to have parted with their chastity. It is the other
part of your offence, therefore, upon which I intend to admonish you,
I mean the violation of your chastity;--a crime, however lightly it
may be treated by debauched persons, very heinous in itself, and very
dreadful in its consequences.

"The heinous nature of this offence must be sufficiently apparent to
every Christian, inasmuch as it is committed in defiance of the laws
of our religion, and of the express commands of Him who founded that
religion.

"And here its consequences may well be argued to be dreadful; for what
can be more so, than to incur the divine displeasure, by the breach of
the divine commands; and that in an instance against which the highest
vengeance is specifically denounced?

"But these things, though too little, I am afraid, regarded, are so
plain, that mankind, however they may want to be reminded, can never
need information on this head. A hint, therefore, to awaken your sense
of this matter, shall suffice; for I would inspire you with
repentance, and not drive you to desperation.

"There are other consequences, not indeed so dreadful or replete with
horror as this; and yet such, as, if attentively considered, must, one
would think, deter all of your sex at least from the commission of
this crime.

"For by it you are rendered infamous, and driven, like lepers of old,
out of society; at least, from the society of all but wicked and
reprobate persons; for no others will associate with you.

"If you have fortunes, you are hereby rendered incapable of enjoying
them; if you have none, you are disabled from acquiring any, nay
almost of procuring your sustenance; for no persons of character will
receive you into their houses. Thus you are often driven by necessity
itself into a state of shame and misery, which unavoidably ends in the
destruction of both body and soul.

"Can any pleasure compensate these evils? Can any temptation have
sophistry and delusion strong enough to persuade you to so simple a
bargain? Or can any carnal appetite so overpower your reason, or so
totally lay it asleep, as to prevent your flying with affright and
terror from a crime which carries such punishment always with it?

"How base and mean must that woman be, how void of that dignity of
mind, and decent pride, without which we are not worthy the name of
human creatures, who can bear to level herself with the lowest animal,
and to sacrifice all that is great and noble in her, all her heavenly
part, to an appetite which she hath in common with the vilest branch
of the creation! For no woman, sure, will plead the passion of love
for an excuse. This would be to own herself the mere tool and bubble
of the man. Love, however barbarously we may corrupt and pervert its
meaning, as it is a laudable, is a rational passion, and can never be
violent but when reciprocal; for though the Scripture bids us love our
enemies, it means not with that fervent love which we naturally bear
towards our friends; much less that we should sacrifice to them our
lives, and what ought to be dearer to us, our innocence. Now in what
light, but that of an enemy, can a reasonable woman regard the man who
solicits her to entail on herself all the misery I have described to
you, and who would purchase to himself a short, trivial, contemptible
pleasure, so greatly at her expense! For, by the laws of custom, the
whole shame, with all its dreadful consequences, falls intirely upon
her. Can love, which always seeks the good of its object, attempt to
betray a woman into a bargain where she is so greatly to be the loser?
If such corrupter, therefore, should have the impudence to pretend a
real affection for her, ought not the woman to regard him not only as
an enemy, but as the worst of all enemies, a false, designing,
treacherous, pretended friend, who intends not only to debauch her
body, but her understanding at the same time?"

Here Jenny expressing great concern, Allworthy paused a moment, and
then proceeded: "I have talked thus to you, child, not to insult you
for what is past and irrevocable, but to caution and strengthen you
for the future. Nor should I have taken this trouble, but from some
opinion of your good sense, notwithstanding the dreadful slip you have
made; and from some hopes of your hearty repentance, which are founded
on the openness and sincerity of your confession. If these do not
deceive me, I will take care to convey you from this scene of your
shame, where you shall, by being unknown, avoid the punishment which,
as I have said, is allotted to your crime in this world; and I hope,
by repentance, you will avoid the much heavier sentence denounced
against it in the other. Be a good girl the rest of your days, and
want shall be no motive to your going astray; and, believe me, there
is more pleasure, even in this world, in an innocent and virtuous
life, than in one debauched and vicious.

"As to your child, let no thoughts concerning it molest you; I will
provide for it in a better manner than you can ever hope. And now
nothing remains but that you inform me who was the wicked man that
seduced you; for my anger against him will be much greater than you
have experienced on this occasion."

Jenny now lifted her eyes from the ground, and with a modest look and
decent voice thus began:--

"To know you, sir, and not love your goodness, would be an argument of
total want of sense or goodness in any one. In me it would amount to
the highest ingratitude, not to feel, in the most sensible manner, the
great degree of goodness you have been pleased to exert on this
occasion. As to my concern for what is past, I know you will spare my
blushes the repetition. My future conduct will much better declare my
sentiments than any professions I can now make. I beg leave to assure
you, sir, that I take your advice much kinder than your generous offer
with which you concluded it; for, as you are pleased to say, sir, it
is an instance of your opinion of my understanding."--Here her tears
flowing apace, she stopped a few moments, and then proceeded
thus:--"Indeed, sir, your kindness overcomes me; but I will endeavour
to deserve this good opinion: for if I have the understanding you are
so kindly pleased to allow me, such advice cannot be thrown away upon
me. I thank you, sir, heartily, for your intended kindness to my poor
helpless child: he is innocent, and I hope will live to be grateful
for all the favours you shall show him. But now, sir, I must on my
knees entreat you not to persist in asking me to declare the father of
my infant. I promise you faithfully you shall one day know; but I am
under the most solemn ties and engagements of honour, as well as the
most religious vows and protestations, to conceal his name at this
time. And I know you too well, to think you would desire I should
sacrifice either my honour or my religion."

Mr Allworthy, whom the least mention of those sacred words was
sufficient to stagger, hesitated a moment before he replied, and then
told her, she had done wrong to enter into such engagements to a
villain; but since she had, he could not insist on her breaking them.
He said, it was not from a motive of vain curiosity he had inquired,
but in order to punish the fellow; at least, that he might not
ignorantly confer favours on the undeserving.

As to these points, Jenny satisfied him by the most solemn assurances,
that the man was entirely out of his reach; and was neither subject to
his power, nor in any probability of becoming an object of his
goodness.

The ingenuity of this behaviour had gained Jenny so much credit with
this worthy man, that he easily believed what she told him; for as she
had disdained to excuse herself by a lie, and had hazarded his further
displeasure in her present situation, rather than she would forfeit
her honour or integrity by betraying another, he had but little
apprehensions that she would be guilty of falsehood towards himself.

He therefore dismissed her with assurances that he would very soon
remove her out of the reach of that obloquy she had incurred;
concluding with some additional documents, in which he recommended
repentance, saying, "Consider, child, there is one still to reconcile
yourself to, whose favour is of much greater importance to you than
mine."



Chapter viii.

A dialogue between Mesdames Bridget and Deborah; containing more
amusement, but less instruction, than the former.


When Mr Allworthy had retired to his study with Jenny Jones, as hath
been seen, Mrs Bridget, with the good housekeeper, had betaken
themselves to a post next adjoining to the said study; whence, through
the conveyance of a keyhole, they sucked in at their ears the
instructive lecture delivered by Mr Allworthy, together with the
answers of Jenny, and indeed every other particular which passed in
the last chapter.

This hole in her brother's study-door was indeed as well known to Mrs
Bridget, and had been as frequently applied to by her, as the famous
hole in the wall was by Thisbe of old. This served to many good
purposes. For by such means Mrs Bridget became often acquainted with
her brother's inclinations, without giving him the trouble of
repeating them to her. It is true, some inconveniences attended this
intercourse, and she had sometimes reason to cry out with Thisbe, in
Shakspeare, "O, wicked, wicked wall!" For as Mr Allworthy was a
justice of peace, certain things occurred in examinations concerning
bastards, and such like, which are apt to give great offence to the
chaste ears of virgins, especially when they approach the age of
forty, as was the case of Mrs Bridget. However, she had, on such
occasions, the advantage of concealing her blushes from the eyes of
men; and _De non apparentibus, et non existentibus eadem est
ratio_--in English, "When a woman is not seen to blush, she doth not
blush at all."

Both the good women kept strict silence during the whole scene between
Mr Allworthy and the girl; but as soon as it was ended, and that
gentleman was out of hearing, Mrs Deborah could not help exclaiming
against the clemency of her master, and especially against his
suffering her to conceal the father of the child, which she swore she
would have out of her before the sun set.

At these words Mrs Bridget discomposed her features with a smile (a
thing very unusual to her). Not that I would have my reader imagine,
that this was one of those wanton smiles which Homer would have you
conceive came from Venus, when he calls her the laughter-loving
goddess; nor was it one of those smiles which Lady Seraphina shoots
from the stage-box, and which Venus would quit her immortality to be
able to equal. No, this was rather one of those smiles which might be
supposed to have come from the dimpled cheeks of the august Tisiphone,
or from one of the misses, her sisters.

With such a smile then, and with a voice sweet as the evening breeze
of Boreas in the pleasant month of November, Mrs Bridget gently
reproved the curiosity of Mrs Deborah; a vice with which it seems the
latter was too much tainted, and which the former inveighed against
with great bitterness, adding, "That, among all her faults, she
thanked Heaven her enemies could not accuse her of prying into the
affairs of other people."

She then proceeded to commend the honour and spirit with which Jenny
had acted. She said, she could not help agreeing with her brother,
that there was some merit in the sincerity of her confession, and in
her integrity to her lover: that she had always thought her a very
good girl, and doubted not but she had been seduced by some rascal,
who had been infinitely more to blame than herself, and very probably
had prevailed with her by a promise of marriage, or some other
treacherous proceeding.

This behaviour of Mrs Bridget greatly surprised Mrs Deborah; for this
well-bred woman seldom opened her lips, either to her master or his
sister, till she had first sounded their inclinations, with which her
sentiments were always consonant. Here, however, she thought she might
have launched forth with safety; and the sagacious reader will not
perhaps accuse her of want of sufficient forecast in so doing, but
will rather admire with what wonderful celerity she tacked about, when
she found herself steering a wrong course.

"Nay, madam," said this able woman, and truly great politician, "I
must own I cannot help admiring the girl's spirit, as well as your
ladyship. And, as your ladyship says, if she was deceived by some
wicked man, the poor wretch is to be pitied. And to be sure, as your
ladyship says, the girl hath always appeared like a good, honest,
plain girl, and not vain of her face, forsooth, as some wanton husseys
in the neighbourhood are."

"You say true, Deborah," said Miss Bridget. "If the girl had been one
of those vain trollops, of which we have too many in the parish, I
should have condemned my brother for his lenity towards her. I saw two
farmers' daughters at church, the other day, with bare necks. I
protest they shocked me. If wenches will hang out lures for fellows,
it is no matter what they suffer. I detest such creatures; and it
would be much better for them that their faces had been seamed with
the smallpox; but I must confess, I never saw any of this wanton
behaviour in poor Jenny: some artful villain, I am convinced, hath
betrayed, nay perhaps forced her; and I pity the poor wretch with all
my heart."

Mrs Deborah approved all these sentiments, and the dialogue concluded
with a general and bitter invective against beauty, and with many
compassionate considerations for all honest plain girls who are
deluded by the wicked arts of deceitful men.



Chapter ix.

Containing matters which will surprize the reader.


Jenny returned home well pleased with the reception she had met with
from Mr Allworthy, whose indulgence to her she industriously made
public; partly perhaps as a sacrifice to her own pride, and partly
from the more prudent motive of reconciling her neighbours to her, and
silencing their clamours.

But though this latter view, if she indeed had it, may appear
reasonable enough, yet the event did not answer her expectation; for
when she was convened before the justice, and it was universally
apprehended that the house of correction would have been her fate,
though some of the young women cryed out "It was good enough for her,"
and diverted themselves with the thoughts of her beating hemp in a
silk gown; yet there were many others who began to pity her condition:
but when it was known in what manner Mr Allworthy had behaved, the
tide turned against her. One said, "I'll assure you, madam hath had
good luck." A second cryed, "See what it is to be a favourite!" A
third, "Ay, this comes of her learning." Every person made some
malicious comment or other on the occasion, and reflected on the
partiality of the justice.

The behaviour of these people may appear impolitic and ungrateful to
the reader, who considers the power and benevolence of Mr Allworthy.
But as to his power, he never used it; and as to his benevolence, he
exerted so much, that he had thereby disobliged all his neighbours;
for it is a secret well known to great men, that, by conferring an
obligation, they do not always procure a friend, but are certain of
creating many enemies.

Jenny was, however, by the care and goodness of Mr Allworthy, soon
removed out of the reach of reproach; when malice being no longer able
to vent its rage on her, began to seek another object of its
bitterness, and this was no less than Mr Allworthy, himself; for a
whisper soon went abroad, that he himself was the father of the
foundling child.

This supposition so well reconciled his conduct to the general
opinion, that it met with universal assent; and the outcry against his
lenity soon began to take another turn, and was changed into an
invective against his cruelty to the poor girl. Very grave and good
women exclaimed against men who begot children, and then disowned
them. Nor were there wanting some, who, after the departure of Jenny,
insinuated that she was spirited away with a design too black to be
mentioned, and who gave frequent hints that a legal inquiry ought to
be made into the whole matter, and that some people should be forced
to produce the girl.

These calumnies might have probably produced ill consequences, at the
least might have occasioned some trouble, to a person of a more
doubtful and suspicious character than Mr Allworthy was blessed with;
but in his case they had no such effect; and, being heartily despised
by him, they served only to afford an innocent amusement to the good
gossips of the neighbourhood.

But as we cannot possibly divine what complection our reader may be
of, and as it will be some time before he will hear any more of Jenny,
we think proper to give him a very early intimation, that Mr Allworthy
was, and will hereafter appear to be, absolutely innocent of any
criminal intention whatever. He had indeed committed no other than an
error in politics, by tempering justice with mercy, and by refusing to
gratify the good-natured disposition of the mob,[*] with an object for
their compassion to work on in the person of poor Jenny, whom, in
order to pity, they desired to have seen sacrificed to ruin and
infamy, by a shameful correction in Bridewell.

  [*]Whenever this word occurs in our writings, it intends persons
  without virtue or sense, in all stations; and many of the highest
  rank are often meant by it.

So far from complying with this their inclination, by which all hopes
of reformation would have been abolished, and even the gate shut
against her if her own inclinations should ever hereafter lead her to
chuse the road of virtue, Mr Allworthy rather chose to encourage the
girl to return thither by the only possible means; for too true I am
afraid it is, that many women have become abandoned, and have sunk to
the last degree of vice, by being unable to retrieve the first slip.
This will be, I am afraid, always the case while they remain among
their former acquaintance; it was therefore wisely done by Mr
Allworthy, to remove Jenny to a place where she might enjoy the
pleasure of reputation, after having tasted the ill consequences of
losing it.

To this place therefore, wherever it was, we will wish her a good
journey, and for the present take leave of her, and of the little
foundling her child, having matters of much higher importance to
communicate to the reader.



Chapter x.

The hospitality of Allworthy; with a short sketch of the characters of
two brothers, a doctor and a captain, who were entertained by that
gentleman.


Neither Mr Allworthy's house, nor his heart, were shut against any
part of mankind, but they were both more particularly open to men of
merit. To say the truth, this was the only house in the kingdom where
you was sure to gain a dinner by deserving it.

Above all others, men of genius and learning shared the principal
place in his favour; and in these he had much discernment: for though
he had missed the advantage of a learned education, yet, being blest
with vast natural abilities, he had so well profited by a vigorous
though late application to letters, and by much conversation with men
of eminence in this way, that he was himself a very competent judge in
most kinds of literature.

It is no wonder that in an age when this kind of merit is so little in
fashion, and so slenderly provided for, persons possessed of it should
very eagerly flock to a place where they were sure of being received
with great complaisance; indeed, where they might enjoy almost the
same advantages of a liberal fortune as if they were entitled to it in
their own right; for Mr Allworthy was not one of those generous
persons who are ready most bountifully to bestow meat, drink, and
lodging on men of wit and learning, for which they expect no other
return but entertainment, instruction, flattery, and subserviency; in
a word, that such persons should be enrolled in the number of
domestics, without wearing their master's cloathes, or receiving
wages.

On the contrary, every person in this house was perfect master of his
own time: and as he might at his pleasure satisfy all his appetites
within the restrictions only of law, virtue, and religion; so he
might, if his health required, or his inclination prompted him to
temperance, or even to abstinence, absent himself from any meals, or
retire from them, whenever he was so disposed, without even a
sollicitation to the contrary: for, indeed, such sollicitations from
superiors always savour very strongly of commands. But all here were
free from such impertinence, not only those whose company is in all
other places esteemed a favour from their equality of fortune, but
even those whose indigent circumstances make such an eleemosynary
abode convenient to them, and who are therefore less welcome to a
great man's table because they stand in need of it.

Among others of this kind was Dr Blifil, a gentleman who had the
misfortune of losing the advantage of great talents by the obstinacy
of a father, who would breed him to a profession he disliked. In
obedience to this obstinacy the doctor had in his youth been obliged
to study physic, or rather to say he studied it; for in reality books
of this kind were almost the only ones with which he was unacquainted;
and unfortunately for him, the doctor was master of almost every other
science but that by which he was to get his bread; the consequence of
which was, that the doctor at the age of forty had no bread to eat.

Such a person as this was certain to find a welcome at Mr Allworthy's
table, to whom misfortunes were ever a recommendation, when they were
derived from the folly or villany of others, and not of the
unfortunate person himself. Besides this negative merit, the doctor
had one positive recommendation;--this was a great appearance of
religion. Whether his religion was real, or consisted only in
appearance, I shall not presume to say, as I am not possessed of any
touchstone which can distinguish the true from the false.

If this part of his character pleased Mr Allworthy, it delighted Miss
Bridget. She engaged him in many religious controversies; on which
occasions she constantly expressed great satisfaction in the doctor's
knowledge, and not much less in the compliments which he frequently
bestowed on her own. To say the truth, she had read much English
divinity, and had puzzled more than one of the neighbouring curates.
Indeed, her conversation was so pure, her looks so sage, and her whole
deportment so grave and solemn, that she seemed to deserve the name of
saint equally with her namesake, or with any other female in the Roman
kalendar.

As sympathies of all kinds are apt to beget love, so experience
teaches us that none have a more direct tendency this way than those
of a religious kind between persons of different sexes. The doctor
found himself so agreeable to Miss Bridget, that he now began to
lament an unfortunate accident which had happened to him about ten
years before; namely, his marriage with another woman, who was not
only still alive, but, what was worse, known to be so by Mr Allworthy.
This was a fatal bar to that happiness which he otherwise saw
sufficient probability of obtaining with this young lady; for as to
criminal indulgences, he certainly never thought of them. This was
owing either to his religion, as is most probable, or to the purity of
his passion, which was fixed on those things which matrimony only, and
not criminal correspondence, could put him in possession of, or could
give him any title to.

He had not long ruminated on these matters, before it occurred to his
memory that he had a brother who was under no such unhappy incapacity.
This brother he made no doubt would succeed; for he discerned, as he
thought, an inclination to marriage in the lady; and the reader
perhaps, when he hears the brother's qualifications, will not blame
the confidence which he entertained of his success.

This gentleman was about thirty-five years of age. He was of a middle
size, and what is called well-built. He had a scar on his forehead,
which did not so much injure his beauty as it denoted his valour (for
he was a half-pay officer). He had good teeth, and something affable,
when he pleased, in his smile; though naturally his countenance, as
well as his air and voice, had much of roughness in it: yet he could
at any time deposit this, and appear all gentleness and good-humour.
He was not ungenteel, nor entirely devoid of wit, and in his youth had
abounded in sprightliness, which, though he had lately put on a more
serious character, he could, when he pleased, resume.

He had, as well as the doctor, an academic education; for his father
had, with the same paternal authority we have mentioned before,
decreed him for holy orders; but as the old gentleman died before he
was ordained, he chose the church military, and preferred the king's
commission to the bishop's.

He had purchased the post of lieutenant of dragoons, and afterwards
came to be a captain; but having quarrelled with his colonel, was by
his interest obliged to sell; from which time he had entirely
rusticated himself, had betaken himself to studying the Scriptures,
and was not a little suspected of an inclination to methodism.

It seemed, therefore, not unlikely that such a person should succeed
with a lady of so saint-like a disposition, and whose inclinations
were no otherwise engaged than to the marriage state in general; but
why the doctor, who certainly had no great friendship for his brother,
should for his sake think of making so ill a return to the hospitality
of Allworthy, is a matter not so easy to be accounted for.

Is it that some natures delight in evil, as others are thought to
delight in virtue? Or is there a pleasure in being accessory to a
theft when we cannot commit it ourselves? Or lastly (which experience
seems to make probable), have we a satisfaction in aggrandizing our
families, even though we have not the least love or respect for them?

Whether any of these motives operated on the doctor, we will not
determine; but so the fact was. He sent for his brother, and easily
found means to introduce him at Allworthy's as a person who intended
only a short visit to himself.

The captain had not been in the house a week before the doctor had
reason to felicitate himself on his discernment. The captain was
indeed as great a master of the art of love as Ovid was formerly. He
had besides received proper hints from his brother, which he failed
not to improve to the best advantage.



Chapter xi.

Containing many rules, and some examples, concerning falling in love:
descriptions of beauty, and other more prudential inducements to
matrimony.


It hath been observed, by wise men or women, I forget which, that all
persons are doomed to be in love once in their lives. No particular
season is, as I remember, assigned for this; but the age at which Miss
Bridget was arrived, seems to me as proper a period as any to be fixed
on for this purpose: it often, indeed, happens much earlier; but when
it doth not, I have observed it seldom or never fails about this time.
Moreover, we may remark that at this season love is of a more serious
and steady nature than what sometimes shows itself in the younger
parts of life. The love of girls is uncertain, capricious, and so
foolish that we cannot always discover what the young lady would be
at; nay, it may almost be doubted whether she always knows this
herself.

Now we are never at a loss to discern this in women about forty; for
as such grave, serious, and experienced ladies well know their own
meaning, so it is always very easy for a man of the least sagacity to
discover it with the utmost certainty.

Miss Bridget is an example of all these observations. She had not been
many times in the captain's company before she was seized with this
passion. Nor did she go pining and moping about the house, like a
puny, foolish girl, ignorant of her distemper: she felt, she knew, and
she enjoyed, the pleasing sensation, of which, as she was certain it
was not only innocent but laudable, she was neither afraid nor
ashamed.

And to say the truth, there is, in all points, great difference
between the reasonable passion which women at this age conceive
towards men, and the idle and childish liking of a girl to a boy,
which is often fixed on the outside only, and on things of little
value and no duration; as on cherry-cheeks, small, lily-white hands,
sloe-black eyes, flowing locks, downy chins, dapper shapes; nay,
sometimes on charms more worthless than these, and less the party's
own; such are the outward ornaments of the person, for which men are
beholden to the taylor, the laceman, the periwig-maker, the hatter,
and the milliner, and not to nature. Such a passion girls may well be
ashamed, as they generally are, to own either to themselves or others.

The love of Miss Bridget was of another kind. The captain owed nothing
to any of these fop-makers in his dress, nor was his person much more
beholden to nature. Both his dress and person were such as, had they
appeared in an assembly or a drawing-room, would have been the
contempt and ridicule of all the fine ladies there. The former of
these was indeed neat, but plain, coarse, ill-fancied, and out of
fashion. As for the latter, we have expressly described it above. So
far was the skin on his cheeks from being cherry-coloured, that you
could not discern what the natural colour of his cheeks was, they
being totally overgrown by a black beard, which ascended to his eyes.
His shape and limbs were indeed exactly proportioned, but so large
that they denoted the strength rather of a ploughman than any other.
His shoulders were broad beyond all size, and the calves of his legs
larger than those of a common chairman. In short, his whole person
wanted all that elegance and beauty which is the very reverse of
clumsy strength, and which so agreeably sets off most of our fine
gentlemen; being partly owing to the high blood of their ancestors,
viz., blood made of rich sauces and generous wines, and partly to an
early town education.

Though Miss Bridget was a woman of the greatest delicacy of taste, yet
such were the charms of the captain's conversation, that she totally
overlooked the defects of his person. She imagined, and perhaps very
wisely, that she should enjoy more agreeable minutes with the captain
than with a much prettier fellow; and forewent the consideration of
pleasing her eyes, in order to procure herself much more solid
satisfaction.

The captain no sooner perceived the passion of Miss Bridget, in which
discovery he was very quick-sighted, than he faithfully returned it.
The lady, no more than her lover, was remarkable for beauty. I would
attempt to draw her picture, but that is done already by a more able
master, Mr Hogarth himself, to whom she sat many years ago, and hath
been lately exhibited by that gentleman in his print of a winter's
morning, of which she was no improper emblem, and may be seen walking
(for walk she doth in the print) to Covent Garden church, with a
starved foot-boy behind carrying her prayer-book.

The captain likewise very wisely preferred the more solid enjoyments
he expected with this lady, to the fleeting charms of person. He was
one of those wise men who regard beauty in the other sex as a very
worthless and superficial qualification; or, to speak more truly, who
rather chuse to possess every convenience of life with an ugly woman,
than a handsome one without any of those conveniences. And having a
very good appetite, and but little nicety, he fancied he should play
his part very well at the matrimonial banquet, without the sauce of
beauty.

To deal plainly with the reader, the captain, ever since his arrival,
at least from the moment his brother had proposed the match to him,
long before he had discovered any flattering symptoms in Miss Bridget,
had been greatly enamoured; that is to say, of Mr Allworthy's house
and gardens, and of his lands, tenements, and hereditaments; of all
which the captain was so passionately fond, that he would most
probably have contracted marriage with them, had he been obliged to
have taken the witch of Endor into the bargain.

As Mr Allworthy, therefore, had declared to the doctor that he never
intended to take a second wife, as his sister was his nearest
relation, and as the doctor had fished out that his intentions were to
make any child of hers his heir, which indeed the law, without his
interposition, would have done for him; the doctor and his brother
thought it an act of benevolence to give being to a human creature,
who would be so plentifully provided with the most essential means of
happiness. The whole thoughts, therefore, of both the brothers were
how to engage the affections of this amiable lady.

But fortune, who is a tender parent, and often doth more for her
favourite offspring than either they deserve or wish, had been so
industrious for the captain, that whilst he was laying schemes to
execute his purpose, the lady conceived the same desires with himself,
and was on her side contriving how to give the captain proper
encouragement, without appearing too forward; for she was a strict
observer of all rules of decorum. In this, however, she easily
succeeded; for as the captain was always on the look-out, no glance,
gesture, or word escaped him.

The satisfaction which the captain received from the kind behaviour of
Miss Bridget, was not a little abated by his apprehensions of Mr
Allworthy; for, notwithstanding his disinterested professions, the
captain imagined he would, when he came to act, follow the example of
the rest of the world, and refuse his consent to a match so
disadvantageous, in point of interest, to his sister. From what oracle
he received this opinion, I shall leave the reader to determine: but
however he came by it, it strangely perplexed him how to regulate his
conduct so as at once to convey his affection to the lady, and to
conceal it from her brother. He at length resolved to take all private
opportunities of making his addresses; but in the presence of Mr
Allworthy to be as reserved and as much upon his guard as was
possible; and this conduct was highly approved by the brother.

He soon found means to make his addresses, in express terms, to his
mistress, from whom he received an answer in the proper form, viz.:
the answer which was first made some thousands of years ago, and which
hath been handed down by tradition from mother to daughter ever since.
If I was to translate this into Latin, I should render it by these two
words, _Nolo Episcopari_: a phrase likewise of immemorial use on
another occasion.

The captain, however he came by his knowledge, perfectly well
understood the lady, and very soon after repeated his application with
more warmth and earnestness than before, and was again, according to
due form, rejected; but as he had increased in the eagerness of his
desires, so the lady, with the same propriety, decreased in the
violence of her refusal.

Not to tire the reader, by leading him through every scene of this
courtship (which, though in the opinion of a certain great author, it
is the pleasantest scene of life to the actor, is, perhaps, as dull
and tiresome as any whatever to the audience), the captain made his
advances in form, the citadel was defended in form, and at length, in
proper form, surrendered at discretion.

During this whole time, which filled the space of near a month, the
captain preserved great distance of behaviour to his lady in the
presence of the brother; and the more he succeeded with her in
private, the more reserved was he in public. And as for the lady, she
had no sooner secured her lover than she behaved to him before company
with the highest degree of indifference; so that Mr Allworthy must
have had the insight of the devil (or perhaps some of his worse
qualities) to have entertained the least suspicion of what was going
forward.



Chapter xii.

Containing what the reader may, perhaps, expect to find in it.


In all bargains, whether to fight or to marry, or concerning any other
such business, little previous ceremony is required to bring the
matter to an issue when both parties are really in earnest. This was
the case at present, and in less than a month the captain and his lady
were man and wife.

The great concern now was to break the matter to Mr Allworthy; and
this was undertaken by the doctor.

One day, then, as Allworthy was walking in his garden, the doctor came
to him, and, with great gravity of aspect, and all the concern which
he could possibly affect in his countenance, said, "I am come, sir, to
impart an affair to you of the utmost consequence; but how shall I
mention to you what it almost distracts me to think of!" He then
launched forth into the most bitter invectives both against men and
women; accusing the former of having no attachment but to their
interest, and the latter of being so addicted to vicious inclinations
that they could never be safely trusted with one of the other sex.
"Could I," said he, "sir, have suspected that a lady of such prudence,
such judgment, such learning, should indulge so indiscreet a passion!
or could I have imagined that my brother--why do I call him so? he is
no longer a brother of mine----"

"Indeed but he is," said Allworthy, "and a brother of mine too."

"Bless me, sir!" said the doctor, "do you know the shocking affair?"

"Look'ee, Mr Blifil," answered the good man, "it hath been my constant
maxim in life to make the best of all matters which happen. My sister,
though many years younger than I, is at least old enough to be at the
age of discretion. Had he imposed on a child, I should have been more
averse to have forgiven him; but a woman upwards of thirty must
certainly be supposed to know what will make her most happy. She hath
married a gentleman, though perhaps not quite her equal in fortune;
and if he hath any perfections in her eye which can make up that
deficiency, I see no reason why I should object to her choice of her
own happiness; which I, no more than herself, imagine to consist only
in immense wealth. I might, perhaps, from the many declarations I have
made of complying with almost any proposal, have expected to have been
consulted on this occasion; but these matters are of a very delicate
nature, and the scruples of modesty, perhaps, are not to be overcome.
As to your brother, I have really no anger against him at all. He hath
no obligations to me, nor do I think he was under any necessity of
asking my consent, since the woman is, as I have said, _sui juris_,
and of a proper age to be entirely answerable only, to herself for her
conduct."

The doctor accused Mr Allworthy of too great lenity, repeated his
accusations against his brother, and declared that he should never
more be brought either to see, or to own him for his relation. He then
launched forth into a panegyric on Allworthy's goodness; into the
highest encomiums on his friendship; and concluded by saying, he
should never forgive his brother for having put the place which he
bore in that friendship to a hazard.

Allworthy thus answered: "Had I conceived any displeasure against your
brother, I should never have carried that resentment to the innocent:
but I assure you I have no such displeasure. Your brother appears to
me to be a man of sense and honour. I do not disapprove the taste of
my sister; nor will I doubt but that she is equally the object of his
inclinations. I have always thought love the only foundation of
happiness in a married state, as it can only produce that high and
tender friendship which should always be the cement of this union;
and, in my opinion, all those marriages which are contracted from
other motives are greatly criminal; they are a profanation of a most
holy ceremony, and generally end in disquiet and misery: for surely we
may call it a profanation to convert this most sacred institution into
a wicked sacrifice to lust or avarice: and what better can be said of
those matches to which men are induced merely by the consideration of
a beautiful person, or a great fortune?

"To deny that beauty is an agreeable object to the eye, and even
worthy some admiration, would be false and foolish. Beautiful is an
epithet often used in Scripture, and always mentioned with honour. It
was my own fortune to marry a woman whom the world thought handsome,
and I can truly say I liked her the better on that account. But to
make this the sole consideration of marriage, to lust after it so
violently as to overlook all imperfections for its sake, or to require
it so absolutely as to reject and disdain religion, virtue, and sense,
which are qualities in their nature of much higher perfection, only
because an elegance of person is wanting: this is surely inconsistent,
either with a wise man or a good Christian. And it is, perhaps, being
too charitable to conclude that such persons mean anything more by
their marriage than to please their carnal appetites; for the
satisfaction of which, we are taught, it was not ordained.

"In the next place, with respect to fortune. Worldly prudence,
perhaps, exacts some consideration on this head; nor will I absolutely
and altogether condemn it. As the world is constituted, the demands of
a married state, and the care of posterity, require some little regard
to what we call circumstances. Yet this provision is greatly
increased, beyond what is really necessary, by folly and vanity, which
create abundantly more wants than nature. Equipage for the wife, and
large fortunes for the children, are by custom enrolled in the list of
necessaries; and to procure these, everything truly solid and sweet,
and virtuous and religious, are neglected and overlooked.

"And this in many degrees; the last and greatest of which seems scarce
distinguishable from madness;--I mean where persons of immense
fortunes contract themselves to those who are, and must be,
disagreeable to them--to fools and knaves--in order to increase an
estate already larger even than the demands of their pleasures. Surely
such persons, if they will not be thought mad, must own, either that
they are incapable of tasting the sweets of the tenderest friendship,
or that they sacrifice the greatest happiness of which they are
capable to the vain, uncertain, and senseless laws of vulgar opinion,
which owe as well their force as their foundation to folly."

Here Allworthy concluded his sermon, to which Blifil had listened with
the profoundest attention, though it cost him some pains to prevent
now and then a small discomposure of his muscles. He now praised every
period of what he had heard with the warmth of a young divine, who
hath the honour to dine with a bishop the same day in which his
lordship hath mounted the pulpit.



Chapter xiii.

Which concludes the first book; with an instance of ingratitude,
which, we hope, will appear unnatural.


The reader, from what hath been said, may imagine that the
reconciliation (if indeed it could be so called) was only matter of
form; we shall therefore pass it over, and hasten to what must surely
be thought matter of substance.

The doctor had acquainted his brother with what had past between Mr
Allworthy and him; and added with a smile, "I promise you I paid you
off; nay, I absolutely desired the good gentleman not to forgive you:
for you know after he had made a declaration in your favour, I might
with safety venture on such a request with a person of his temper; and
I was willing, as well for your sake as for my own, to prevent the
least possibility of a suspicion."

Captain Blifil took not the least notice of this, at that time; but he
afterwards made a very notable use of it.

One of the maxims which the devil, in a late visit upon earth, left to
his disciples, is, when once you are got up, to kick the stool from
under you. In plain English, when you have made your fortune by the
good offices of a friend, you are advised to discard him as soon as
you can.

Whether the captain acted by this maxim, I will not positively
determine: so far we may confidently say, that his actions may be
fairly derived from this diabolical principle; and indeed it is
difficult to assign any other motive to them: for no sooner was he
possessed of Miss Bridget, and reconciled to Allworthy, than he began
to show a coldness to his brother which increased daily; till at
length it grew into rudeness, and became very visible to every one.

The doctor remonstrated to him privately concerning this behaviour,
but could obtain no other satisfaction than the following plain
declaration: "If you dislike anything in my brother's house, sir, you
know you are at liberty to quit it." This strange, cruel, and almost
unaccountable ingratitude in the captain, absolutely broke the poor
doctor's heart; for ingratitude never so thoroughly pierces the human
breast as when it proceeds from those in whose behalf we have been
guilty of transgressions. Reflections on great and good actions,
however they are received or returned by those in whose favour they
are performed, always administer some comfort to us; but what
consolation shall we receive under so biting a calamity as the
ungrateful behaviour of our friend, when our wounded conscience at the
same time flies in our face, and upbraids us with having spotted it in
the service of one so worthless!

Mr Allworthy himself spoke to the captain in his brother's behalf, and
desired to know what offence the doctor had committed; when the
hard-hearted villain had the baseness to say that he should never
forgive him for the injury which he had endeavoured to do him in his
favour; which, he said, he had pumped out of him, and was such a
cruelty that it ought not to be forgiven.

Allworthy spoke in very high terms upon this declaration, which, he
said, became not a human creature. He expressed, indeed, so much
resentment against an unforgiving temper, that the captain at last
pretended to be convinced by his arguments, and outwardly professed to
be reconciled.

As for the bride, she was now in her honeymoon, and so passionately
fond of her new husband that he never appeared to her to be in the
wrong; and his displeasure against any person was a sufficient reason
for her dislike to the same.

The captain, at Mr Allworthy's instance, was outwardly, as we have
said, reconciled to his brother; yet the same rancour remained in his
heart; and he found so many opportunities of giving him private hints
of this, that the house at last grew insupportable to the poor doctor;
and he chose rather to submit to any inconveniences which he might
encounter in the world, than longer to bear these cruel and ungrateful
insults from a brother for whom he had done so much.

He once intended to acquaint Allworthy with the whole; but he could
not bring himself to submit to the confession, by which he must take
to his share so great a portion of guilt. Besides, by how much the
worse man he represented his brother to be, so much the greater would
his own offence appear to Allworthy, and so much the greater, he had
reason to imagine, would be his resentment.

He feigned, therefore, some excuse of business for his departure, and
promised to return soon again; and took leave of his brother with so
well-dissembled content, that, as the captain played his part to the
same perfection, Allworthy remained well satisfied with the truth of
the reconciliation.

The doctor went directly to London, where he died soon after of a
broken heart; a distemper which kills many more than is generally
imagined, and would have a fair title to a place in the bill of
mortality, did it not differ in one instance from all other
diseases--viz., that no physician can cure it.

Now, upon the most diligent enquiry into the former lives of these two
brothers, I find, besides the cursed and hellish maxim of policy above
mentioned, another reason for the captain's conduct: the captain,
besides what we have before said of him, was a man of great pride and
fierceness, and had always treated his brother, who was of a different
complexion, and greatly deficient in both these qualities, with the
utmost air of superiority. The doctor, however, had much the larger
share of learning, and was by many reputed to have the better
understanding. This the captain knew, and could not bear; for though
envy is at best a very malignant passion, yet is its bitterness
greatly heightened by mixing with contempt towards the same object;
and very much afraid I am, that whenever an obligation is joined to
these two, indignation and not gratitude will be the product of all
three.




BOOK II.

CONTAINING SCENES OF MATRIMONIAL FELICITY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF
LIFE; AND VARIOUS OTHER TRANSACTIONS DURING THE FIRST TWO YEARS AFTER
THE MARRIAGE BETWEEN CAPTAIN BLIFIL AND MISS BRIDGET ALLWORTHY.



Chapter i.

Showing what kind of a history this is; what it is like, and what it
is not like.


Though we have properly enough entitled this our work, a history, and
not a life; nor an apology for a life, as is more in fashion; yet we
intend in it rather to pursue the method of those writers, who profess
to disclose the revolutions of countries, than to imitate the painful
and voluminous historian, who, to preserve the regularity of his
series, thinks himself obliged to fill up as much paper with the
detail of months and years in which nothing remarkable happened, as he
employs upon those notable aeras when the greatest scenes have been
transacted on the human stage.

Such histories as these do, in reality, very much resemble a
newspaper, which consists of just the same number of words, whether
there be any news in it or not. They may likewise be compared to a
stage coach, which performs constantly the same course, empty as well
as full. The writer, indeed, seems to think himself obliged to keep
even pace with time, whose amanuensis he is; and, like his master,
travels as slowly through centuries of monkish dulness, when the world
seems to have been asleep, as through that bright and busy age so
nobly distinguished by the excellent Latin poet--

     _Ad confligendum venientibus undique poenis,
     Omnia cum belli trepido concussa tumultu
     Horrida contremuere sub altis aetheris auris;
     In dubioque fuit sub utrorum regna cadendum
     Omnibus humanis esset, terraque marique._

Of which we wish we could give our readers a more adequate translation
than that by Mr Creech--

     When dreadful Carthage frighted Rome with arms,
     And all the world was shook with fierce alarms;
     Whilst undecided yet, which part should fall,
     Which nation rise the glorious lord of all.

Now it is our purpose, in the ensuing pages, to pursue a contrary
method. When any extraordinary scene presents itself (as we trust will
often be the case), we shall spare no pains nor paper to open it at
large to our reader; but if whole years should pass without producing
anything worthy his notice, we shall not be afraid of a chasm in our
history; but shall hasten on to matters of consequence, and leave such
periods of time totally unobserved.

These are indeed to be considered as blanks in the grand lottery of
time. We therefore, who are the registers of that lottery, shall
imitate those sagacious persons who deal in that which is drawn at
Guildhall, and who never trouble the public with the many blanks they
dispose of; but when a great prize happens to be drawn, the newspapers
are presently filled with it, and the world is sure to be informed at
whose office it was sold: indeed, commonly two or three different
offices lay claim to the honour of having disposed of it; by which, I
suppose, the adventurers are given to understand that certain brokers
are in the secrets of Fortune, and indeed of her cabinet council.

My reader then is not to be surprized, if, in the course of this work,
he shall find some chapters very short, and others altogether as long;
some that contain only the time of a single day, and others that
comprise years; in a word, if my history sometimes seems to stand
still, and sometimes to fly. For all which I shall not look on myself
as accountable to any court of critical jurisdiction whatever: for as
I am, in reality, the founder of a new province of writing, so I am at
liberty to make what laws I please therein. And these laws, my
readers, whom I consider as my subjects, are bound to believe in and
to obey; with which that they may readily and cheerfully comply, I do
hereby assure them that I shall principally regard their ease and
advantage in all such institutions: for I do not, like a _jure divino_
tyrant, imagine that they are my slaves, or my commodity. I am,
indeed, set over them for their own good only, and was created for
their use, and not they for mine. Nor do I doubt, while I make their
interest the great rule of my writings, they will unanimously concur
in supporting my dignity, and in rendering me all the honour I shall
deserve or desire.



Chapter ii.

Religious cautions against showing too much favour to bastards; and a
great discovery made by Mrs Deborah Wilkins.


Eight months after the celebration of the nuptials between Captain
Blifil and Miss Bridget Allworthy, a young lady of great beauty,
merit, and fortune, was Miss Bridget, by reason of a fright, delivered
of a fine boy. The child was indeed to all appearances perfect; but
the midwife discovered it was born a month before its full time.

Though the birth of an heir by his beloved sister was a circumstance
of great joy to Mr Allworthy, yet it did not alienate his affections
from the little foundling, to whom he had been godfather, had given
his own name of Thomas, and whom he had hitherto seldom failed of
visiting, at least once a day, in his nursery.

He told his sister, if she pleased, the new-born infant should be bred
up together with little Tommy; to which she consented, though with
some little reluctance: for she had truly a great complacence for her
brother; and hence she had always behaved towards the foundling with
rather more kindness than ladies of rigid virtue can sometimes bring
themselves to show to these children, who, however innocent, may be
truly called the living monuments of incontinence.

The captain could not so easily bring himself to bear what he
condemned as a fault in Mr Allworthy. He gave him frequent hints, that
to adopt the fruits of sin, was to give countenance to it. He quoted
several texts (for he was well read in Scripture), such as, _He visits
the sins of the fathers upon the children; and the fathers have eaten
sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge_,&c. Whence he
argued the legality of punishing the crime of the parent on the
bastard. He said, "Though the law did not positively allow the
destroying such base-born children, yet it held them to be the
children of nobody; that the Church considered them as the children of
nobody; and that at the best, they ought to be brought up to the
lowest and vilest offices of the commonwealth."

Mr Allworthy answered to all this, and much more, which the captain
had urged on this subject, "That, however guilty the parents might be,
the children were certainly innocent: that as to the texts he had
quoted, the former of them was a particular denunciation against the
Jews, for the sin of idolatry, of relinquishing and hating their
heavenly King; and the latter was parabolically spoken, and rather
intended to denote the certain and necessary consequences of sin, than
any express judgment against it. But to represent the Almighty as
avenging the sins of the guilty on the innocent, was indecent, if not
blasphemous, as it was to represent him acting against the first
principles of natural justice, and against the original notions of
right and wrong, which he himself had implanted in our minds; by which
we were to judge not only in all matters which were not revealed, but
even of the truth of revelation itself. He said he knew many held the
same principles with the captain on this head; but he was himself
firmly convinced to the contrary, and would provide in the same manner
for this poor infant, as if a legitimate child had had fortune to have
been found in the same place."

While the captain was taking all opportunities to press these and such
like arguments, to remove the little foundling from Mr Allworthy's, of
whose fondness for him he began to be jealous, Mrs Deborah had made a
discovery, which, in its event, threatened at least to prove more
fatal to poor Tommy than all the reasonings of the captain.

Whether the insatiable curiosity of this good woman had carried her on
to that business, or whether she did it to confirm herself in the good
graces of Mrs Blifil, who, notwithstanding her outward behaviour to
the foundling, frequently abused the infant in private, and her
brother too, for his fondness to it, I will not determine; but she had
now, as she conceived, fully detected the father of the foundling.

Now, as this was a discovery of great consequence, it may be necessary
to trace it from the fountain-head. We shall therefore very minutely
lay open those previous matters by which it was produced; and for that
purpose we shall be obliged to reveal all the secrets of a little
family with which my reader is at present entirely unacquainted; and
of which the oeconomy was so rare and extraordinary, that I fear it
will shock the utmost credulity of many married persons.



Chapter iii.

The description of a domestic government founded upon rules directly
contrary to those of Aristotle.


My reader may please to remember he hath been informed that Jenny
Jones had lived some years with a certain schoolmaster, who had, at
her earnest desire, instructed her in Latin, in which, to do justice
to her genius, she had so improved herself, that she was become a
better scholar than her master.

Indeed, though this poor man had undertaken a profession to which
learning must be allowed necessary, this was the least of his
commendations. He was one of the best-natured fellows in the world,
and was, at the same time, master of so much pleasantry and humour,
that he was reputed the wit of the country; and all the neighbouring
gentlemen were so desirous of his company, that as denying was not his
talent, he spent much time at their houses, which he might, with more
emolument, have spent in his school.

It may be imagined that a gentleman so qualified and so disposed, was
in no danger of becoming formidable to the learned seminaries of Eton
or Westminster. To speak plainly, his scholars were divided into two
classes: in the upper of which was a young gentleman, the son of a
neighbouring squire, who, at the age of seventeen, was just entered
into his Syntaxis; and in the lower was a second son of the same
gentleman, who, together with seven parish-boys, was learning to read
and write.

The stipend arising hence would hardly have indulged the schoolmaster
in the luxuries of life, had he not added to this office those of
clerk and barber, and had not Mr Allworthy added to the whole an
annuity of ten pounds, which the poor man received every Christmas,
and with which he was enabled to cheer his heart during that sacred
festival.

Among his other treasures, the pedagogue had a wife, whom he had
married out of Mr Allworthy's kitchen for her fortune, viz., twenty
pounds, which she had there amassed.

This woman was not very amiable in her person. Whether she sat to my
friend Hogarth, or no, I will not determine; but she exactly resembled
the young woman who is pouring out her mistress's tea in the third
picture of the Harlot's Progress. She was, besides, a profest follower
of that noble sect founded by Xantippe of old; by means of which she
became more formidable in the school than her husband; for, to confess
the truth, he was never master there, or anywhere else, in her
presence.

Though her countenance did not denote much natural sweetness of
temper, yet this was, perhaps, somewhat soured by a circumstance which
generally poisons matrimonial felicity; for children are rightly
called the pledges of love; and her husband, though they had been
married nine years, had given her no such pledges; a default for which
he had no excuse, either from age or health, being not yet thirty
years old, and what they call a jolly brisk young man.

Hence arose another evil, which produced no little uneasiness to the
poor pedagogue, of whom she maintained so constant a jealousy, that he
durst hardly speak to one woman in the parish; for the least degree of
civility, or even correspondence, with any female, was sure to bring
his wife upon her back, and his own.

In order to guard herself against matrimonial injuries in her own
house, as she kept one maid-servant, she always took care to chuse her
out of that order of females whose faces are taken as a kind of
security for their virtue; of which number Jenny Jones, as the reader
hath been before informed, was one.

As the face of this young woman might be called pretty good security
of the before-mentioned kind, and as her behaviour had been always
extremely modest, which is the certain consequence of understanding in
women; she had passed above four years at Mr Partridge's (for that was
the schoolmaster's name) without creating the least suspicion in her
mistress. Nay, she had been treated with uncommon kindness, and her
mistress had permitted Mr Partridge to give her those instructions
which have been before commemorated.

But it is with jealousy as with the gout: when such distempers are in
the blood, there is never any security against their breaking out; and
that often on the slightest occasions, and when least suspected.

Thus it happened to Mrs Partridge, who had submitted four years to her
husband's teaching this young woman, and had suffered her often to
neglect her work, in order to pursue her learning. For, passing by one
day, as the girl was reading, and her master leaning over her, the
girl, I know not for what reason, suddenly started up from her chair:
and this was the first time that suspicion ever entered into the head
of her mistress. This did not, however, at that time discover itself,
but lay lurking in her mind, like a concealed enemy, who waits for a
reinforcement of additional strength before he openly declares himself
and proceeds upon hostile operations: and such additional strength
soon arrived to corroborate her suspicion; for not long after, the
husband and wife being at dinner, the master said to his maid, _Da
mihi aliquid potum:_ upon which the poor girl smiled, perhaps at the
badness of the Latin, and, when her mistress cast her eyes on her,
blushed, possibly with a consciousness of having laughed at her
master. Mrs Partridge, upon this, immediately fell into a fury, and
discharged the trencher on which she was eating, at the head of poor
Jenny, crying out, "You impudent whore, do you play tricks with my
husband before my face?" and at the same instant rose from her chair
with a knife in her hand, with which, most probably, she would have
executed very tragical vengeance, had not the girl taken the advantage
of being nearer the door than her mistress, and avoided her fury by
running away: for, as to the poor husband, whether surprize had
rendered him motionless, or fear (which is full as probable) had
restrained him from venturing at any opposition, he sat staring and
trembling in his chair; nor did he once offer to move or speak, till
his wife, returning from the pursuit of Jenny, made some defensive
measures necessary for his own preservation; and he likewise was
obliged to retreat, after the example of the maid.

This good woman was, no more than Othello, of a disposition

            To make a life of jealousy
     And follow still the changes of the moon
     With fresh suspicions--

With her, as well as him,

          --To be once in doubt,
     Was once to be resolvd--

she therefore ordered Jenny immediately to pack up her alls and
begone, for that she was determined she should not sleep that night
within her walls.

Mr Partridge had profited too much by experience to interpose in a
matter of this nature. He therefore had recourse to his usual receipt
of patience, for, though he was not a great adept in Latin, he
remembered, and well understood, the advice contained in these words

     --_Leve fit quod bene fertur onus_

in English:

     A burden becomes lightest when it is well borne--

which he had always in his mouth; and of which, to say the truth, he
had often occasion to experience the truth.

Jenny offered to make protestations of her innocence; but the tempest
was too strong for her to be heard. She then betook herself to the
business of packing, for which a small quantity of brown paper
sufficed, and, having received her small pittance of wages, she
returned home.

The schoolmaster and his consort passed their time unpleasantly enough
that evening, but something or other happened before the next morning,
which a little abated the fury of Mrs Partridge; and she at length
admitted her husband to make his excuses: to which she gave the
readier belief, as he had, instead of desiring her to recall Jenny,
professed a satisfaction in her being dismissed, saying, she was grown
of little use as a servant, spending all her time in reading, and was
become, moreover, very pert and obstinate; for, indeed, she and her
master had lately had frequent disputes in literature; in which, as
hath been said, she was become greatly his superior. This, however, he
would by no means allow; and as he called her persisting in the right,
obstinacy, he began to hate her with no small inveteracy.



Chapter iv.

Containing one of the most bloody battles, or rather duels, that were
ever recorded in domestic history.


For the reasons mentioned in the preceding chapter, and from some
other matrimonial concessions, well known to most husbands, and which,
like the secrets of freemasonry, should be divulged to none who are
not members of that honourable fraternity, Mrs Partridge was pretty
well satisfied that she had condemned her husband without cause, and
endeavoured by acts of kindness to make him amends for her false
suspicion. Her passions were indeed equally violent, whichever way
they inclined; for as she could be extremely angry, so could she be
altogether as fond.

But though these passions ordinarily succeed each other, and scarce
twenty-four hours ever passed in which the pedagogue was not, in some
degree, the object of both; yet, on extraordinary occasions, when the
passion of anger had raged very high, the remission was usually
longer: and so was the case at present; for she continued longer in a
state of affability, after this fit of jealousy was ended, than her
husband had ever known before: and, had it not been for some little
exercises, which all the followers of Xantippe are obliged to perform
daily, Mr Partridge would have enjoyed a perfect serenity of several
months.

Perfect calms at sea are always suspected by the experienced mariner
to be the forerunners of a storm, and I know some persons, who,
without being generally the devotees of superstition, are apt to
apprehend that great and unusual peace or tranquillity will be
attended with its opposite. For which reason the antients used, on
such occasions, to sacrifice to the goddess Nemesis, a deity who was
thought by them to look with an invidious eye on human felicity, and
to have a peculiar delight in overturning it.

As we are very far from believing in any such heathen goddess, or from
encouraging any superstition, so we wish Mr John Fr----, or some other
such philosopher, would bestir himself a little, in order to find out
the real cause of this sudden transition from good to bad fortune,
which hath been so often remarked, and of which we shall proceed to
give an instance; for it is our province to relate facts, and we shall
leave causes to persons of much higher genius.

Mankind have always taken great delight in knowing and descanting on
the actions of others. Hence there have been, in all ages and nations,
certain places set apart for public rendezvous, where the curious
might meet and satisfy their mutual curiosity. Among these, the
barbers' shops have justly borne the pre-eminence. Among the Greeks,
barbers' news was a proverbial expression; and Horace, in one of his
epistles, makes honourable mention of the Roman barbers in the same
light.

Those of England are known to be no wise inferior to their Greek or
Roman predecessors. You there see foreign affairs discussed in a
manner little inferior to that with which they are handled in the
coffee-houses; and domestic occurrences are much more largely and
freely treated in the former than in the latter. But this serves only
for the men. Now, whereas the females of this country, especially
those of the lower order, do associate themselves much more than those
of other nations, our polity would be highly deficient, if they had
not some place set apart likewise for the indulgence of their
curiosity, seeing they are in this no way inferior to the other half
of the species.

In enjoying, therefore, such place of rendezvous, the British fair
ought to esteem themselves more happy than any of their foreign
sisters; as I do not remember either to have read in history, or to
have seen in my travels, anything of the like kind.

This place then is no other than the chandler's shop, the known seat
of all the news; or, as it is vulgarly called, gossiping, in every
parish in England.

Mrs Partridge being one day at this assembly of females, was asked by
one of her neighbours, if she had heard no news lately of Jenny Jones?
To which she answered in the negative. Upon this the other replied,
with a smile, That the parish was very much obliged to her for having
turned Jenny away as she did.

Mrs Partridge, whose jealousy, as the reader well knows, was long
since cured, and who had no other quarrel to her maid, answered
boldly, She did not know any obligation the parish had to her on that
account; for she believed Jenny had scarce left her equal behind her.

"No, truly," said the gossip, "I hope not, though I fancy we have
sluts enow too. Then you have not heard, it seems, that she hath been
brought to bed of two bastards? but as they are not born here, my
husband and the other overseer says we shall not be obliged to keep
them."

"Two bastards!" answered Mrs Partridge hastily: "you surprize me! I
don't know whether we must keep them; but I am sure they must have
been begotten here, for the wench hath not been nine months gone
away."

Nothing can be so quick and sudden as the operations of the mind,
especially when hope, or fear, or jealousy, to which the two others
are but journeymen, set it to work. It occurred instantly to her, that
Jenny had scarce ever been out of her own house while she lived with
her. The leaning over the chair, the sudden starting up, the Latin,
the smile, and many other things, rushed upon her all at once. The
satisfaction her husband expressed in the departure of Jenny, appeared
now to be only dissembled; again, in the same instant, to be real; but
yet to confirm her jealousy, proceeding from satiety, and a hundred
other bad causes. In a word, she was convinced of her husband's guilt,
and immediately left the assembly in confusion.

As fair Grimalkin, who, though the youngest of the feline family,
degenerates not in ferocity from the elder branches of her house, and
though inferior in strength, is equal in fierceness to the noble tiger
himself, when a little mouse, whom it hath long tormented in sport,
escapes from her clutches for a while, frets, scolds, growls, swears;
but if the trunk, or box, behind which the mouse lay hid be again
removed, she flies like lightning on her prey, and, with envenomed
wrath, bites, scratches, mumbles, and tears the little animal.

Not with less fury did Mrs Partridge fly on the poor pedagogue. Her
tongue, teeth, and hands, fell all upon him at once. His wig was in an
instant torn from his head, his shirt from his back, and from his face
descended five streams of blood, denoting the number of claws with
which nature had unhappily armed the enemy.

Mr Partridge acted for some time on the defensive only; indeed he
attempted only to guard his face with his hands; but as he found that
his antagonist abated nothing of her rage, he thought he might, at
least, endeavour to disarm her, or rather to confine her arms; in
doing which her cap fell off in the struggle, and her hair being too
short to reach her shoulders, erected itself on her head; her stays
likewise, which were laced through one single hole at the bottom,
burst open; and her breasts, which were much more redundant than her
hair, hung down below her middle; her face was likewise marked with
the blood of her husband: her teeth gnashed with rage; and fire, such
as sparkles from a smith's forge, darted from her eyes. So that,
altogether, this Amazonian heroine might have been an object of terror
to a much bolder man than Mr Partridge.

He had, at length, the good fortune, by getting possession of her
arms, to render those weapons which she wore at the ends of her
fingers useless; which she no sooner perceived, than the softness of
her sex prevailed over her rage, and she presently dissolved in tears,
which soon after concluded in a fit.

That small share of sense which Mr Partridge had hitherto preserved
through this scene of fury, of the cause of which he was hitherto
ignorant, now utterly abandoned him. He ran instantly into the street,
hallowing out that his wife was in the agonies of death, and
beseeching the neighbours to fly with the utmost haste to her
assistance. Several good women obeyed his summons, who entering his
house, and applying the usual remedies on such occasions, Mrs
Partridge was at length, to the great joy of her husband, brought to
herself.

As soon as she had a little recollected her spirits, and somewhat
composed herself with a cordial, she began to inform the company of
the manifold injuries she had received from her husband; who, she
said, was not contented to injure her in her bed; but, upon her
upbraiding him with it, had treated her in the cruelest manner
imaginable; had tore her cap and hair from her head, and her stays
from her body, giving her, at the same time, several blows, the marks
of which she should carry to the grave.

The poor man, who bore on his face many more visible marks of the
indignation of his wife, stood in silent astonishment at this
accusation; which the reader will, I believe, bear witness for him,
had greatly exceeded the truth; for indeed he had not struck her once;
and this silence being interpreted to be a confession of the charge by
the whole court, they all began at once, _una voce_, to rebuke and
revile him, repeating often, that none but a coward ever struck a
woman.

Mr Partridge bore all this patiently; but when his wife appealed to
the blood on her face, as an evidence of his barbarity, he could not
help laying claim to his own blood, for so it really was; as he
thought it very unnatural, that this should rise up (as we are taught
that of a murdered person often doth) in vengeance against him.

To this the women made no other answer, than that it was a pity it had
not come from his heart, instead of his face; all declaring, that, if
their husbands should lift their hands against them, they would have
their hearts' bloods out of their bodies.

After much admonition for what was past, and much good advice to Mr
Partridge for his future behaviour, the company at length departed,
and left the husband and wife to a personal conference together, in
which Mr Partridge soon learned the cause of all his sufferings.



Chapter v.

Containing much matter to exercise the judgment and reflection of the
reader.


I believe it is a true observation, that few secrets are divulged to
one person only; but certainly, it would be next to a miracle that a
fact of this kind should be known to a whole parish, and not transpire
any farther.

And, indeed, a very few days had past, before the country, to use a
common phrase, rung of the schoolmaster of Little Baddington; who was
said to have beaten his wife in the most cruel manner. Nay, in some
places it was reported he had murdered her; in others, that he had
broke her arms; in others, her legs: in short, there was scarce an
injury which can be done to a human creature, but what Mrs Partridge
was somewhere or other affirmed to have received from her husband.

The cause of this quarrel was likewise variously reported; for as some
people said that Mrs Partridge had caught her husband in bed with his
maid, so many other reasons, of a very different kind, went abroad.
Nay, some transferred the guilt to the wife, and the jealousy to the
husband.

Mrs Wilkins had long ago heard of this quarrel; but, as a different
cause from the true one had reached her ears, she thought proper to
conceal it; and the rather, perhaps, as the blame was universally laid
on Mr Partridge; and his wife, when she was servant to Mr Allworthy,
had in something offended Mrs Wilkins, who was not of a very forgiving
temper.

But Mrs Wilkins, whose eyes could see objects at a distance, and who
could very well look forward a few years into futurity, had perceived
a strong likelihood of Captain Blifil's being hereafter her master;
and as she plainly discerned that the captain bore no great goodwill
to the little foundling, she fancied it would be rendering him an
agreeable service, if she could make any discoveries that might lessen
the affection which Mr Allworthy seemed to have contracted for this
child, and which gave visible uneasiness to the captain, who could not
entirely conceal it even before Allworthy himself; though his wife,
who acted her part much better in public, frequently recommended to
him her own example, of conniving at the folly of her brother, which,
she said, she at least as well perceived, and as much resented, as any
other possibly could.

Mrs Wilkins having therefore, by accident, gotten a true scent of the
above story,--though long after it had happened, failed not to satisfy
herself thoroughly of all the particulars; and then acquainted the
captain, that she had at last discovered the true father of the little
bastard, which she was sorry, she said, to see her master lose his
reputation in the country, by taking so much notice of.

The captain chid her for the conclusion of her speech, as an improper
assurance in judging of her master's actions: for if his honour, or
his understanding, would have suffered the captain to make an alliance
with Mrs Wilkins, his pride would by no means have admitted it. And to
say the truth, there is no conduct less politic, than to enter into
any confederacy with your friend's servants against their master: for
by these means you afterwards become the slave of these very servants;
by whom you are constantly liable to be betrayed. And this
consideration, perhaps it was, which prevented Captain Blifil from
being more explicit with Mrs Wilkins, or from encouraging the abuse
which she had bestowed on Allworthy.

But though he declared no satisfaction to Mrs Wilkins at this
discovery, he enjoyed not a little from it in his own mind, and
resolved to make the best use of it he was able.

He kept this matter a long time concealed within his own breast, in
hopes that Mr Allworthy might hear it from some other person; but Mrs
Wilkins, whether she resented the captain's behaviour, or whether his
cunning was beyond her, and she feared the discovery might displease
him, never afterwards opened her lips about the matter.

I have thought it somewhat strange, upon reflection, that the
housekeeper never acquainted Mrs Blifil with this news, as women are
more inclined to communicate all pieces of intelligence to their own
sex, than to ours. The only way, as it appears to me, of solving this
difficulty, is, by imputing it to that distance which was now grown
between the lady and the housekeeper: whether this arose from a
jealousy in Mrs Blifil, that Wilkins showed too great a respect to the
foundling; for while she was endeavouring to ruin the little infant,
in order to ingratiate herself with the captain, she was every day
more and more commending it before Allworthy, as his fondness for it
every day increased. This, notwithstanding all the care she took at
other times to express the direct contrary to Mrs Blifil, perhaps
offended that delicate lady, who certainly now hated Mrs Wilkins; and
though she did not, or possibly could not, absolutely remove her from
her place, she found, however, the means of making her life very
uneasy. This Mrs Wilkins, at length, so resented, that she very openly
showed all manner of respect and fondness to little Tommy, in
opposition to Mrs Blifil.

The captain, therefore, finding the story in danger of perishing, at
last took an opportunity to reveal it himself.

He was one day engaged with Mr Allworthy in a discourse on charity: in
which the captain, with great learning, proved to Mr Allworthy, that
the word charity in Scripture nowhere means beneficence or generosity.

"The Christian religion," he said, "was instituted for much nobler
purposes, than to enforce a lesson which many heathen philosophers had
taught us long before, and which, though it might perhaps be called a
moral virtue, savoured but little of that sublime, Christian-like
disposition, that vast elevation of thought, in purity approaching to
angelic perfection, to be attained, expressed, and felt only by grace.
Those," he said, "came nearer to the Scripture meaning, who understood
by it candour, or the forming of a benevolent opinion of our brethren,
and passing a favourable judgment on their actions; a virtue much
higher, and more extensive in its nature, than a pitiful distribution
of alms, which, though we would never so much prejudice, or even ruin
our families, could never reach many; whereas charity, in the other
and truer sense, might be extended to all mankind."

He said, "Considering who the disciples were, it would be absurd to
conceive the doctrine of generosity, or giving alms, to have been
preached to them. And, as we could not well imagine this doctrine
should be preached by its Divine Author to men who could not practise
it, much less should we think it understood so by those who can
practise it, and do not.

"But though," continued he, "there is, I am afraid, little merit in
these benefactions, there would, I must confess, be much pleasure in
them to a good mind, if it was not abated by one consideration. I
mean, that we are liable to be imposed upon, and to confer our
choicest favours often on the undeserving, as you must own was your
case in your bounty to that worthless fellow Partridge: for two or
three such examples must greatly lessen the inward satisfaction which
a good man would otherwise find in generosity; nay, may even make him
timorous in bestowing, lest he should be guilty of supporting vice,
and encouraging the wicked; a crime of a very black dye, and for which
it will by no means be a sufficient excuse, that we have not actually
intended such an encouragement; unless we have used the utmost caution
in chusing the objects of our beneficence. A consideration which, I
make no doubt, hath greatly checked the liberality of many a worthy
and pious man."

Mr Allworthy answered, "He could not dispute with the captain in the
Greek language, and therefore could say nothing as to the true sense
of the word which is translated charity; but that he had always
thoue. She resolved
therefore to avoid Tom Jones as much as possible; for which purpose
she began to conceive a design of visiting her aunt, to which she made
no doubt of obtaining her father's consent.

But Fortune, who had other designs in her head, put an immediate stop
to any such proceeding, by introducing an accident, which will be
related in the next chapter.



Chapter xiii.

A dreadful accident which befel Sophia. The gallant behaviour of
Jones, and the more dreadful consequence of that behaviour to the
young lady; with a short digression in favour of the female sex.


Mr Western grew every day fonder and fonder of Sophia, insomuch that
his beloved dogs themselves almost gave place to her in his
affections; but as he could not prevail on himself to abandon these,
he contrived very cunningly to enjoy their company, together with that
of his daughter, by insisting on her riding a hunting with him.

Sophia, to whom her father's word was a law, readily complied with his
desires, though she had not the least delight in a sport, which was of
too rough and masculine a nature to suit with her disposition. She had
however another motive, beside her obedience, to accompany the old
gentleman in the chase; for by her presence she hoped in some measure
to restrain his impetuosity, and to prevent him from so frequently
exposing his neck to the utmost hazard.

The strongest objection was that which would have formerly been an
inducement to her, namely, the frequent meeting with young Jones, whom
she had determined to avoid; but as the end of the hunting season now
approached, she hoped, by a short absence with her aunt, to reason
herself entirely out of her unfortunate passion; and had not any doubt
of being able to meet him in the field the subsequent season without
the least danger.

On the second day of her hunting, as she was returning from the chase,
and was arrived within a little distance from Mr Western's house, her
horse, whose mettlesome spirit required a better rider, fell suddenly
to prancing and capering in such a manner that she was in the most
imminent peril of falling. Tom Jones, who was at a little distance
behind, saw this, and immediately galloped up to her assistance. As
soon as he came up, he leapt from his own horse, and caught hold of
hers by the bridle. The unruly beast presently reared himself an end
on his hind legs, and threw his lovely burthen from his back, and
Jones caught her in his arms.

She was so affected with the fright, that she was not immediately able
to satisfy Jones, who was very sollicitous to know whether she had
received any hurt. She soon after, however, recovered her spirits,
assured him she was safe, and thanked him for the care he had taken of
her. Jones answered, "If I have preserved you, madam, I am
sufficiently repaid; for I promise you, I would have secured you from
the least harm at the expense of a much greater misfortune to myself
than I have suffered on this occasion."

"What misfortune?" replied Sophia eagerly; "I hope you have come to no
mischief?"

"Be not concerned, madam," answered Jones. "Heaven be praised you have
escaped so well, considering the danger you was in. If I have broke my
arm, I consider it as a trifle, in comparison of what I feared upon
your account."

Sophia then screamed out, "Broke your arm! Heaven forbid."

"I am afraid I have, madam," says Jones: "but I beg you will suffer me
first to take care of you. I have a right hand yet at your service, to
help you into the next field, whence we have but a very little walk to
your father's house."

Sophia seeing his left arm dangling by his side, while he was using
the other to lead her, no longer doubted of the truth. She now grew
much paler than her fears for herself had made her before. All her
limbs were seized with a trembling, insomuch that Jones could scarce
support her; and as her thoughts were in no less agitation, she could
not refrain from giving Jones a look so full of tenderness, that it
almost argued a stronger sensation in her mind, than even gratitude
and pity united can raise in the gentlest female bosom, without the
assistance of a third more powerful passion.

Mr Western, who was advanced at some distance when this accident
happened, was now returned, as were the rest of the horsemen. Sophia
immediately acquainted them with what had befallen Jones, and begged
them to take care of him. Upon which Western, who had been much
alarmed by meeting his daughter's horse without its rider, and was now
overjoyed to find her unhurt, cried out, "I am glad it is no worse. If
Tom hath broken his arm, we will get a joiner to mend un again."

The squire alighted from his horse, and proceeded to his house on
foot, with his daughter and Jones. An impartial spectator, who had met
them on the way, would, on viewing their several countenances, have
concluded Sophia alone to have been the object of compassion: for as
to Jones, he exulted in having probably saved the life of the young
lady, at the price only of a broken bone; and Mr Western, though he
was not unconcerned at the accident which had befallen Jones, was,
however, delighted in a much higher degree with the fortunate escape
of his daughter.

The generosity of Sophia's temper construed this behaviour of Jones
into great bravery; and it made a deep impression on her heart: for
certain it is, that there is no one quality which so generally
recommends men to women as this; proceeding, if we believe the common
opinion, from that natural timidity of the sex, which is, says Mr
Osborne, "so great, that a woman is the most cowardly of all the
creatures God ever made;"--a sentiment more remarkable for its
bluntness than for its truth. Aristotle, in his Politics, doth them, I
believe, more justice, when he says, "The modesty and fortitude of men
differ from those virtues in women; for the fortitude which becomes a
woman, would be cowardice in a man; and the modesty which becomes a
man, would be pertness in a woman." Nor is there, perhaps, more of
truth in the opinion of those who derive the partiality which women
are inclined to show to the brave, from this excess of their fear. Mr
Bayle (I think, in his article of Helen) imputes this, and with
greater probability, to their violent love of glory; for the truth of
which, we have the authority of him who of all others saw farthest
into human nature, and who introduces the heroine of his Odyssey, the
great pattern of matrimonial love and constancy, assigning the glory
of her husband as the only source of her affection towards him.[*]

  [*] The English reader will not find this in the poem; for the
  sentiment is entirely left out in the translation.

However this be, certain it is that the accident operated very
strongly on Sophia; and, indeed, after much enquiry into the matter, I
am inclined to believe, that, at this very time, the charming Sophia
made no less impression on the heart of Jones; to say truth, he had
for some time become sensible of the irresistible power of her charms.



Chapter xiv.

The arrival of a surgeon.--His operations, and a long dialogue between
Sophia and her maid.


When they arrived at Mr Western's hall, Sophia, who had tottered along
with much difficulty, sunk down in her chair; but by the assistance of
hartshorn and water, she was prevented from fainting away, and had
pretty well recovered her spirits, when the surgeon who was sent for
to Jones appeared. Mr Western, who imputed these symptoms in his
daughter to her fall, advised her to be presently blooded by way of
prevention. In this opinion he was seconded by the surgeon, who gave
so many reasons for bleeding, and quoted so many cases where persons
had miscarried for want of it, that the squire became very
importunate, and indeed insisted peremptorily that his daughter should
be blooded.

Sophia soon yielded to the commands of her father, though entirely
contrary to her own inclinations, for she suspected, I believe, less
danger from the fright, than either the squire or the surgeon. She
then stretched out her beautiful arm, and the operator began to
prepare for his work.

While the servants were busied in providing materials, the surgeon,
who imputed the backwardness which had appeared in Sophia to her
fears, began to comfort her with assurances that there was not the
least danger; for no accident, he said, could ever happen in bleeding,
but from the monstrous ignorance of pretenders to surgery, which he
pretty plainly insinuated was not at present to be apprehended. Sophia
declared she was not under the least apprehension; adding, "If you
open an artery, I promise you I'll forgive you." "Will you?" cries
Western: "D--n me, if I will. If he does thee the least mischief, d--n
me if I don't ha' the heart's blood o'un out." The surgeon assented to
bleed her upon these conditions, and then proceeded to his operation,
which he performed with as much dexterity as he had promised; and with
as much quickness: for he took but little blood from her, saying, it
was much safer to bleed again and again, than to take away too much at
once.

Sophia, when her arm was bound up, retired: for she was not willing
(nor was it, perhaps, strictly decent) to be present at the operation
on Jones. Indeed, one objection which she had to bleeding (though she
did not make it) was the delay which it would occasion to setting the
broken bone. For Western, when Sophia was concerned, had no
consideration but for her; and as for Jones himself, he "sat like
patience on a monument smiling at grief." To say the truth, when he
saw the blood springing from the lovely arm of Sophia, he scarce
thought of what had happened to himself.

The surgeon now ordered his patient to be stript to his shirt, and
then entirely baring the arm, he began to stretch and examine it, in
such a manner that the tortures he put him to caused Jones to make
several wry faces; which the surgeon observing, greatly wondered at,
crying, "What is the matter, sir? I am sure it is impossible I should
hurt you." And then holding forth the broken arm, he began a long and
very learned lecture of anatomy, in which simple and double fractures
were most accurately considered; and the several ways in which Jones
might have broken his arm were discussed, with proper annotations
showing how many of these would have been better, and how many worse
than the present case.

Having at length finished his laboured harangue, with which the
audience, though it had greatly raised their attention and admiration,
were not much edified, as they really understood not a single syllable
of all he had said, he proceeded to business, which he was more
expeditious in finishing, than he had been in beginning.

Jones was then ordered into a bed, which Mr Western compelled him to
accept at his own house, and sentence of water-gruel was passed upon
him.

Among the good company which had attended in the hall during the
bone-setting, Mrs Honour was one; who being summoned to her mistress
as soon as it was over, and asked by her how the young gentleman did,
presently launched into extravagant praises on the magnanimity, as she
called it, of his behaviour, which, she said, "was so charming in so
pretty a creature." She then burst forth into much warmer encomiums on
the beauty of his person; enumerating many particulars, and ending
with the whiteness of his skin.

This discourse had an effect on Sophia's countenance, which would not
perhaps have escaped the observance of the sagacious waiting-woman,
had she once looked her mistress in the face, all the time she was
speaking: but as a looking-glass, which was most commodiously placed
opposite to her, gave her an opportunity of surveying those features,
in which, of all others, she took most delight; so she had not once
removed her eyes from that amiable object during her whole speech.

Mrs Honour was so intirely wrapped up in the subject on which she
exercised her tongue, and the object before her eyes, that she gave
her mistress time to conquer her confusion; which having done, she
smiled on her maid, and told her, "she was certainly in love with this
young fellow."--"I in love, madam!" answers she: "upon my word, ma'am,
I assure you, ma'am, upon my soul, ma'am, I am not."--"Why, if you
was," cries her mistress, "I see no reason that you should be ashamed
of it; for he is certainly a pretty fellow."--"Yes, ma'am," answered
the other, "that he is, the most handsomest man I ever saw in my life.
Yes, to be sure, that he is, and, as your ladyship says, I don't know
why I should be ashamed of loving him, though he is my betters. To be
sure, gentlefolks are but flesh and blood no more than us servants.
Besides, as for Mr Jones, thof Squire Allworthy hath made a gentleman
of him, he was not so good as myself by birth: for thof I am a poor
body, I am an honest person's child, and my father and mother were
married, which is more than some people can say, as high as they hold
their heads. Marry, come up! I assure you, my dirty cousin! thof his
skin be so white, and to be sure it is the most whitest that ever was
seen, I am a Christian as well as he, and nobody can say that I am
base born: my grandfather was a clergyman,[*] and would have been very
angry, I believe, to have thought any of his family should have taken
up with Molly Seagrim's dirty leavings."

  [*] This is the second person of low condition whom we have recorded
  in this history to have sprung from the clergy. It is to be hoped
  such instances will, in future ages, when some provision is made for
  the families of the inferior clergy, appear stranger than they can
  be thought at present.

Perhaps Sophia might have suffered her maid to run on in this manner,
from wanting sufficient spirits to stop her tongue, which the reader
may probably conjecture was no very easy task; for certainly there
were some passages in her speech which were far from being agreeable
to the lady. However, she now checked the torrent, as there seemed no
end of its flowing. "I wonder," says she, "at your assurance in daring
to talk thus of one of my father's friends. As to the wench, I order
you never to mention her name to me. And with regard to the young
gentleman's birth, those who can say nothing more to his disadvantage,
may as well be silent on that head, as I desire you will be for the
future."

"I am sorry I have offended your ladyship," answered Mrs Honour. "I am
sure I hate Molly Seagrim as much as your ladyship can; and as for
abusing Squire Jones, I can call all the servants in the house to
witness, that whenever any talk hath been about bastards, I have
always taken his part; for which of you, says I to the footmen, would
not be a bastard, if he could, to be made a gentleman of? And, says I,
I am sure he is a very fine gentleman; and he hath one of the whitest
hands in the world; for to be sure so he hath: and, says I, one of the
sweetest temperedest, best naturedest men in the world he is; and,
says I, all the servants and neighbours all round the country loves
him. And, to be sure, I could tell your ladyship something, but that I
am afraid it would offend you."--"What could you tell me, Honour?"
says Sophia. "Nay, ma'am, to be sure he meant nothing by it, therefore
I would not have your ladyship be offended."--"Prithee tell me," says
Sophia; "I will know it this instant."--"Why, ma'am," answered Mrs
Honour, "he came into the room one day last week when I was at work,
and there lay your ladyship's muff on a chair, and to be sure he put
his hands into it; that very muff your ladyship gave me but yesterday.
La! says I, Mr Jones, you will stretch my lady's muff, and spoil it:
but he still kept his hands in it: and then he kissed it--to be sure I
hardly ever saw such a kiss in my life as he gave it."--"I suppose he
did not know it was mine," replied Sophia. "Your ladyship shall hear,
ma'am. He kissed it again and again, and said it was the prettiest
muff in the world. La! sir, says I, you have seen it a hundred times.
Yes, Mrs Honour, cried he; but who can see anything beautiful in the
presence of your lady but herself?--Nay, that's not all neither; but I
hope your ladyship won't be offended, for to be sure he meant nothing.
One day, as your ladyship was playing on the harpsichord to my master,
Mr Jones was sitting in the next room, and methought he looked
melancholy. La! says I, Mr Jones, what's the matter? a penny for your
thoughts, says I. Why, hussy, says he, starting up from a dream, what
can I be thinking of, when that angel your mistress is playing? And
then squeezing me by the hand, Oh! Mrs Honour, says he, how happy will
that man be!--and then he sighed. Upon my troth, his breath is as
sweet as a nosegay.--But to be sure he meant no harm by it. So I hope
your ladyship will not mention a word; for he gave me a crown never to
mention it, and made me swear upon a book, but I believe, indeed, it
was not the Bible."

Till something of a more beautiful red than vermilion be found out, I
shall say nothing of Sophia's colour on this occasion. "Ho--nour,"
says she, "I--if you will not mention this any more to me--nor to
anybody else, I will not betray you--I mean, I will not be angry; but
I am afraid of your tongue. Why, my girl, will you give it such
liberties?"--"Nay, ma'am," answered she, "to be sure, I would sooner
cut out my tongue than offend your ladyship. To be sure I shall never
mention a word that your ladyship would not have me."--"Why, I would
not have you mention this any more," said Sophia, "for it may come to
my father's ears, and he would be angry with Mr Jones; though I really
believe, as you say, he meant nothing. I should be very angry myself,
if I imagined--"--"Nay, ma'am," says Honour, "I protest I believe he
meant nothing. I thought he talked as if he was out of his senses;
nay, he said he believed he was beside himself when he had spoken the
words. Ay, sir, says I, I believe so too. Yes, says he, Honour.--But I
ask your ladyship's pardon; I could tear my tongue out for offending
you." "Go on," says Sophia; "you may mention anything you have not
told me before."--"Yes, Honour, says he (this was some time
afterwards, when he gave me the crown), I am neither such a coxcomb,
or such a villain, as to think of her in any other delight but as my
goddess; as such I will always worship and adore her while I have
breath.--This was all, ma'am, I will be sworn, to the best of my
remembrance. I was in a passion with him myself, till I found he meant
no harm."--"Indeed, Honour," says Sophia, "I believe you have a real
affection for me. I was provoked the other day when I gave you
warning; but if you have a desire to stay with me, you shall."--"To be
sure, ma'am," answered Mrs Honour, "I shall never desire to part with
your ladyship. To be sure, I almost cried my eyes out when you gave me
warning. It would be very ungrateful in me to desire to leave your
ladyship; because as why, I should never get so good a place again. I
am sure I would live and die with your ladyship; for, as poor Mr Jones
said, happy is the man----"

Here the dinner bell interrupted a conversation which had wrought such
an effect on Sophia, that she was, perhaps, more obliged to her
bleeding in the morning, than she, at the time, had apprehended she
should be. As to the present situation of her mind, I shall adhere to
a rule of Horace, by not attempting to describe it, from despair of
success. Most of my readers will suggest it easily to themselves; and
the few who cannot, would not understand the picture, or at least
would deny it to be natural, if ever so well drawn.




BOOK V.

CONTAINING A PORTION OF TIME SOMEWHAT LONGER THAN HALF A YEAR.



Chapter i.

Of the SERIOUS in writing, and for what purpose it is introduced.


Peradventure there may be no parts in this prodigious work which will
give the reader less pleasure in the perusing, than those which have
given the author the greatest pains in composing. Among these probably
may be reckoned those initial essays which we have prefixed to the
historical matter contained in every book; and which we have
determined to be essentially necessary to this kind of writing, of
which we have set ourselves at the head.

For this our determination we do not hold ourselves strictly bound to
assign any reason; it being abundantly sufficient that we have laid it
down as a rule necessary to be observed in all prosai-comi-epic
writing. Who ever demanded the reasons of that nice unity of time or
place which is now established to be so essential to dramatic poetry?
What critic hath been ever asked, why a play may not contain two days
as well as one? Or why the audience (provided they travel, like
electors, without any expense) may not be wafted fifty miles as well
as five? Hath any commentator well accounted for the limitation which
an antient critic hath set to the drama, which he will have contain
neither more nor less than five acts? Or hath any one living attempted
to explain what the modern judges of our theatres mean by that word
_low_; by which they have happily succeeded in banishing all humour
from the stage, and have made the theatre as dull as a drawing-room!
Upon all these occasions the world seems to have embraced a maxim of
our law, viz., _cuicunque in arte sua perito credendum est:_ for it
seems perhaps difficult to conceive that any one should have had
enough of impudence to lay down dogmatical rules in any art or science
without the least foundation. In such cases, therefore, we are apt to
conclude there are sound and good reasons at the bottom, though we are
unfortunately not able to see so far.

Now, in reality, the world have paid too great a compliment to
critics, and have imagined them men of much greater profundity than
they really are. From this complacence, the critics have been
emboldened to assume a dictatorial power, and have so far succeeded,
that they are now become the masters, and have the assurance to give
laws to those authors from whose predecessors they originally received
them.

The critic, rightly considered, is no more than the clerk, whose
office it is to transcribe the rules and laws laid down by those great
judges whose vast strength of genius hath placed them in the light of
legislators, in the several sciences over which they presided. This
office was all which the critics of old aspired to; nor did they ever
dare to advance a sentence, without supporting it by the authority of
the judge from whence it was borrowed.

But in process of time, and in ages of ignorance, the clerk began to
invade the power and assume the dignity of his master. The laws of
writing were no longer founded on the practice of the author, but on
the dictates of the critic. The clerk became the legislator, and those
very peremptorily gave laws whose business it was, at first, only to
transcribe them.

Hence arose an obvious, and perhaps an unavoidable error; for these
critics being men of shallow capacities, very easily mistook mere form
for substance. They acted as a judge would, who should adhere to the
lifeless letter of law, and reject the spirit. Little circumstances,
which were perhaps accidental in a great author, were by these critics
considered to constitute his chief merit, and transmitted as
essentials to be observed by all his successors. To these
encroachments, time and ignorance, the two great supporters of
imposture, gave authority; and thus many rules for good writing have
been established, which have not the least foundation in truth or
nature; and which commonly serve for no other purpose than to curb and
restrain genius, in the same manner as it would have restrained the
dancing-master, had the many excellent treatises on that art laid it
down as an essential rule that every man must dance in chains.

To avoid, therefore, all imputation of laying down a rule for
posterity, founded only on the authority of _ipse dixit_--for which,
to say the truth, we have not the profoundest veneration--we shall
here waive the privilege above contended for, and proceed to lay
before the reader the reasons which have induced us to intersperse
these several digressive essays in the course of this work.

And here we shall of necessity be led to open a new vein of knowledge,
which if it hath been discovered, hath not, to our remembrance, been
wrought on by any antient or modern writer. This vein is no other than
that of contrast, which runs through all the works of the creation,
and may probably have a large share in constituting in us the idea of
all beauty, as well natural as artificial: for what demonstrates the
beauty and excellence of anything but its reverse? Thus the beauty of
day, and that of summer, is set off by the horrors of night and
winter. And, I believe, if it was possible for a man to have seen only
the two former, he would have a very imperfect idea of their beauty.

But to avoid too serious an air; can it be doubted, but that the
finest woman in the world would lose all benefit of her charms in the
eye of a man who had never seen one of another cast? The ladies
themselves seem so sensible of this, that they are all industrious to
procure foils: nay, they will become foils to themselves; for I have
observed (at Bath particularly) that they endeavour to appear as ugly
as possible in the morning, in order to set off that beauty which they
intend to show you in the evening.

Most artists have this secret in practice, though some, perhaps, have
not much studied the theory. The jeweller knows that the finest
brilliant requires a foil; and the painter, by the contrast of his
figures, often acquires great applause.

A great genius among us will illustrate this matter fully. I cannot,
indeed, range him under any general head of common artists, as he hath
a title to be placed among those

       _Inventas qui vitam excoluere per artes._
        Who by invented arts have life improved.

I mean here the inventor of that most exquisite entertainment, called
the English Pantomime.

This entertainment consisted of two parts, which the inventor
distinguished by the names of the serious and the comic. The serious
exhibited a certain number of heathen gods and heroes, who were
certainly the worst and dullest company into which an audience was
ever introduced; and (which was a secret known to few) were actually
intended so to be, in order to contrast the comic part of the
entertainment, and to display the tricks of harlequin to the better
advantage.

This was, perhaps, no very civil use of such personages: but the
contrivance was, nevertheless, ingenious enough, and had its effect.
And this will now plainly appear, if, instead of serious and comic, we
supply the words duller and dullest; for the comic was certainly
duller than anything before shown on the stage, and could be set off
only by that superlative degree of dulness which composed the serious.
So intolerably serious, indeed, were these gods and heroes, that
harlequin (though the English gentleman of that name is not at all
related to the French family, for he is of a much more serious
disposition) was always welcome on the stage, as he relieved the
audience from worse company.

Judicious writers have always practised this art of contrast with
great success. I have been surprized that Horace should cavil at this
art in Homer; but indeed he contradicts himself in the very next line:

     _Indignor quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus;
     Verum opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum._

     I grieve if e'er great Homer chance to sleep,
     Yet slumbers on long works have right to creep.

For we are not here to understand, as perhaps some have, that an
author actually falls asleep while he is writing. It is true, that
readers are too apt to be so overtaken; but if the work was as long as
any of Oldmixon, the author himself is too well entertained to be
subject to the least drowsiness. He is, as Mr Pope observes,

     Sleepless himself to give his readers sleep.

To say the truth, these soporific parts are so many scenes of serious
artfully interwoven, in order to contrast and set off the rest; and
this is the true meaning of a late facetious writer, who told the
public that whenever he was dull they might be assured there was a
design in it.

In this light, then, or rather in this darkness, I would have the
reader to consider these initial essays. And after this warning, if he
shall be of opinion that he can find enough of serious in other parts
of this history, he may pass over these, in which we profess to be
laboriously dull, and begin the following books at the second chapter.



Chapter ii.

In which Mr Jones receives many friendly visits during his
confinement; with some fine touches of the passion of love, scarce
visible to the naked eye.


Tom Jones had many visitors during his confinement, though some,
perhaps, were not very agreeable to him. Mr Allworthy saw him almost
every day; but though he pitied Tom's sufferings, and greatly approved
the gallant behaviour which had occasioned them; yet he thought this
was a favourable opportunity to bring him to a sober sense of his
indiscreet conduct; and that wholesome advice for that purpose could
never be applied at a more proper season than at the present, when the
mind was softened by pain and sickness, and alarmed by danger; and
when its attention was unembarrassed with those turbulent passions
which engage us in the pursuit of pleasure.

At all seasons, therefore, when the good man was alone with the youth,
especially when the latter was totally at ease, he took occasion to
remind him of his former miscarriages, but in the mildest and
tenderest manner, and only in order to introduce the caution which he
prescribed for his future behaviour; "on which alone," he assured him,
"would depend his own felicity, and the kindness which he might yet
promise himself to receive at the hands of his father by adoption,
unless he should hereafter forfeit his good opinion: for as to what
had past," he said, "it should be all forgiven and forgotten. He
therefore advised him to make a good use of this accident, that so in
the end it might prove a visitation for his own good."

Thwackum was likewise pretty assiduous in his visits; and he too
considered a sick-bed to be a convenient scene for lectures. His
stile, however, was more severe than Mr Allworthy's: he told his
pupil, "That he ought to look on his broken limb as a judgment from
heaven on his sins. That it would become him to be daily on his knees,
pouring forth thanksgivings that he had broken his arm only, and not
his neck; which latter," he said, "was very probably reserved for some
future occasion, and that, perhaps, not very remote. For his part," he
said, "he had often wondered some judgment had not overtaken him
before; but it might be perceived by this, that Divine punishments,
though slow, are always sure." Hence likewise he advised him, "to
foresee, with equal certainty, the greater evils which were yet
behind, and which were as sure as this of overtaking him in his state
of reprobacy. These are," said he, "to be averted only by such a
thorough and sincere repentance as is not to be expected or hoped for
from one so abandoned in his youth, and whose mind, I am afraid, is
totally corrupted. It is my duty, however, to exhort you to this
repentance, though I too well know all exhortations will be vain and
fruitless. But _liberavi animam meam._ I can accuse my own conscience
of no neglect; though it is at the same time with the utmost concern I
see you travelling on to certain misery in this world, and to as
certain damnation in the next."

Square talked in a very different strain; he said, "Such accidents as
a broken bone were below the consideration of a wise man. That it was
abundantly sufficient to reconcile the mind to any of these
mischances, to reflect that they are liable to befal the wisest of
mankind, and are undoubtedly for the good of the whole." He said, "It
was a mere abuse of words to call those things evils, in which there
was no moral unfitness: that pain, which was the worst consequence of
such accidents, was the most contemptible thing in the world;" with
more of the like sentences, extracted out of the second book of
Tully's Tusculan questions, and from the great Lord Shaftesbury. In
pronouncing these he was one day so eager, that he unfortunately bit
his tongue; and in such a manner, that it not only put an end to his
discourse, but created much emotion in him, and caused him to mutter
an oath or two: but what was worst of all, this accident gave
Thwackum, who was present, and who held all such doctrine to be
heathenish and atheistical, an opportunity to clap a judgment on his
back. Now this was done with so malicious a sneer, that it totally
unhinged (if I may so say) the temper of the philosopher, which the
bite of his tongue had somewhat ruffled; and as he was disabled from
venting his wrath at his lips, he had possibly found a more violent
method of revenging himself, had not the surgeon, who was then luckily
in the room, contrary to his own interest, interposed and preserved
the peace.

Mr Blifil visited his friend Jones but seldom, and never alone. This
worthy young man, however, professed much regard for him, and as great
concern at his misfortune; but cautiously avoided any intimacy, lest,
as he frequently hinted, it might contaminate the sobriety of his own
character: for which purpose he had constantly in his mouth that
proverb in which Solomon speaks against evil communication. Not that
he was so bitter as Thwackum; for he always expressed some hopes of
Tom's reformation; "which," he said, "the unparalleled goodness shown
by his uncle on this occasion, must certainly effect in one not
absolutely abandoned:" but concluded, "if Mr Jones ever offends
hereafter, I shall not be able to say a syllable in his favour."

As to Squire Western, he was seldom out of the sick-room, unless when
he was engaged either in the field or over his bottle. Nay, he would
sometimes retire hither to take his beer, and it was not without
difficulty that he was prevented from forcing Jones to take his beer
too: for no quack ever held his nostrum to be a more general panacea
than he did this; which, he said, had more virtue in it than was in
all the physic in an apothecary's shop. He was, however, by much
entreaty, prevailed on to forbear the application of this medicine;
but from serenading his patient every hunting morning with the horn
under his window, it was impossible to withhold him; nor did he ever
lay aside that hallow, with which he entered into all companies, when
he visited Jones, without any regard to the sick person's being at
that time either awake or asleep.

This boisterous behaviour, as it meant no harm, so happily it effected
none, and was abundantly compensated to Jones, as soon as he was able
to sit up, by the company of Sophia, whom the squire then brought to
visit him; nor was it, indeed, long before Jones was able to attend
her to the harpsichord, where she would kindly condescend, for hours
together, to charm him with the most delicious music, unless when the
squire thought proper to interrupt her, by insisting on Old Sir Simon,
or some other of his favourite pieces.

Notwithstanding the nicest guard which Sophia endeavoured to set on
her behaviour, she could not avoid letting some appearances now and
then slip forth: for love may again be likened to a disease in this,
that when it is denied a vent in one part, it will certainly break out
in another. What her lips, therefore, concealed, her eyes, her
blushes, and many little involuntary actions, betrayed.

One day, when Sophia was playing on the harpsichord, and Jones was
attending, the squire came into the room, crying, "There, Tom, I have
had a battle for thee below-stairs with thick parson Thwackum. He hath
been a telling Allworthy, before my face, that the broken bone was a
judgment upon thee. D--n it, says I, how can that be? Did he not come
by it in defence of a young woman? A judgment indeed! Pox, if he never
doth anything worse, he will go to heaven sooner than all the parsons
in the country. He hath more reason to glory in it than to be ashamed
of it."--"Indeed, sir," says Jones, "I have no reason for either; but
if it preserved Miss Western, I shall always think it the happiest
accident of my life."--"And to gu," said the squire, "to zet Allworthy
against thee vor it! D--n un, if the parson had unt his petticuoats
on, I should have lent un o flick; for I love thee dearly, my boy, and
d--n me if there is anything in my power which I won't do for thee.
Sha't take thy choice of all the horses in my stable to-morrow
morning, except only the Chevalier and Miss Slouch." Jones thanked
him, but declined accepting the offer. "Nay," added the squire, "sha't
ha the sorrel mare that Sophy rode. She cost me fifty guineas, and
comes six years old this grass." "If she had cost me a thousand,"
cries Jones passionately, "I would have given her to the dogs." "Pooh!
pooh!" answered Western; "what! because she broke thy arm? Shouldst
forget and forgive. I thought hadst been more a man than to bear
malice against a dumb creature."--Here Sophia interposed, and put an
end to the conversation, by desiring her father's leave to play to
him; a request which he never refused.

The countenance of Sophia had undergone more than one change during
the foregoing speeches; and probably she imputed the passionate
resentment which Jones had expressed against the mare, to a different
motive from that from which her father had derived it. Her spirits
were at this time in a visible flutter; and she played so intolerably
ill, that had not Western soon fallen asleep, he must have remarked
it. Jones, however, who was sufficiently awake, and was not without an
ear any more than without eyes, made some observations; which being
joined to all which the reader may remember to have passed formerly,
gave him pretty strong assurances, when he came to reflect on the
whole, that all was not well in the tender bosom of Sophia; an opinion
which many young gentlemen will, I doubt not, extremely wonder at his
not having been well confirmed in long ago. To confess the truth, he
had rather too much diffidence in himself, and was not forward enough
in seeing the advances of a young lady; a misfortune which can be
cured only by that early town education, which is at present so
generally in fashion.

When these thoughts had fully taken possession of Jones, they
occasioned a perturbation in his mind, which, in a constitution less
pure and firm than his, might have been, at such a season, attended
with very dangerous consequences. He was truly sensible of the great
worth of Sophia. He extremely liked her person, no less admired her
accomplishments, and tenderly loved her goodness. In reality, as he
had never once entertained any thought of possessing her, nor had ever
given the least voluntary indulgence to his inclinations, he had a
much stronger passion for her than he himself was acquainted with. His
heart now brought forth the full secret, at the same time that it
assured him the adorable object returned his affection.



Chapter iii.

Which all who have no heart will think to contain much ado about
nothing.


The reader will perhaps imagine the sensations which now arose in
Jones to have been so sweet and delicious, that they would rather tend
to produce a chearful serenity in the mind, than any of those
dangerous effects which we have mentioned; but in fact, sensations of
this kind, however delicious, are, at their first recognition, of a
very tumultuous nature, and have very little of the opiate in them.
They were, moreover, in the present case, embittered with certain
circumstances, which being mixed with sweeter ingredients, tended
altogether to compose a draught that might be termed bitter-sweet;
than which, as nothing can be more disagreeable to the palate, so
nothing, in the metaphorical sense, can be so injurious to the mind.

For first, though he had sufficient foundation to flatter himself in
what he had observed in Sophia, he was not yet free from doubt of
misconstruing compassion, or at best, esteem, into a warmer regard. He
was far from a sanguine assurance that Sophia had any such affection
towards him, as might promise his inclinations that harvest, which, if
they were encouraged and nursed, they would finally grow up to
require. Besides, if he could hope to find no bar to his happiness
from the daughter, he thought himself certain of meeting an effectual
bar in the father; who, though he was a country squire in his
diversions, was perfectly a man of the world in whatever regarded his
fortune; had the most violent affection for his only daughter, and had
often signified, in his cups, the pleasure he proposed in seeing her
married to one of the richest men in the county. Jones was not so vain
and senseless a coxcomb as to expect, from any regard which Western
had professed for him, that he would ever be induced to lay aside
these views of advancing his daughter. He well knew that fortune is
generally the principal, if not the sole, consideration, which
operates on the best of parents in these matters: for friendship makes
us warmly espouse the interest of others; but it is very cold to the
gratification of their passions. Indeed, to feel the happiness which
may result from this, it is necessary we should possess the passion
ourselves. As he had therefore no hopes of obtaining her father's
consent; so he thought to endeavour to succeed without it, and by such
means to frustrate the great point of Mr Western's life, was to make a
very ill use of his hospitality, and a very ungrateful return to the
many little favours received (however roughly) at his hands. If he saw
such a consequence with horror and disdain, how much more was he
shocked with what regarded Mr Allworthy; to whom, as he had more than
filial obligations, so had he for him more than filial piety! He knew
the nature of that good man to be so averse to any baseness or
treachery, that the least attempt of such a kind would make the sight
of the guilty person for ever odious to his eyes, and his name a
detestable sound in his ears. The appearance of such unsurmountable
difficulties was sufficient to have inspired him with despair, however
ardent his wishes had been; but even these were contruoled by
compassion for another woman. The idea of lovely Molly now intruded
itself before him. He had sworn eternal constancy in her arms, and she
had as often vowed never to out-live his deserting her. He now saw her
in all the most shocking postures of death; nay, he considered all the
miseries of prostitution to which she would be liable, and of which he
would be doubly the occasion; first by seducing, and then by deserting
her; for he well knew the hatred which all her neighbours, and even
her own sisters, bore her, and how ready they would all be to tear her
to pieces. Indeed, he had exposed her to more envy than shame, or
rather to the latter by means of the former: for many women abused her
for being a whore, while they envied her her lover, and her finery,
and would have been themselves glad to have purchased these at the
same rate. The ruin, therefore, of the poor girl must, he foresaw,
unavoidably attend his deserting her; and this thought stung him to
the soul. Poverty and distress seemed to him to give none a right of
aggravating those misfortunes. The meanness of her condition did not
represent her misery as of little consequence in his eyes, nor did it
appear to justify, or even to palliate, his guilt, in bringing that
misery upon her. But why do I mention justification? His own heart
would not suffer him to destroy a human creature who, he thought,
loved him, and had to that love sacrificed her innocence. His own good
heart pleaded her cause; not as a cold venal advocate, but as one
interested in the event, and which must itself deeply share in all the
agonies its owner brought on another.

When this powerful advocate had sufficiently raised the pity of Jones,
by painting poor Molly in all the circumstances of wretchedness; it
artfully called in the assistance of another passion, and represented
the girl in all the amiable colours of youth, health, and beauty; as
one greatly the object of desire, and much more so, at least to a good
mind, from being, at the same time, the object of compassion.

Amidst these thoughts, poor Jones passed a long sleepless night, and
in the morning the result of the whole was to abide by Molly, and to
think no more of Sophia.

In this virtuous resolution he continued all the next day till the
evening, cherishing the idea of Molly, and driving Sophia from his
thoughts; but in the fatal evening, a very trifling accident set all
his passions again on float, and worked so total a change in his mind,
that we think it decent to communicate it in a fresh chapter.



Chapter iv.

A little chapter, in which is contained a little incident.


Among other visitants, who paid their compliments to the young
gentleman in his confinement, Mrs Honour was one. The reader, perhaps,
when he reflects on some expressions which have formerly dropt from
her, may conceive that she herself had a very particular affection for
Mr Jones; but, in reality, it was no such thing. Tom was a handsome
young fellow; and for that species of men Mrs Honour had some regard;
but this was perfectly indiscriminate; for having being crossed in the
love which she bore a certain nobleman's footman, who had basely
deserted her after a promise of marriage, she had so securely kept
together the broken remains of her heart, that no man had ever since
been able to possess himself of any single fragment. She viewed all
handsome men with that equal regard and benevolence which a sober and
virtuous mind bears to all the good. She might indeed be called a
lover of men, as Socrates was a lover of mankind, preferring one to
another for corporeal, as he for mental qualifications; but never
carrying this preference so far as to cause any perturbation in the
philosophical serenity of her temper.

The day after Mr Jones had that conflict with himself which we have
seen in the preceding chapter, Mrs Honour came into his room, and
finding him alone, began in the following manner:--"La, sir, where do
you think I have been? I warrants you, you would not guess in fifty
years; but if you did guess, to be sure I must not tell you
neither."--"Nay, if it be something which you must not tell me," said
Jones, "I shall have the curiosity to enquire, and I know you will not
be so barbarous to refuse me."--"I don't know," cries she, "why I
should refuse you neither, for that matter; for to be sure you won't
mention it any more. And for that matter, if you knew where I have
been, unless you knew what I have been about, it would not signify
much. Nay, I don't see why it should be kept a secret for my part; for
to be sure she is the best lady in the world." Upon this, Jones began
to beg earnestly to be let into this secret, and faithfully promised
not to divulge it. She then proceeded thus:--"Why, you must know, sir,
my young lady sent me to enquire after Molly Seagrim, and to see
whether the wench wanted anything; to be sure, I did not care to go,
methinks; but servants must do what they are ordered.--How could you
undervalue yourself so, Mr Jones?--So my lady bid me go and carry her
some linen, and other things. She is too good. If such forward sluts
were sent to Bridewell, it would be better for them. I told my lady,
says I, madam, your la'ship is encouraging idleness."--"And was my
Sophia so good?" says Jones. "My Sophia! I assure you, marry come up,"
answered Honour. "And yet if you knew all--indeed, if I was as Mr
Jones, I should look a little higher than such trumpery as Molly
Seagrim." "What do you mean by these words," replied Jones, "if I knew
all?" "I mean what I mean," says Honour. "Don't you remember putting
your hands in my lady's muff once? I vow I could almost find in my
heart to tell, if I was certain my lady would never come to the
hearing on't." Jones then made several solemn protestations. And
Honour proceeded--"Then to be sure, my lady gave me that muff; and
afterwards, upon hearing what you had done"--"Then you told her what I
had done?" interrupted Jones. "If I did, sir," answered she, "you need
not be angry with me. Many's the man would have given his head to have
had my lady told, if they had known,--for, to be sure, the biggest
lord in the land might be proud--but, I protest, I have a great mind
not to tell you." Jones fell to entreaties, and soon prevailed on her
to go on thus. "You must know then, sir, that my lady had given this
muff to me; but about a day or two after I had told her the story, she
quarrels with her new muff, and to be sure it is the prettiest that
ever was seen. Honour, says she, this is an odious muff; it is too big
for me, I can't wear it: till I can get another, you must let me have
my old one again, and you may have this in the room on't--for she's a
good lady, and scorns to give a thing and take a thing, I promise you
that. So to be sure I fetched it her back again, and, I believe, she
hath worn it upon her arm almost ever since, and I warrants hath given
it many a kiss when nobody hath seen her."

Here the conversation was interrupted by Mr Western himself, who came
to summon Jones to the harpsichord; whither the poor young fellow went
all pale and trembling. This Western observed, but, on seeing Mrs
Honour, imputed it to a wrong cause; and having given Jones a hearty
curse between jest and earnest, he bid him beat abroad, and not poach
up the game in his warren.

Sophia looked this evening with more than usual beauty, and we may
believe it was no small addition to her charms, in the eye of Mr
Jones, that she now happened to have on her right arm this very muff.

She was playing one of her father's favourite tunes, and he was
leaning on her chair, when the muff fell over her fingers, and put her
out. This so disconcerted the squire, that he snatched the muff from
her, and with a hearty curse threw it into the fire. Sophia instantly
started up, and with the utmost eagerness recovered it from the
flames.

Though this incident will probably appear of little consequence to
many of our readers; yet, trifling as it was, it had so violent an
effect on poor Jones, that we thought it our duty to relate it. In
reality, there are many little circumstances too often omitted by
injudicious historians, from which events of the utmost importance
arise. The world may indeed be considered as a vast machine, in which
the great wheels are originally set in motion by those which are very
minute, and almost imperceptible to any but the strongest eyes.

Thus, not all the charms of the incomparable Sophia; not all the
dazzling brightness, and languishing softness of her eyes; the harmony
of her voice, and of her person; not all her wit, good-humour,
greatness of mind, or sweetness of disposition, had been able so
absolutely to conquer and enslave the heart of poor Jones, as this
little incident of the muff. Thus the poet sweetly sings of Troy--

      _--Captique dolis lachrymisque coacti
      Quos neque Tydides, nec Larissaeus Achilles,
      Non anni domuere decem, non mille Carinae._

      What Diomede or Thetis' greater son,
      A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege had done
      False tears and fawning words the city won.

The citadel of Jones was now taken by surprize. All those
considerations of honour and prudence which our heroe had lately with
so much military wisdom placed as guards over the avenues of his
heart, ran away from their posts, and the god of love marched in, in
triumph.



Chapter v.

A very long chapter, containing a very great incident.


But though this victorious deity easily expelled his avowed enemies
from the heart of Jones, he found it more difficult to supplant the
garrison which he himself had placed there. To lay aside all allegory,
the concern for what must become of poor Molly greatly disturbed and
perplexed the mind of the worthy youth. The superior merit of Sophia
totally eclipsed, or rather extinguished, all the beauties of the poor
girl; but compassion instead of contempt succeeded to love. He was
convinced the girl had placed all her affections, and all her prospect
of future happiness, in him only. For this he had, he knew, given
sufficient occasion, by the utmost profusion of tenderness towards
her: a tenderness which he had taken every means to persuade her he
would always maintain. She, on her side, had assured him of her firm
belief in his promise, and had with the most solemn vows declared,
that on his fulfilling or breaking these promises, it depended,
whether she should be the happiest or most miserable of womankind. And
to be the author of this highest degree of misery to a human being,
was a thought on which he could not bear to ruminate a single moment.
He considered this poor girl as having sacrificed to him everything in
her little power; as having been at her own expense the object of his
pleasure; as sighing and languishing for him even at that very
instant. Shall then, says he, my recovery, for which she hath so
ardently wished; shall my presence, which she hath so eagerly
expected, instead of giving her that joy with which she hath flattered
herself, cast her at once down into misery and despair? Can I be such
a villain? Here, when the genius of poor Molly seemed triumphant, the
love of Sophia towards him, which now appeared no longer dubious,
rushed upon his mind, and bore away every obstacle before it.

At length it occurred to him, that he might possibly be able to make
Molly amends another way; namely, by giving her a sum of money. This,
nevertheless, he almost despaired of her accepting, when he
recollected the frequent and vehement assurances he had received from
her, that the world put in balance with him would make her no amends
for his loss. However, her extreme poverty, and chiefly her egregious
vanity (somewhat of which hath been already hinted to the reader),
gave him some little hope, that, notwithstanding all her avowed
tenderness, she might in time be brought to content herself with a
fortune superior to her expectation, and which might indulge her
vanity, by setting her above all her equals. He resolved therefore to
take the first opportunity of making a proposal of this kind.

One day, accordingly, when his arm was so well recovered that he could
walk easily with it slung in a sash, he stole forth, at a season when
the squire was engaged in his field exercises, and visited his fair
one. Her mother and sisters, whom he found taking their tea, informed
him first that Molly was not at home; but afterwards the eldest sister
acquainted him, with a malicious smile, that she was above stairs
a-bed. Tom had no objection to this situation of his mistress, and
immediately ascended the ladder which led towards her bed-chamber; but
when he came to the top, he, to his great surprize, found the door
fast; nor could he for some time obtain any answer from within; for
Molly, as she herself afterwards informed him, was fast asleep.

The extremes of grief and joy have been remarked to produce very
similar effects; and when either of these rushes on us by surprize, it
is apt to create such a total perturbation and confusion, that we are
often thereby deprived of the use of all our faculties. It cannot
therefore be wondered at, that the unexpected sight of Mr Jones should
so strongly operate on the mind of Molly, and should overwhelm her
with such confusion, that for some minutes she was unable to express
the great raptures, with which the reader will suppose she was
affected on this occasion. As for Jones, he was so entirely possessed,
and as it were enchanted, by the presence of his beloved object, that
he for a while forgot Sophia, and consequently the principal purpose
of his visit.

This, however, soon recurred to his memory; and after the first
transports of their meeting were over, he found means by degrees to
introduce a discourse on the fatal consequences which must attend
their amour, if Mr Allworthy, who had strictly forbidden him ever
seeing her more, should discover that he still carried on this
commerce. Such a discovery, which his enemies gave him reason to think
would be unavoidable, must, he said, end in his ruin, and consequently
in hers. Since therefore their hard fates had determined that they
must separate, he advised her to bear it with resolution, and swore he
would never omit any opportunity, through the course of his life, of
showing her the sincerity of his affection, by providing for her in a
manner beyond her utmost expectation, or even beyond her wishes, if
ever that should be in his power; concluding at last, that she might
soon find some man who would marry her, and who would make her much
happier than she could be by leading a disreputable life with him.

Molly remained a few moments in silence, and then bursting into a
flood of tears, she began to upbraid him in the following words: "And
this is your love for me, to forsake me in this manner, now you have
ruined me! How often, when I have told you that all men are false and
perjury alike, and grow tired of us as soon as ever they have had
their wicked wills of us, how often have you sworn you would never
forsake me! And can you be such a perjury man after all? What
signifies all the riches in the world to me without you, now you have
gained my heart, so you have--you have--? Why do you mention another
man to me? I can never love any other man as long as I live. All other
men are nothing to me. If the greatest squire in all the country would
come a suiting to me to-morrow, I would not give my company to him.
No, I shall always hate and despise the whole sex for your sake."--

She was proceeding thus, when an accident put a stop to her tongue,
before it had run out half its career. The room, or rather garret, in
which Molly lay, being up one pair of stairs, that is to say, at the
top of the house, was of a sloping figure, resembling the great Delta
of the Greeks. The English reader may perhaps form a better idea of
it, by being told that it was impossible to stand upright anywhere but
in the middle. Now, as this room wanted the conveniency of a closet,
Molly had, to supply that defect, nailed up an old rug against the
rafters of the house, which enclosed a little hole where her best
apparel, such as the remains of that sack which we have formerly
mentioned, some caps, and other things with which she had lately
provided herself, were hung up and secured from the dust.

This enclosed place exactly fronted the foot of the bed, to which,
indeed, the rug hung so near, that it served in a manner to supply the
want of curtains. Now, whether Molly, in the agonies of her rage,
pushed this rug with her feet; or Jones might touch it; or whether the
pin or nail gave way of its own accord, I am not certain; but as Molly
pronounced those last words, which are recorded above, the wicked rug
got loose from its fastening, and discovered everything hid behind it;
where among other female utensils appeared--(with shame I write it,
and with sorrow will it be read)--the philosopher Square, in a posture
(for the place would not near admit his standing upright) as
ridiculous as can possibly be conceived.

The posture, indeed, in which he stood, was not greatly unlike that of
a soldier who is tied neck and heels; or rather resembling the
attitude in which we often see fellows in the public streets of
London, who are not suffering but deserving punishment by so standing.
He had a nightcap belonging to Molly on his head, and his two large
eyes, the moment the rug fell, stared directly at Jones; so that when
the idea of philosophy was added to the figure now discovered, it
would have been very difficult for any spectator to have refrained
from immoderate laughter.

I question not but the surprize of the reader will be here equal to
that of Jones; as the suspicions which must arise from the appearance
of this wise and grave man in such a place, may seem so inconsistent
with that character which he hath, doubtless, maintained hitherto, in
the opinion of every one.

But to confess the truth, this inconsistency is rather imaginary than
real. Philosophers are composed of flesh and blood as well as other
human creatures; and however sublimated and refined the theory of
these may be, a little practical frailty is as incident to them as to
other mortals. It is, indeed, in theory only, and not in practice, as
we have before hinted, that consists the difference: for though such
great beings think much better and more wisely, they always act
exactly like other men. They know very well how to subdue all
appetites and passions, and to despise both pain and pleasure; and
this knowledge affords much delightful contemplation, and is easily
acquired; but the practice would be vexatious and troublesome; and,
therefore, the same wisdom which teaches them to know this, teaches
them to avoid carrying it into execution.

Mr Square happened to be at church on that Sunday, when, as the reader
may be pleased to remember, the appearance of Molly in her sack had
caused all that disturbance. Here he first observed her, and was so
pleased with her beauty, that he prevailed with the young gentlemen to
change their intended ride that evening, that he might pass by the
habitation of Molly, and by that means might obtain a second chance of
seeing her. This reason, however, as he did not at that time mention
to any, so neither did we think proper to communicate it then to the
reader.

Among other particulars which constituted the unfitness of things in
Mr Square's opinion, danger and difficulty were two. The difficulty
therefore which he apprehended there might be in corrupting this young
wench, and the danger which would accrue to his character on the
discovery, were such strong dissuasives, that it is probable he at
first intended to have contented himself with the pleasing ideas which
the sight of beauty furnishes us with. These the gravest men, after a
full meal of serious meditation, often allow themselves by way of
dessert: for which purpose, certain books and pictures find their way
into the most private recesses of their study, and a certain liquorish
part of natural philosophy is often the principal subject of their
conversation.

But when the philosopher heard, a day or two afterwards, that the
fortress of virtue had already been subdued, he began to give a larger
scope to his desires. His appetite was not of that squeamish kind
which cannot feed on a dainty because another hath tasted it. In
short, he liked the girl the better for the want of that chastity,
which, if she had possessed it, must have been a bar to his pleasures;
he pursued and obtained her.

The reader will be mistaken, if he thinks Molly gave Square the
preference to her younger lover: on the contrary, had she been
confined to the choice of one only, Tom Jones would undoubtedly have
been, of the two, the victorious person. Nor was it solely the
consideration that two are better than one (though this had its proper
weight) to which Mr Square owed his success: the absence of Jones
during his confinement was an unlucky circumstance; and in that
interval some well-chosen presents from the philosopher so softened
and unguarded the girl's heart, that a favourable opportunity became
irresistible, and Square triumphed over the poor remains of virtue
which subsisted in the bosom of Molly.

It was now about a fortnight since this conquest, when Jones paid the
above-mentioned visit to his mistress, at a time when she and Square
were in bed together. This was the true reason why the mother denied
her as we have seen; for as the old woman shared in the profits
arising from the iniquity of her daughter, she encouraged and
protected her in it to the utmost of her power; but such was the envy
and hatred which the elder sister bore towards Molly, that,
notwithstanding she had some part of the booty, she would willingly
have parted with this to ruin her sister and spoil her trade. Hence
she had acquainted Jones with her being above-stairs in bed, in hopes
that he might have caught her in Square's arms. This, however, Molly
found means to prevent, as the door was fastened; which gave her an
opportunity of conveying her lover behind that rug or blanket where he
now was unhappily discovered.

Square no sooner made his appearance than Molly flung herself back in
her bed, cried out she was undone, and abandoned herself to despair.
This poor girl, who was yet but a novice in her business, had not
arrived to that perfection of assurance which helps off a town lady in
any extremity; and either prompts her with an excuse, or else inspires
her to brazen out the matter with her husband, who, from love of
quiet, or out of fear of his reputation--and sometimes, perhaps, from
fear of the gallant, who, like Mr Constant in the play, wears a
sword--is glad to shut his eyes, and content to put his horns in his
pocket. Molly, on the contrary, was silenced by this evidence, and
very fairly gave up a cause which she had hitherto maintained with so
many tears, and with such solemn and vehement protestations of the
purest love and constancy.

As to the gentleman behind the arras, he was not in much less
consternation. He stood for a while motionless, and seemed equally at
a loss what to say, or whither to direct his eyes. Jones, though
perhaps the most astonished of the three, first found his tongue; and
being immediately recovered from those uneasy sensations which Molly
by her upbraidings had occasioned, he burst into a loud laughter, and
then saluting Mr Square, advanced to take him by the hand, and to
relieve him from his place of confinement.

Square being now arrived in the middle of the room, in which part only
he could stand upright, looked at Jones with a very grave countenance,
and said to him, "Well, sir, I see you enjoy this mighty discovery,
and, I dare swear, take great delight in the thoughts of exposing me;
but if you will consider the matter fairly, you will find you are
yourself only to blame. I am not guilty of corrupting innocence. I
have done nothing for which that part of the world which judges of
matters by the rule of right, will condemn me. Fitness is governed by
the nature of things, and not by customs, forms, or municipal laws.
Nothing is indeed unfit which is not unnatural."--"Well reasoned, old
boy," answered Jones; "but why dost thou think that I should desire to
expose thee? I promise thee, I was never better pleased with thee in
my life; and unless thou hast a mind to discover it thyself, this
affair may remain a profound secret for me."--"Nay, Mr Jones," replied
Square, "I would not be thought to undervalue reputation. Good fame is
a species of the Kalon, and it is by no means fitting to neglect it.
Besides, to murder one's own reputation is a kind of suicide, a
detestable and odious vice. If you think proper, therefore, to conceal
any infirmity of mine (for such I may have, since no man is perfectly
perfect), I promise you I will not betray myself. Things may be
fitting to be done, which are not fitting to be boasted of; for
by the perverse judgment of the world, that often becomes the
subject of censure, which is, in truth, not only innocent but
laudable."--"Right!" cries Jones: "what can be more innocent than the
indulgence of a natural appetite? or what more laudable than the
propagation of our species?"--"To be serious with you," answered
Square, "I profess they always appeared so to me."--"And yet," said
Jones, "you was of a different opinion when my affair with this girl
was first discovered."--"Why, I must confess," says Square, "as the
matter was misrepresented to me, by that parson Thwackum, I might
condemn the corruption of innocence: it was that, sir, it was
that--and that--: for you must know, Mr Jones, in the consideration of
fitness, very minute circumstances, sir, very minute circumstances
cause great alteration."--"Well," cries Jones, "be that as it will, it
shall be your own fault, as I have promised you, if you ever hear any
more of this adventure. Behave kindly to the girl, and I will never
open my lips concerning the matter to any one. And, Molly, do you be
faithful to your friend, and I will not only forgive your infidelity
to me, but will do you all the service I can." So saying, he took a
hasty leave, and, slipping down the ladder, retired with much
expedition.

Square was rejoiced to find this adventure was likely to have no worse
conclusion; and as for Molly, being recovered from her confusion, she
began at first to upbraid Square with having been the occasion of her
loss of Jones; but that gentleman soon found the means of mitigating
her anger, partly by caresses, and partly by a small nostrum from his
purse, of wonderful and approved efficacy in purging off the ill
humours of the mind, and in restoring it to a good temper.

She then poured forth a vast profusion of tenderness towards her new
lover; turned all she had said to Jones, and Jones himself, into
ridicule; and vowed, though he once had the possession of her person,
that none but Square had ever been master of her heart.



Chapter vi.

By comparing which with the former, the reader may possibly correct
some abuse which he hath formerly been guilty of in the application of
the word love.


The infidelity of Molly, which Jones had now discovered, would,
perhaps, have vindicated a much greater degree of resentment than he
expressed on the occasion; and if he had abandoned her directly from
that moment, very few, I believe, would have blamed him.

Certain, however, it is, that he saw her in the light of compassion;
and though his love to her was not of that kind which could give him
any great uneasiness at her inconstancy, yet was he not a little
shocked on reflecting that he had himself originally corrupted her
innocence; for to this corruption he imputed all the vice into which
she appeared now so likely to plunge herself.

This consideration gave him no little uneasiness, till Betty, the
elder sister, was so kind, some time afterwards, entirely to cure him
by a hint, that one Will Barnes, and not himself, had been the first
seducer of Molly; and that the little child, which he had hitherto so
certainly concluded to be his own, might very probably have an equal
title, at least, to claim Barnes for its father.

Jones eagerly pursued this scent when he had first received it; and in
a very short time was sufficiently assured that the girl had told him
truth, not only by the confession of the fellow, but at last by that
of Molly herself.

This Will Barnes was a country gallant, and had acquired as many
trophies of this kind as any ensign or attorney's clerk in the
kingdom. He had, indeed, reduced several women to a state of utter
profligacy, had broke the hearts of some, and had the honour of
occasioning the violent death of one poor girl, who had either drowned
herself, or, what was rather more probable, had been drowned by him.

Among other of his conquests, this fellow had triumphed over the heart
of Betty Seagrim. He had made love to her long before Molly was grown
to be a fit object of that pastime; but had afterwards deserted her,
and applied to her sister, with whom he had almost immediate success.
Now Will had, in reality, the sole possession of Molly's affection,
while Jones and Square were almost equally sacrifices to her interest
and to her pride.

Hence had grown that implacable hatred which we have before seen
raging in the mind of Betty; though we did not think it necessary to
assign this cause sooner, as envy itself alone was adequate to all the
effects we have mentioned.

Jones was become perfectly easy by possession of this secret with
regard to Molly; but as to Sophia, he was far from being in a state of
tranquillity; nay, indeed, he was under the most violent perturbation;
his heart was now, if I may use the metaphor, entirely evacuated, and
Sophia took absolute possession of it. He loved her with an unbounded
passion, and plainly saw the tender sentiments she had for him; yet
could not this assurance lessen his despair of obtaining the consent
of her father, nor the horrors which attended his pursuit of her by
any base or treacherous method.

The injury which he must thus do to Mr Western, and the concern which
would accrue to Mr Allworthy, were circumstances that tormented him
all day, and haunted him on his pillow at night. His life was a
constant struggle between honour and inclination, which alternately
triumphed over each other in his mind. He often resolved, in the
absence of Sophia, to leave her father's house, and to see her no
more; and as often, in her presence, forgot all those resolutions, and
determined to pursue her at the hazard of his life, and at the
forfeiture of what was much dearer to him.

This conflict began soon to produce very strong and visible effects:
for he lost all his usual sprightliness and gaiety of temper, and
became not only melancholy when alone, but dejected and absent in
company; nay, if ever he put on a forced mirth, to comply with Mr
Western's humour, the constraint appeared so plain, that he seemed to
have been giving the strongest evidence of what he endeavoured to
conceal by such ostentation.

It may, perhaps, be a question, whether the art which he used to
conceal his passion, or the means which honest nature employed to
reveal it, betrayed him most: for while art made him more than ever
reserved to Sophia, and forbad him to address any of his discourse to
her, nay, to avoid meeting her eyes, with the utmost caution; nature
was no less busy in counterplotting him. Hence, at the approach of the
young lady, he grew pale; and if this was sudden, started. If his eyes
accidentally met hers, the blood rushed into his cheeks, and his
countenance became all over scarlet. If common civility ever obliged
him to speak to her, as to drink her health at table, his tongue was
sure to falter. If he touched her, his hand, nay his whole frame,
trembled. And if any discourse tended, however remotely, to raise the
idea of love, an involuntary sigh seldom failed to steal from his
bosom. Most of which accidents nature was wonderfully industrious to
throw daily in his way.

All these symptoms escaped the notice of the squire: but not so of
Sophia. She soon perceived these agitations of mind in Jones, and was
at no loss to discover the cause; for indeed she recognized it in her
own breast. And this recognition is, I suppose, that sympathy which
hath been so often noted in lovers, and which will sufficiently
account for her being so much quicker-sighted than her father.

But, to say the truth, there is a more simple and plain method of
accounting for that prodigious superiority of penetration which we
must observe in some men over the rest of the human species, and one
which will serve not only in the case of lovers, but of all others.
From whence is it that the knave is generally so quick-sighted to
those symptoms and operations of knavery, which often dupe an honest
man of a much better understanding? There surely is no general
sympathy among knaves; nor have they, like freemasons, any common sign
of communication. In reality, it is only because they have the same
thing in their heads, and their thoughts are turned the same way.
Thus, that Sophia saw, and that Western did not see, the plain
symptoms of love in Jones can be no wonder, when we consider that the
idea of love never entered into the head of the father, whereas the
daughter, at present, thought of nothing else.

When Sophia was well satisfied of the violent passion which tormented
poor Jones, and no less certain that she herself was its object, she
had not the least difficulty in discovering the true cause of his
present behaviour. This highly endeared him to her, and raised in her
mind two of the best affections which any lover can wish to raise in a
mistress--these were, esteem and pity--for sure the most outrageously
rigid among her sex will excuse her pitying a man whom she saw
miserable on her own account; nor can they blame her for esteeming one
who visibly, from the most honourable motives, endeavoured to smother
a flame in his own bosom, which, like the famous Spartan theft, was
preying upon and consuming his very vitals. Thus his backwardness, his
shunning her, his coldness, and his silence, were the forwardest, the
most diligent, the warmest, and most eloquent advocates; and wrought
so violently on her sensible and tender heart, that she soon felt for
him all those gentle sensations which are consistent with a virtuous
and elevated female mind. In short, all which esteem, gratitude, and
pity, can inspire in such towards an agreeable man--indeed, all which
the nicest delicacy can allow. In a word, she was in love with him to
distraction.

One day this young couple accidentally met in the garden, at the end
of the two walks which were both bounded by that canal in which Jones
had formerly risqued drowning to retrieve the little bird that Sophia
had there lost.

This place had been of late much frequented by Sophia. Here she used
to ruminate, with a mixture of pain and pleasure, on an incident
which, however trifling in itself, had possibly sown the first seeds
of that affection which was now arrived to such maturity in her heart.

Here then this young couple met. They were almost close together
before either of them knew anything of the other's approach. A
bystander would have discovered sufficient marks of confusion in the
countenance of each; but they felt too much themselves to make any
observation. As soon as Jones had a little recovered his first
surprize, he accosted the young lady with some of the ordinary forms
of salutation, which she in the same manner returned; and their
conversation began, as usual, on the delicious beauty of the morning.
Hence they past to the beauty of the place, on which Jones launched
forth very high encomiums. When they came to the tree whence he had
formerly tumbled into the canal, Sophia could not help reminding him
of that accident, and said, "I fancy, Mr Jones, you have some little
shuddering when you see that water."--"I assure you, madam," answered
Jones, "the concern you felt at the loss of your little bird will
always appear to me the highest circumstance in that adventure. Poor
little Tommy! there is the branch he stood upon. How could the little
wretch have the folly to fly away from that state of happiness in
which I had the honour to place him? His fate was a just punishment
for his ingratitude."--"Upon my word, Mr Jones," said she, "your
gallantry very narrowly escaped as severe a fate. Sure the remembrance
must affect you."--"Indeed, madam," answered he, "if I have any reason
to reflect with sorrow on it, it is, perhaps, that the water had not
been a little deeper, by which I might have escaped many bitter
heart-aches that Fortune seems to have in store for me."--"Fie, Mr
Jones!" replied Sophia; "I am sure you cannot be in earnest now. This
affected contempt of life is only an excess of your complacence to me.
You would endeavour to lessen the obligation of having twice ventured
it for my sake. Beware the third time." She spoke these last words
with a smile, and a softness inexpressible. Jones answered with a
sigh, "He feared it was already too late for caution:" and then
looking tenderly and stedfastly on her, he cried, "Oh, Miss Western!
can you desire me to live? Can you wish me so ill?" Sophia, looking
down on the ground, answered with some hesitation, "Indeed, Mr Jones,
I do not wish you ill."--"Oh, I know too well that heavenly temper,"
cries Jones, "that divine goodness, which is beyond every other
charm."--"Nay, now," answered she, "I understand you not. I can stay
no longer."--"I--I would not be understood!" cries he; "nay, I can't
be understood. I know not what I say. Meeting you here so
unexpectedly, I have been unguarded: for Heaven's sake pardon me, if I
have said anything to offend you. I did not mean it. Indeed, I would
rather have died--nay, the very thought would kill me."--"You surprize
me," answered she. "How can you possibly think you have offended
me?"--"Fear, madam," says he, "easily runs into madness; and there is
no degree of fear like that which I feel of offending you. How can I
speak then? Nay, don't look angrily at me: one frown will destroy me.
I mean nothing. Blame my eyes, or blame those beauties. What am I
saying? Pardon me if I have said too much. My heart overflowed. I have
struggled with my love to the utmost, and have endeavoured to conceal
a fever which preys on my vitals, and will, I hope, soon make it
impossible for me ever to offend you more."

Mr Jones now fell a trembling as if he had been shaken with the fit of
an ague. Sophia, who was in a situation not very different from his,
answered in these words: "Mr Jones, I will not affect to misunderstand
you; indeed, I understand you too well; but, for Heaven's sake, if you
have any affection for me, let me make the best of my way into the
house. I wish I may be able to support myself thither."

Jones, who was hardly able to support himself, offered her his arm,
which she condescended to accept, but begged he would not mention a
word more to her of this nature at present. He promised he would not;
insisting only on her forgiveness of what love, without the leave of
his will, had forced from him: this, she told him, he knew how to
obtain by his future behaviour; and thus this young pair tottered and
trembled along, the lover not once daring to squeeze the hand of his
mistress, though it was locked in his.

Sophia immediately retired to her chamber, where Mrs Honour and the
hartshorn were summoned to her assistance. As to poor Jones, the only
relief to his distempered mind was an unwelcome piece of news, which,
as it opens a scene of different nature from those in which the reader
hath lately been conversant, will be communicated to him in the next
chapter.



Chapter vii.

In which Mr Allworthy appears on a sick-bed.


Mr Western was become so fond of Jones that he was unwilling to part
with him, though his arm had been long since cured; and Jones, either
from the love of sport, or from some other reason, was easily
persuaded to continue at his house, which he did sometimes for a
fortnight together without paying a single visit at Mr Allworthy's;
nay, without ever hearing from thence.

Mr Allworthy had been for some days indisposed with a cold, which had
been attended with a little fever. This he had, however, neglected; as
it was usual with him to do all manner of disorders which did not
confine him to his bed, or prevent his several faculties from
performing their ordinary functions;--a conduct which we would by no
means be thought to approve or recommend to imitation; for surely the
gentlemen of the Aesculapian art are in the right in advising, that
the moment the disease has entered at one door, the physician should
be introduced at the other: what else is meant by that old adage,
_Venienti occurrite morbo?_ "Oppose a distemper at its first
approach." Thus the doctor and the disease meet in fair and equal
conflict; whereas, by giving time to the latter, we often suffer him
to fortify and entrench himself, like a French army; so that the
learned gentleman finds it very difficult, and sometimes impossible,
to come at the enemy. Nay, sometimes by gaining time the disease
applies to the French military politics, and corrupts nature over to
his side, and then all the powers of physic must arrive too late.
Agreeable to these observations was, I remember, the complaint of the
great Doctor Misaubin, who used very pathetically to lament the late
applications which were made to his skill, saying, "Bygar, me believe
my pation take me for de undertaker, for dey never send for me till de
physicion have kill dem."

Mr Allworthy's distemper, by means of this neglect, gained such
ground, that, when the increase of his fever obliged him to send for
assistance, the doctor at his first arrival shook his head, wished he
had been sent for sooner, and intimated that he thought him in very
imminent danger. Mr Allworthy, who had settled all his affairs in this
world, and was as well prepared as it is possible for human nature to
be for the other, received this information with the utmost calmness
and unconcern. He could, indeed, whenever he laid himself down to
rest, say with Cato in the tragical poem--

                               Let guilt or fear
     Disturb man's rest: Cato knows neither of them;
     Indifferent in his choice to sleep or die.

In reality, he could say this with ten times more reason and
confidence than Cato, or any other proud fellow among the antient or
modern heroes; for he was not only devoid of fear, but might be
considered as a faithful labourer, when at the end of harvest he is
summoned to receive his reward at the hands of a bountiful master.

The good man gave immediate orders for all his family to be summoned
round him. None of these were then abroad, but Mrs Blifil, who had
been some time in London, and Mr Jones, whom the reader hath just
parted from at Mr Western's, and who received this summons just as
Sophia had left him.

The news of Mr Allworthy's danger (for the servant told him he was
dying) drove all thoughts of love out of his head. He hurried
instantly into the chariot which was sent for him, and ordered the
coachman to drive with all imaginable haste; nor did the idea of
Sophia, I believe, once occur to him on the way.

And now the whole family, namely, Mr Blifil, Mr Jones, Mr Thwackum, Mr
Square, and some of the servants (for such were Mr Allworthy's orders)
being all assembled round his bed, the good man sat up in it, and was
beginning to speak, when Blifil fell to blubbering, and began to
express very loud and bitter lamentations. Upon this Mr Allworthy
shook him by the hand, and said, "Do not sorrow thus, my dear nephew,
at the most ordinary of all human occurrences. When misfortunes befal
our friends we are justly grieved; for those are accidents which might
often have been avoided, and which may seem to render the lot of one
man more peculiarly unhappy than that of others; but death is
certainly unavoidable, and is that common lot in which alone the
fortunes of all men agree: nor is the time when this happens to us
very material. If the wisest of men hath compared life to a span,
surely we may be allowed to consider it as a day. It is my fate to
leave it in the evening; but those who are taken away earlier have
only lost a few hours, at the best little worth lamenting, and much
oftener hours of labour and fatigue, of pain and sorrow. One of the
Roman poets, I remember, likens our leaving life to our departure from
a feast;--a thought which hath often occurred to me when I have seen
men struggling to protract an entertainment, and to enjoy the company
of their friends a few moments longer. Alas! how short is the most
protracted of such enjoyments! how immaterial the difference between
him who retires the soonest, and him who stays the latest! This is
seeing life in the best view, and this unwillingness to quit our
friends is the most amiable motive from which we can derive the fear
of death; and yet the longest enjoyment which we can hope for of this
kind is of so trivial a duration, that it is to a wise man truly
contemptible. Few men, I own, think in this manner; for, indeed, few
men think of death till they are in its jaws. However gigantic and
terrible an object this may appear when it approaches them, they are
nevertheless incapable of seeing it at any distance; nay, though they
have been ever so much alarmed and frightened when they have
apprehended themselves in danger of dying, they are no sooner cleared
from this apprehension than even the fears of it are erased from their
minds. But, alas! he who escapes from death is not pardoned; he is
only reprieved, and reprieved to a short day.

"Grieve, therefore, no more, my dear child, on this occasion: an event
which may happen every hour; which every element, nay, almost every
particle of matter that surrounds us is capable of producing, and
which must and will most unavoidably reach us all at last, ought
neither to occasion our surprize nor our lamentation.

"My physician having acquainted me (which I take very kindly of him)
that I am in danger of leaving you all very shortly, I have determined
to say a few words to you at this our parting, before my distemper,
which I find grows very fast upon me, puts it out of my power.

"But I shall waste my strength too much. I intended to speak
concerning my will, which, though I have settled long ago, I think
proper to mention such heads of it as concern any of you, that I may
have the comfort of perceiving you are all satisfied with the
provision I have there made for you.

"Nephew Blifil, I leave you the heir to my whole estate, except only
£500 a-year, which is to revert to you after the death of your mother,
and except one other estate of £500 a-year, and the sum of £6000,
which I have bestowed in the following manner:

"The estate of £500 a-year I have given to you, Mr Jones: and as I
know the inconvenience which attends the want of ready money, I have
added £1000 in specie. In this I know not whether I have exceeded or
fallen short of your expectation. Perhaps you will think I have given
you too little, and the world will be as ready to condemn me for
giving you too much; but the latter censure I despise; and as to the
former, unless you should entertain that common error which I have
often heard in my life pleaded as an excuse for a total want of
charity, namely, that instead of raising gratitude by voluntary acts
of bounty, we are apt to raise demands, which of all others are the
most boundless and most difficult to satisfy.--Pardon me the bare
mention of this; I will not suspect any such thing."

Jones flung himself at his benefactor's feet, and taking eagerly hold
of his hand, assured him his goodness to him, both now and all other
times, had so infinitely exceeded not only his merit but his hopes,
that no words could express his sense of it. "And I assure you, sir,"
said he, "your present generosity hath left me no other concern than
for the present melancholy occasion. Oh, my friend, my father!" Here
his words choaked him, and he turned away to hide a tear which was
starting from his eyes.

Allworthy then gently squeezed his hand, and proceeded thus: "I am
convinced, my child, that you have much goodness, generosity, and
honour, in your temper: if you will add prudence and religion to
these, you must be happy; for the three former qualities, I admit,
make you worthy of happiness, but they are the latter only which will
put you in possession of it.

"One thousand pound I have given to you, Mr Thwackum; a sum I am
convinced which greatly exceeds your desires, as well as your wants.
However, you will receive it as a memorial of my friendship; and
whatever superfluities may redound to you, that piety which you so
rigidly maintain will instruct you how to dispose of them.

"A like sum, Mr Square, I have bequeathed to you. This, I hope, will
enable you to pursue your profession with better success than
hitherto. I have often observed with concern, that distress is more
apt to excite contempt than commiseration, especially among men of
business, with whom poverty is understood to indicate want of ability.
But the little I have been able to leave you will extricate you from
those difficulties with which you have formerly struggled; and then I
doubt not but you will meet with sufficient prosperity to supply what
a man of your philosophical temper will require.

"I find myself growing faint, so I shall refer you to my will for my
disposition of the residue. My servants will there find some tokens to
remember me by; and there are a few charities which, I trust, my
executors will see faithfully performed. Bless you all. I am setting
out a little before you."--

Here a footman came hastily into the room, and said there was an
attorney from Salisbury who had a particular message, which he said he
must communicate to Mr Allworthy himself: that he seemed in a violent
hurry, and protested he had so much business to do, that, if he could
cut himself into four quarters, all would not be sufficient.

"Go, child," said Allworthy to Blifil, "see what the gentleman wants.
I am not able to do any business now, nor can he have any with me, in
which you are not at present more concerned than myself. Besides, I
really am--I am incapable of seeing any one at present, or of any
longer attention." He then saluted them all, saying, perhaps he should
be able to see them again, but he should be now glad to compose
himself a little, finding that he had too much exhausted his spirits
in discourse.

Some of the company shed tears at their parting; and even the
philosopher Square wiped his eyes, albeit unused to the melting mood.
As to Mrs Wilkins, she dropt her pearls as fast as the Arabian trees
their medicinal gums; for this was a ceremonial which that gentlewoman
never omitted on a proper occasion.

After this Mr Allworthy again laid himself down on his pillow, and
endeavoured to compose himself to rest.



Chapter viii.

Containing matter rather natural than pleasing.


Besides grief for her master, there was another source for that briny
stream which so plentifully rose above the two mountainous cheek-bones
of the housekeeper. She was no sooner retired, than she began to
mutter to herself in the following pleasant strain: "Sure master might
have made some difference, methinks, between me and the other
servants. I suppose he hath left me mourning; but, i'fackins! if that
be all, the devil shall wear it for him, for me. I'd have his worship
know I am no beggar. I have saved five hundred pound in his service,
and after all to be used in this manner.--It is a fine encouragement
to servants to be honest; and to be sure, if I have taken a little
something now and then, others have taken ten times as much; and now
we are all put in a lump together. If so be that it be so, the legacy
may go to the devil with him that gave it. No, I won't give it up
neither, because that will please some folks. No, I'll buy the gayest
gown I can get, and dance over the old curmudgeon's grave in it. This
is my reward for taking his part so often, when all the country have
cried shame of him, for breeding up his bastard in that manner; but he
is going now where he must pay for all. It would have become him
better to have repented of his sins on his deathbed, than to glory in
them, and give away his estate out of his own family to a misbegotten
child. Found in his bed, forsooth! a pretty story! ay, ay, those that
hide know where to find. Lord forgive him! I warrant he hath many more
bastards to answer for, if the truth was known. One comfort is, they
will all be known where he is a going now.--`The servants will find
some token to remember me by.' Those were the very words; I shall
never forget them, if I was to live a thousand years. Ay, ay, I shall
remember you for huddling me among the servants. One would have
thought he might have mentioned my name as well as that of Square; but
he is a gentleman forsooth, though he had not cloths on his back when
he came hither first. Marry come up with such gentlemen! though he
hath lived here this many years, I don't believe there is arrow a
servant in the house ever saw the colour of his money. The devil shall
wait upon such a gentleman for me." Much more of the like kind she
muttered to herself; but this taste shall suffice to the reader.

Neither Thwackum nor Square were much better satisfied with their
legacies. Though they breathed not their resentment so loud, yet from
the discontent which appeared in their countenances, as well as from
the following dialogue, we collect that no great pleasure reigned in
their minds.

About an hour after they had left the sick-room, Square met Thwackum
in the hall and accosted him thus: "Well, sir, have you heard any news
of your friend since we parted from him?"--"If you mean Mr Allworthy,"
answered Thwackum, "I think you might rather give him the appellation
of your friend; for he seems to me to have deserved that title."--"The
title is as good on your side," replied Square, "for his bounty, such
as it is, hath been equal to both."--"I should not have mentioned it
first," cries Thwackum, "but since you begin, I must inform you I am
of a different opinion. There is a wide distinction between voluntary
favours and rewards. The duty I have done in his family, and the care
I have taken in the education of his two boys, are services for which
some men might have expected a greater return. I would not have you
imagine I am therefore dissatisfied; for St Paul hath taught me to
be content with the little I have. Had the modicum been less, I
should have known my duty. But though the Scriptures obliges me to
remain contented, it doth not enjoin me to shut my eyes to my own
merit, nor restrain me from seeing when I am injured by an unjust
comparison."--"Since you provoke me," returned Square, "that injury is
done to me; nor did I ever imagine Mr Allworthy had held my friendship
so light, as to put me in balance with one who received his wages. I
know to what it is owing; it proceeds from those narrow principles
which you have been so long endeavouring to infuse into him, in
contempt of everything which is great and noble. The beauty and
loveliness of friendship is too strong for dim eyes, nor can it be
perceived by any other medium than that unerring rule of right, which
you have so often endeavoured to ridicule, that you have perverted
your friend's understanding."--"I wish," cries Thwackum, in a rage, "I
wish, for the sake of his soul, your damnable doctrines have not
perverted his faith. It is to this I impute his present behaviour, so
unbecoming a Christian. Who but an atheist could think of leaving the
world without having first made up his account? without confessing his
sins, and receiving that absolution which he knew he had one in the
house duly authorized to give him? He will feel the want of these
necessaries when it is too late, when he is arrived at that place
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth. It is then he will find
in what mighty stead that heathen goddess, that virtue, which you and
all other deists of the age adore, will stand him. He will then summon
his priest, when there is none to be found, and will lament the want
of that absolution, without which no sinner can be safe."--"If it be
so material," says Square, "why don't you present it him of your own
accord?" "It hath no virtue," cries Thwackum, "but to those who have
sufficient grace to require it. But why do I talk thus to a heathen
and an unbeliever? It is you that taught him this lesson, for which
you have been well rewarded in this world, as I doubt not your
disciple will soon be in the other."--"I know not what you mean by
reward," said Square; "but if you hint at that pitiful memorial of our
friendship, which he hath thought fit to bequeath me, I despise it;
and nothing but the unfortunate situation of my circumstances should
prevail on me to accept it."

The physician now arrived, and began to inquire of the two disputants,
how we all did above-stairs? "In a miserable way," answered Thwackum.
"It is no more than I expected," cries the doctor: "but pray what
symptoms have appeared since I left you?"--"No good ones, I am
afraid," replied Thwackum: "after what past at our departure, I think
there were little hopes." The bodily physician, perhaps, misunderstood
the curer of souls; and before they came to an explanation, Mr Blifil
came to them with a most melancholy countenance, and acquaier eyes, and the blood running from her lips. He
presently ran to her, and with a voice full at once of tenderness and
terrour, cried, "O my Sophia, what means this dreadful sight?" She
looked softly at him for a moment before she spoke, and then said, "Mr
Jones, for Heaven's sake how came you here?--Leave me, I beseech you,
this moment."--"Do not," says he, "impose so harsh a command upon
me--my heart bleeds faster than those lips. O Sophia, how easily could
I drain my veins to preserve one drop of that dear blood."--"I have
too many obligations to you already," answered she, "for sure you
meant them such." Here she looked at him tenderly almost a minute, and
then bursting into an agony, cried, "Oh, Mr Jones, why did you save my
life? my death would have been happier for us both."--"Happier for us
both!" cried he. "Could racks or wheels kill me so painfully as
Sophia's--I cannot bear the dreadful sound. Do I live but for her?"
Both his voice and looks were full of inexpressible tenderness when he
spoke these words; and at the same time he laid gently hold on her
hand, which she did not withdraw from him; to say the truth, she
hardly knew what she did or suffered. A few moments now passed in
silence between these lovers, while his eyes were eagerly fixed on
Sophia, and hers declining towards the ground: at last she recovered
strength enough to desire him again to leave her, for that her certain
ruin would be the consequence of their being found together; adding,
"Oh, Mr Jones, you know not, you know not what hath passed this cruel
afternoon."--"I know all, my Sophia," answered he; "your cruel father
hath told me all, and he himself hath sent me hither to you."--"My
father sent you to me!" replied she: "sure you dream."--"Would to
Heaven," cries he, "it was but a dream! Oh, Sophia, your father hath
sent me to you, to be an advocate for my odious rival, to solicit you
in his favour. I took any means to get access to you. O speak to me,
Sophia! comfort my bleeding heart. Sure no one ever loved, ever doated
like me. Do not unkindly withhold this dear, this soft, this gentle
hand--one moment, perhaps, tears you for ever from me--nothing less
than this cruel occasion could, I believe, have ever conquered the
respect and awe with which you have inspired me." She stood a moment
silent, and covered with confusion; then lifting up her eyes gently
towards him, she cried, "What would Mr Jones have me say?"--"O do but
promise," cries he, "that you never will give yourself to
Blifil."--"Name not," answered she, "the detested sound. Be assured I
never will give him what is in my power to withhold from him."--"Now
then," cries he, "while you are so perfectly kind, go a little
farther, and add that I may hope."--"Alas!" says she, "Mr Jones,
whither will you drive me? What hope have I to bestow? You know my
father's intentions."--"But I know," answered he, "your compliance
with them cannot be compelled."--"What," says she, "must be the
dreadful consequence of my disobedience? My own ruin is my least
concern. I cannot bear the thoughts of being the cause of my father's
misery."--"He is himself the cause," cries Jones, "by exacting a power
over you which Nature hath not given him. Think on the misery which I
am to suffer if I am to lose you, and see on which side pity will turn
the balance."--"Think of it!" replied she: "can you imagine I do not
feel the ruin which I must bring on you, should I comply with your
desire? It is that thought which gives me resolution to bid you fly
from me for ever, and avoid your own destruction."--"I fear no
destruction," cries he, "but the loss of Sophia. If you would save me
from the most bitter agonies, recall that cruel sentence. Indeed, I
can never part with you, indeed I cannot."

The lovers now stood both silent and trembling, Sophia being unable to
withdraw her hand from Jones, and he almost as unable to hold it; when
the scene, which I believe some of my readers will think had lasted
long enough, was interrupted by one of so different a nature, that we
shall reserve the relation of it for a different chapter.



Chapter ix.

Being of a much more tempestuous kind than the former.


Before we proceed with what now happened to our lovers, it may be
proper to recount what had past in the hall during their tender
interview.

Soon after Jones had left Mr Western in the manner above mentioned,
his sister came to him, and was presently informed of all that had
passed between her brother and Sophia relating to Blifil.

This behaviour in her niece the good lady construed to be an absolute
breach of the condition on which she had engaged to keep her love for
Mr Jones a secret. She considered herself, therefore, at full liberty
to reveal all she knew to the squire, which she immediately did in the
most explicit terms, and without any ceremony or preface.

The idea of a marriage between Jones and his daughter, had never once
entered into the squire's head, either in the warmest minutes of his
affection towards that young man, or from suspicion, or on any other
occasion. He did indeed consider a parity of fortune and circumstances
to be physically as necessary an ingredient in marriage, as difference
of sexes, or any other essential; and had no more apprehension of his
daughter's falling in love with a poor man, than with any animal of a
different species.

He became, therefore, like one thunderstruck at his sister's relation.
He was, at first, incapable of making any answer, having been almost
deprived of his breath by the violence of the surprize. This, however,
soon returned, and, as is usual in other cases after an intermission,
with redoubled force and fury.

The first use he made of the power of speech, after his recovery from
the sudden effects of his astonishment, was to discharge a round
volley of oaths and imprecations. After which he proceeded hastily to
the apartment where he expected to find the lovers, and murmured, or
rather indeed roared forth, intentions of revenge every step he went.

As when two doves, or two wood-pigeons, or as when Strephon and
Phyllis (for that comes nearest to the mark) are retired into some
pleasant solitary grove, to enjoy the delightful conversation of Love,
that bashful boy, who cannot speak in public, and is never a good
companion to more than two at a time; here, while every object is
serene, should hoarse thunder burst suddenly through the shattered
clouds, and rumbling roll along the sky, the frightened maid starts
from the mossy bank or verdant turf, the pale livery of death succeeds
the red regimentals in which Love had before drest her cheeks, fear
shakes her whole frame, and her lover scarce supports her trembling
tottering limbs.

Or as when two gentlemen, strangers to the wondrous wit of the place,
are cracking a bottle together at some inn or tavern at Salisbury, if
the great Dowdy, who acts the part of a madman as well as some of his
setters-on do that of a fool, should rattle his chains, and dreadfully
hum forth the grumbling catch along the gallery; the frighted
strangers stand aghast; scared at the horrid sound, they seek some
place of shelter from the approaching danger; and if the well-barred
windows did admit their exit, would venture their necks to escape the
threatening fury now coming upon them.

So trembled poor Sophia, so turned she pale at the noise of her
father, who, in a voice most dreadful to hear, came on swearing,
cursing, and vowing the destruction of Jones. To say the truth, I
believe the youth himself would, from some prudent considerations,
have preferred another place of abode at this time, had his terror on
Sophia's account given him liberty to reflect a moment on what any
otherways concerned himself, than as his love made him partake
whatever affected her.

And now the squire, having burst open the door, beheld an object which
instantly suspended all his fury against Jones; this was the ghastly
appearance of Sophia, who had fainted away in her lover's arms. This
tragical sight Mr Western no sooner beheld, than all his rage forsook
him; he roared for help with his utmost violence; ran first to his
daughter, then back to the door calling for water, and then back again
to Sophia, never considering in whose arms she then was, nor perhaps
once recollecting that there was such a person in the world as Jones;
for indeed I believe the present circumstances of his daughter were
now the sole consideration which employed his thoughts.

Mrs Western and a great number of servants soon came to the assistance
of Sophia with water, cordials, and everything necessary on those
occasions. These were applied with such success, that Sophia in a very
few minutes began to recover, and all the symptoms of life to return.
Upon which she was presently led off by her own maid and Mrs Western:
nor did that good lady depart without leaving some wholesome
admonitions with her brother, on the dreadful effects of his passion,
or, as she pleased to call it, madness.

The squire, perhaps, did not understand this good advice, as it was
delivered in obscure hints, shrugs, and notes of admiration: at least,
if he did understand it, he profited very little by it; for no sooner
was he cured of his immediate fears for his daughter, than he relapsed
into his former frenzy, which must have produced an immediate battle
with Jones, had not parson Supple, who was a very strong man, been
present, and by mere force restrained the squire from acts of
hostility.

The moment Sophia was departed, Jones advanced in a very suppliant
manner to Mr Western, whom the parson held in his arms, and begged him
to be pacified; for that, while he continued in such a passion, it
would be impossible to give him any satisfaction.

"I wull have satisfaction o' thee," answered the squire; "so doff thy
clothes. _At unt_ half a man, and I'll lick thee as well as wast ever
licked in thy life." He then bespattered the youth with abundance of
that language which passes between country gentlemen who embrace
opposite sides of the question; with frequent applications to him to
salute that part which is generally introduced into all controversies
that arise among the lower orders of the English gentry at
horse-races, cock-matches, and other public places. Allusions to this
part are likewise often made for the sake of the jest. And here, I
believe, the wit is generally misunderstood. In reality, it lies in
desiring another to kiss your a-- for having just before threatened to
kick his; for I have observed very accurately, that no one ever
desires you to kick that which belongs to himself, nor offers to kiss
this part in another.

It may likewise seem surprizing that in the many thousand kind
invitations of this sort, which every one who hath conversed with
country gentlemen must have heard, no one, I believe, hath ever seen a
single instance where the desire hath been complied with;--a great
instance of their want of politeness; for in town nothing can be more
common than for the finest gentlemen to perform this ceremony every
day to their superiors, without having that favour once requested of
them.

To all such wit, Jones very calmly answered, "Sir, this usage may
perhaps cancel every other obligation you have conferred on me; but
there is one you can never cancel; nor will I be provoked by your
abuse to lift my hand against the father of Sophia."

At these words the squire grew still more outrageous than before; so
that the parson begged Jones to retire; saying, "You behold, sir, how
he waxeth wrath at your abode here; therefore let me pray you not to
tarry any longer. His anger is too much kindled for you to commune
with him at present. You had better, therefore, conclude your visit,
and refer what matters you have to urge in your behalf to some other
opportunity."

Jones accepted this advice with thanks, and immediately departed. The
squire now regained the liberty of his hands, and so much temper as to
express some satisfaction in the restraint which had been laid upon
him; declaring that he should certainly have beat his brains out; and
adding, "It would have vexed one confoundedly to have been hanged for
such a rascal."

The parson now began to triumph in the success of his peace-making
endeavours, and proceeded to read a lecture against anger, which might
perhaps rather have tended to raise than to quiet that passion in some
hasty minds. This lecture he enriched with many valuable quotations
from the antients, particularly from Seneca; who hath indeed so well
handled this passion, that none but a very angry man can read him
without great pleasure and profit. The doctor concluded this harangue
with the famous story of Alexander and Clitus; but as I find that
entered in my common-place under title Drunkenness, I shall not insert
it here.

The squire took no notice of this story, nor perhaps of anything he
said; for he interrupted him before he had finished, by calling for a
tankard of beer; observing (which is perhaps as true as any
observation on this fever of the mind) that anger makes a man dry.

No sooner had the squire swallowed a large draught than he renewed the
discourse on Jones, and declared a resolution of going the next
morning early to acquaint Mr Allworthy. His friend would have
dissuaded him from this, from the mere motive of good-nature; but his
dissuasion had no other effect than to produce a large volley of oaths
and curses, which greatly shocked the pious ears of Supple; but he did
not dare to remonstrate against a privilege which the squire claimed
as a freeborn Englishman. To say truth, the parson submitted to please
his palate at the squire's table, at the expense of suffering now and
then this violence to his ears. He contented himself with thinking he
did not promote this evil practice, and that the squire would not
swear an oath the less, if he never entered within his gates. However,
though he was not guilty of ill manners by rebuking a gentleman in his
own house, he paid him off obliquely in the pulpit: which had not,
indeed, the good effect of working a reformation in the squire
himself; yet it so far operated on his conscience, that he put the
laws very severely in execution against others, and the magistrate was
the only person in the parish who could swear with impunity.



Chapter x.

In which Mr Western visits Mr Allworthy.


Mr Allworthy was now retired from breakfast with his nephew, well
satisfied with the report of the young gentleman's successful visit to
Sophia (for he greatly desired the match, more on account of the young
lady's character than of her riches), when Mr Western broke abruptly
in upon them, and without any ceremony began as follows:--

"There, you have done a fine piece of work truly! You have brought up
your bastard to a fine purpose; not that I believe you have had any
hand in it neither, that is, as a man may say, designedly: but there
is a fine kettle-of-fish made on't up at our house." "What can be the
matter, Mr Western?" said Allworthy. "O, matter enow of all
conscience: my daughter hath fallen in love with your bastard, that's
all; but I won't ge her a hapeny, not the twentieth part of a brass
varden. I always thought what would come o' breeding up a bastard like
a gentleman, and letting un come about to vok's houses. It's well vor
un I could not get at un: I'd a lick'd un; I'd a spoil'd his
caterwauling; I'd a taught the son of a whore to meddle with meat for
his master. He shan't ever have a morsel of meat of mine, or a varden
to buy it: if she will ha un, one smock shall be her portion. I'd
sooner ge my esteate to the zinking fund, that it may be sent to
Hanover to corrupt our nation with." "I am heartily sorry," cries
Allworthy. "Pox o' your sorrow," says Western; "it will do me
abundance of good when I have lost my only child, my poor Sophy, that
was the joy of my heart, and all the hope and comfort of my age; but I
am resolved I will turn her out o' doors; she shall beg, and starve,
and rot in the streets. Not one hapeny, not a hapeny shall she ever
hae o' mine. The son of a bitch was always good at finding a hare
sitting, an be rotted to'n: I little thought what puss he was looking
after; but it shall be the worst he ever vound in his life. She shall
be no better than carrion: the skin o'er is all he shall ha, and zu
you may tell un." "I am in amazement," cries Allworthy, "at what you
tell me, after what passed between my nephew and the young lady no
longer ago than yesterday." "Yes, sir," answered Western, "it was
after what passed between your nephew and she that the whole matter
came out. Mr Blifil there was no sooner gone than the son of a whore
came lurching about the house. Little did I think when I used to love
him for a sportsman that he was all the while a poaching after my
daughter." "Why truly," says Allworthy, "I could wish you had not
given him so many opportunities with her; and you will do me the
justice to acknowledge that I have always been averse to his staying
so much at your house, though I own I had no suspicion of this kind."
"Why, zounds," cries Western, "who could have thought it? What the
devil had she to do wi'n? He did not come there a courting to her; he
came there a hunting with me." "But was it possible," says Allworthy,
"that you should never discern any symptoms of love between them, when
you have seen them so often together?" "Never in my life, as I hope to
be saved," cries Western: "I never so much as zeed him kiss her in all
my life; and so far from courting her, he used rather to be more
silent when she was in company than at any other time; and as for the
girl, she was always less civil to'n than to any young man that came
to the house. As to that matter, I am not more easy to be deceived
than another; I would not have you think I am, neighbour." Allworthy
could scarce refrain laughter at this; but he resolved to do a
violence to himself; for he perfectly well knew mankind, and had too
much good-breeding and good-nature to offend the squire in his present
circumstances. He then asked Western what he would have him do upon
this occasion. To which the other answered, "That he would have him
keep the rascal away from his house, and that he would go and lock up
the wench; for he was resolved to make her marry Mr Blifil in spite of
her teeth." He then shook Blifil by the hand, and swore he would have
no other son-in-law. Presently after which he took his leave; saying
his house was in such disorder that it was necessary for him to make
haste home, to take care his daughter did not give him the slip; and
as for Jones, he swore if he caught him at his house, he would qualify
him to run for the geldings' plate.

When Allworthy and Blifil were again left together, a long silence
ensued between them; all which interval the young gentleman filled up
with sighs, which proceeded partly from disappointment, but more from
hatred; for the success of Jones was much more grievous to him than
the loss of Sophia.

At length his uncle asked him what he was determined to do, and he
answered in the following words:--"Alas! sir, can it be a question
what step a lover will take, when reason and passion point different
ways? I am afraid it is too certain he will, in that dilemma, always
follow the latter. Reason dictates to me, to quit all thoughts of a
woman who places her affections on another; my passion bids me hope
she may in time change her inclinations in my favour. Here, however, I
conceive an objection may be raised, which, if it could not fully be
answered, would totally deter me from any further pursuit. I mean the
injustice of endeavouring to supplant another in a heart of which he
seems already in possession; but the determined resolution of Mr
Western shows that, in this case, I shall, by so doing, promote the
happiness of every party; not only that of the parent, who will thus
be preserved from the highest degree of misery, but of both the
others, who must be undone by this match. The lady, I am sure, will be
undone in every sense; for, besides the loss of most part of her own
fortune, she will be not only married to a beggar, but the little
fortune which her father cannot withhold from her will be squandered
on that wench with whom I know he yet converses. Nay, that is a
trifle; for I know him to be one of the worst men in the world; for
had my dear uncle known what I have hitherto endeavoured to conceal,
he must have long since abandoned so profligate a wretch." "How!" said
Allworthy; "hath he done anything worse than I already know? Tell me,
I beseech you?" "No," replied Blifil; "it is now past, and perhaps he
may have repented of it." "I command you, on your duty," said
Allworthy, "to tell me what you mean." "You know, sir," says Blifil,
"I never disobeyed you; but I am sorry I mentioned it, since it may
now look like revenge, whereas, I thank Heaven, no such motive ever
entered my heart; and if you oblige me to discover it, I must be his
petitioner to you for your forgiveness." "I will have no conditions,"
answered Allworthy; "I think I have shown tenderness enough towards
him, and more perhaps than you ought to thank me for." "More, indeed,
I fear, than he deserved," cries Blifil; "for in the very day of your
utmost danger, when myself and all the family were in tears, he filled
the house with riot and debauchery. He drank, and sung, and roared;
and when I gave him a gentle hint of the indecency of his actions, he
fell into a violent passion, swore many oaths, called me rascal, and
struck me." "How!" cries Allworthy; "did he dare to strike you?" "I am
sure," cries Blifil, "I have forgiven him that long ago. I wish I
could so easily forget his ingratitude to the best of benefactors; and
yet even that I hope you will forgive him, since he must have
certainly been possessed with the devil: for that very evening, as Mr
Thwackum and myself were taking the air in the fields, and exulting in
the good symptoms which then first began to discover themselves, we
unluckily saw him engaged with a wench in a manner not fit to be
mentioned. Mr Thwackum, with more boldness than prudence, advanced to
rebuke him, when (I am sorry to say it) he fell upon the worthy man,
and beat him so outrageously that I wish he may have yet recovered the
bruises. Nor was I without my share of the effects of his malice,
while I endeavoured to protect my tutor; but that I have long
forgiven; nay, I prevailed with Mr Thwackum to forgive him too, and
not to inform you of a secret which I feared might be fatal to him.
And now, sir, since I have unadvisedly dropped a hint of this matter,
and your commands have obliged me to discover the whole, let me
intercede with you for him." "O child!" said Allworthy, "I know not
whether I should blame or applaud your goodness, in concealing such
villany a moment: but where is Mr Thwackum? Not that I want any
confirmation of what you say; but I will examine all the evidence of
this matter, to justify to the world the example I am resolved to make
of such a monster."

Thwackum was now sent for, and presently appeared. He corroborated
every circumstance which the other had deposed; nay, he produced the
record upon his breast, where the handwriting of Mr Jones remained
very legible in black and blue. He concluded with declaring to Mr
Allworthy, that he should have long since informed him of this matter,
had not Mr Blifil, by the most earnest interpositions, prevented him.
"He is," says he, "an excellent youth: though such forgiveness of
enemies is carrying the matter too far."

In reality, Blifil had taken some pains to prevail with the parson,
and to prevent the discovery at that time; for which he had many
reasons. He knew that the minds of men are apt to be softened and
relaxed from their usual severity by sickness. Besides, he imagined
that if the story was told when the fact was so recent, and the
physician about the house, who might have unravelled the real truth,
he should never be able to give it the malicious turn which he
intended. Again, he resolved to hoard up this business, till the
indiscretion of Jones should afford some additional complaints; for he
thought the joint weight of many facts falling upon him together,
would be the most likely to crush him; and he watched, therefore, some
such opportunity as that with which fortune had now kindly presented
him. Lastly, by prevailing with Thwackum to conceal the matter for a
time, he knew he should confirm an opinion of his friendship to Jones,
which he had greatly laboured to establish in Mr Allworthy.



Chapter xi.

A short chapter; but which contains sufficient matter to affect the
good-natured reader.


It was Mr Allworthy's custom never to punish any one, not even to turn
away a servant, in a passion. He resolved therefore to delay passing
sentence on Jones till the afternoon.

The poor young man attended at dinner, as usual; but his heart was too
much loaded to suffer him to eat. His grief too was a good deal
aggravated by the unkind looks of Mr Allworthy; whence he concluded
that Western had discovered the whole affair between him and Sophia;
but as to Mr Blifil's story, he had not the least apprehension; for of
much the greater part he was entirely innocent; and for the residue,
as he had forgiven and forgotten it himself, so he suspected no
remembrance on the other side. When dinner was over, and the servants
departed, Mr Allworthy began to harangue. He set forth, in a long
speech, the many iniquities of which Jones had been guilty,
particularly those which this day had brought to light; and concluded
by telling him, "That unless he could clear himself of the charge, he
was resolved to banish him his sight for ever."

Many disadvantages attended poor Jones in making his defence; nay,
indeed, he hardly knew his accusation; for as Mr Allworthy, in
recounting the drunkenness, &c., while he lay ill, out of modesty sunk
everything that related particularly to himself, which indeed
principally constituted the crime; Jones could not deny the charge.
His heart was, besides, almost broken already; and his spirits were so
sunk, that he could say nothing for himself; but acknowledged the
whole, and, like a criminal in despair, threw himself upon mercy;
concluding, "That though he must own himself guilty of many follies
and inadvertencies, he hoped he had done nothing to deserve what would
be to him the greatest punishment in the world."

Allworthy answered, "That he had forgiven him too often already, in
compassion to his youth, and in hopes of his amendment: that he now
found he was an abandoned reprobate, and such as it would be criminal
in any one to support and encourage. Nay," said Mr Allworthy to him,
"your audacious attempt to steal away the young lady, calls upon me to
justify my own character in punishing you. The world who have already
censured the regard I have shown for you may think, with some colour
at least of justice, that I connive at so base and barbarous an
action--an action of which you must have known my abhorrence: and
which, had you had any concern for my ease and honour, as well as for
my friendship, you would never have thought of undertaking. Fie upon
it, young man! indeed there is scarce any punishment equal to your
crimes, and I can scarce think myself justifiable in what I am now
going to bestow on you. However, as I have educated you like a child
of my own, I will not turn you naked into the world. When you open
this paper, therefore, you will find something which may enable you,
with industry, to get an honest livelihood; but if you employ it to
worse purposes, I shall not think myself obliged to supply you
farther, being resolved, from this day forward, to converse no more
with you on any account. I cannot avoid saying, there is no part of
your conduct which I resent more than your ill-treatment of that good
young man (meaning Blifil) who hath behaved with so much tenderness
and honour towards you."

These last words were a dose almost too bitter to be swallowed. A
flood of tears now gushed from the eyes of Jones, and every faculty of
speech and motion seemed to have deserted him. It was some time before
he was able to obey Allworthy's peremptory commands of departing;
which he at length did, having first kissed his hands with a passion
difficult to be affected, and as difficult to be described.

The reader must be very weak, if, when he considers the light in which
Jones then appeared to Mr Allworthy, he should blame the rigour of his
sentence. And yet all the neighbourhood, either from this weakness, or
from some worse motive, condemned this justice and severity as the
highest cruelty. Nay, the very persons who had before censured the
good man for the kindness and tenderness shown to a bastard (his own,
according to the general opinion), now cried out as loudly against
turning his own child out of doors. The women especially were
unanimous in taking the part of Jones, and raised more stories on the
occasion than I have room, in this chapter, to set down.

One thing must not be omitted, that, in their censures on this
occasion, none ever mentioned the sum contained in the paper which
Allworthy gave Jones, which was no less than five hundred pounds; but
all agreed that he was sent away penniless, and some said naked, from
the house of his inhuman father.



Chapter xii.

Containing love-letters, &c.


Jones was commanded to leave the house immediately, and told, that his
clothes and everything else should be sent to him whithersoever he
should order them.

He accordingly set out, and walked above a mile, not regarding, and
indeed scarce knowing, whither he went. At length a little brook
obstructing his passage, he threw himself down by the side of it; nor
could he help muttering with some little indignation, "Sure my father
will not deny me this place to rest in!"

Here he presently fell into the most violent agonies, tearing his hair
from his head, and using most other actions which generally accompany
fits of madness, rage, and despair.

When he had in this manner vented the first emotions of passion, he
began to come a little to himself. His grief now took another turn,
and discharged itself in a gentler way, till he became at last cool
enough to reason with his passion, and to consider what steps were
proper to be taken in his deplorable condition.

And now the great doubt was, how to act with regard to Sophia. The
thoughts of leaving her almost rent his heart asunder; but the
consideration of reducing her to ruin and beggary still racked him, if
possible, more; and if the violent desire of possessing her person
could have induced him to listen one moment to this alternative, still
he was by no means certain of her resolution to indulge his wishes at
so high an expense. The resentment of Mr Allworthy, and the injury he
must do to his quiet, argued strongly against this latter; and lastly,
the apparent impossibility of his success, even if he would sacrifice
all these considerations to it, came to his assistance; and thus
honour at last backed with despair, with gratitude to his benefactor,
and with real love to his mistress, got the better of burning desire,
and he resolved rather to quit Sophia, than pursue her to her ruin.

It is difficult for any who have not felt it, to conceive the glowing
warmth which filled his breast on the first contemplation of this
victory over his passion. Pride flattered him so agreeably, that his
mind perhaps enjoyed perfect happiness; but this was only momentary:
Sophia soon returned to his imagination, and allayed the joy of his
triumph with no less bitter pangs than a good-natured general must
feel, when he surveys the bleeding heaps, at the price of whose blood
he hath purchased his laurels; for thousands of tender ideas lay
murdered before our conqueror.

Being resolved, however, to pursue the paths of this giant honour, as
the gigantic poet Lee calls it, he determined to write a farewel
letter to Sophia; and accordingly proceeded to a house not far off,
where, being furnished with proper materials, he wrote as follows:--

  "MADAM,

  "When you reflect on the situation in which I write, I am sure your
  good-nature will pardon any inconsistency or absurdity which my
  letter contains; for everything here flows from a heart so full,
  that no language can express its dictates.

  "I have resolved, madam, to obey your commands, in flying for ever
  from your dear, your lovely sight. Cruel indeed those commands are;
  but it is a cruelty which proceeds from fortune, not from my Sophia.
  Fortune hath made it necessary, necessary to your preservation, to
  forget there ever was such a wretch as I am.

  "Believe me, I would not hint all my sufferings to you, if I
  imagined they could possibly escape your ears. I know the goodness
  and tenderness of your heart, and would avoid giving you any of
  those pains which you always feel for the miserable. O let nothing,
  which you shall hear of my hard fortune, cause a moment's concern;
  for, after the loss of you, everything is to me a trifle.

  "O Sophia! it is hard to leave you; it is harder still to desire you
  to forget me; yet the sincerest love obliges me to both. Pardon my
  conceiving that any remembrance of me can give you disquiet; but if
  I am so gloriously wretched, sacrifice me every way to your relief.
  Think I never loved you; or think truly how little I deserve you;
  and learn to scorn me for a presumption which can never be too
  severely punished.--I am unable to say more.--May guardian angels
  protect you for ever!"

He was now searching his pockets for his wax, but found none, nor
indeed anything else, therein; for in truth he had, in his frantic
disposition, tossed everything from him, and amongst the rest, his
pocket-book, which he had received from Mr Allworthy, which he had
never opened, and which now first occurred to his memory.

The house supplied him with a wafer for his present purpose, with
which, having sealed his letter, he returned hastily towards the brook
side, in order to search for the things which he had there lost. In
his way he met his old friend Black George, who heartily condoled with
him on his misfortune; for this had already reached his ears, and
indeed those of all the neighbourhood.

Jones acquainted the gamekeeper with his loss, and he as readily went
back with him to the brook, where they searched every tuft of grass in
the meadow, as well where Jones had not been as where he had been; but
all to no purpose, for they found nothing; for, indeed, though the
things were then in the meadow, they omitted to search the only place
where they were deposited; to wit, in the pockets of the said George;
for he had just before found them, and being luckily apprized of their
value, had very carefully put them up for his own use.

The gamekeeper having exerted as much diligence in quest of the lost
goods, as if he had hoped to find them, desired Mr Jones to recollect
if he had been in no other place: "For sure," said he, "if you had
lost them here so lately, the things must have been here still; for
this is a very unlikely place for any one to pass by." And indeed it
was by great accident that he himself had passed through that field,
in order to lay wires for hares, with which he was to supply a
poulterer at Bath the next morning.

Jones now gave over all hopes of recovering his loss, and almost all
thoughts concerning it, and turning to Black George, asked him
earnestly if he would do him the greatest favour in the world?

George answered with some hesitation, "Sir, you know you may command
me whatever is in my power, and I heartily wish it was in my power to
do you any service." In fact, the question staggered him; for he had,
by selling game, amassed a pretty good sum of money in Mr Western's
service, and was afraid that Jones wanted to borrow some small matter
of him; but he was presently relieved from his anxiety, by being
desired to convey a letter to Sophia, which with great pleasure he
promised to do. And indeed I believe there are few favours which he
would not have gladly conferred on Mr Jones; for he bore as much
gratitude towards him as he could, and was as honest as men who love
money better than any other thing in the universe, generally are.

Mrs Honour was agreed by both to be the proper means by which this
letter should pass to Sophia. They then separated; the gamekeeper
returned home to Mr Western's, and Jones walked to an alehouse at half
a mile's distance, to wait for his messenger's return.

George no sooner came home to his master's house than he met with Mrs
Honour; to whom, having first sounded her with a few previous
questions, he delivered the letter for her mistress, and received at
the same time another from her, for Mr Jones; which Honour told him
she had carried all that day in her bosom, and began to despair of
finding any means of delivering it.

The gamekeeper returned hastily and joyfully to Jones, who, having
received Sophia's letter from him, instantly withdrew, and eagerly
breaking it open, read as follows:--

  "SIR,

  "It is impossible to express what I have felt since I saw you. Your
  submitting, on my account, to such cruel insults from my father,
  lays me under an obligation I shall ever own. As you know his
  temper, I beg you will, for my sake, avoid him. I wish I had any
  comfort to send you; but believe this, that nothing but the last
  violence shall ever give my hand or heart where you would be sorry
  to see them bestowed."

Jones read this letter a hundred times over, and kissed it a hundred
times as often. His passion now brought all tender desires back into
his mind. He repented that he had writ to Sophia in the manner we have
seen above; but he repented more that he had made use of the interval
of his messenger's absence to write and dispatch a letter to Mr
Allworthy, in which he had faithfully promised and bound himself to
quit all thoughts of his love. However, when his cool reflections
returned, he plainly perceived that his case was neither mended nor
altered by Sophia's billet, unless to give him some little glimpse of
hope, from her constancy, of some favourable accident hereafter. He
therefore resumed his resolution, and taking leave of Black George,
set forward to a town about five miles distant, whither he had desired
Mr Allworthy, unless he pleased to revoke his sentence, to send his
things after him.



Chapter xiii.

The behaviour of Sophia on the present occasion; which none of her sex
will blame, who are capable of behaving in the same manner. And the
discussion of a knotty point in the court of conscience.


Sophia had passed the last twenty-four hours in no very desirable
manner. During a large part of them she had been entertained by her
aunt with lectures of prudence, recommending to her the example of the
polite world, where love (so the good lady said) is at present
entirely laughed at, and where women consider matrimony, as men do
offices of public trust, only as the means of making their fortunes,
and of advancing themselves in the world. In commenting on which text
Mrs Western had displayed her eloquence during several hours.

These sagacious lectures, though little suited either to the taste or
inclination of Sophia, were, however, less irksome to her than her own
thoughts, that formed the entertainment of the night, during which she
never once closed her eyes.

But though she could neither sleep nor rest in her bed, yet, having no
avocation from it, she was found there by her father at his return
from Allworthy's, which was not till past ten o'clock in the morning.
He went directly up to her apartment, opened the door, and seeing she
was not up, cried, "Oh! you are safe then, and I am resolved to keep
you so." He then locked the door, and delivered the key to Honour,
having first given her the strictest charge, with great promises of
rewards for her fidelity, and most dreadful menaces of punishment in
case she should betray her trust.

Honour's orders were, not to suffer her mistress to come out of her
room without the authority of the squire himself, and to admit none to
her but him and her aunt; but she was herself to attend her with
whatever Sophia pleased, except only pen, ink, and paper, of which she
was forbidden the use.

The squire ordered his daughter to dress herself and attend him at
dinner; which she obeyed; and having sat the usual time, was again
conducted to her prison.

In the evening the gaoler Honour brought her the letter which she
received from the gamekeeper. Sophia read it very attentively twice or
thrice over, and then threw herself upon the bed, and burst into a
flood of tears. Mrs Honour expressed great astonishment at this
behaviour in her mistress; nor could she forbear very eagerly begging
to know the cause of this passion. Sophia made her no answer for some
time, and then, starting suddenly up, caught her maid by the hand, and
cried, "O Honour! I am undone." "Marry forbid," cries Honour: "I wish
the letter had been burnt before I had brought it to your la'ship. I'm
sure I thought it would have comforted your la'ship, or I would have
seen it at the devil before I would have touched it." "Honour," says
Sophia, "you are a good girl, and it is vain to attempt concealing
longer my weakness from you; I have thrown away my heart on a man who
hath forsaken me." "And is Mr Jones," answered the maid, "such a
perfidy man?" "He hath taken his leave of me," says Sophia, "for ever
in that letter. Nay, he hath desired me to forget him. Could he have
desired that if he had loved me? Could he have borne such a thought?
Could he have written such a word?" "No, certainly, ma'am," cries
Honour; "and to be sure, if the best man in England was to desire me
to forget him, I'd take him at his word. Marry, come up! I am sure
your la'ship hath done him too much honour ever to think on him;--a
young lady who may take her choice of all the young men in the
country. And to be sure, if I may be so presumptuous as to offer my
poor opinion, there is young Mr Blifil, who, besides that he is come
of honest parents, and will be one of the greatest squires all
hereabouts, he is to be sure, in my poor opinion, a more handsomer and
a more politer man by half; and besides, he is a young gentleman of a
sober character, and who may defy any of the neighbours to say black
is his eye; he follows no dirty trollops, nor can any bastards be laid
at his door. Forget him, indeed! I thank Heaven I myself am not so
much at my last prayers as to suffer any man to bid me forget him
twice. If the best he that wears a head was for to go for to offer to
say such an affronting word to me, I would never give him my company
afterwards, if there was another young man in the kingdom. And as I
was a saying, to be sure, there is young Mr Blifil." "Name not his
detested name," cries Sophia. "Nay, ma'am," says Honour, "if your
la'ship doth not like him, there be more jolly handsome young men that
would court your la'ship, if they had but the least encouragement. I
don't believe there is arrow young gentleman in this county, or in the
next to it, that if your la'ship was but to look as if you had a mind
to him, would not come about to make his offers directly." "What a
wretch dost thou imagine me," cries Sophia, "by affronting my ears
with such stuff! I detest all mankind." "Nay, to be sure, ma'am,"
answered Honour, "your la'ship hath had enough to give you a surfeit
of them. To be used ill by such a poor, beggarly, bastardly
fellow."--"Hold your blasphemous tongue," cries Sophia: "how dare you
mention his name with disrespect before me? He use me ill? No, his
poor bleeding heart suffered more when he writ the cruel words than
mine from reading them. O! he is all heroic virtue and angelic
goodness. I am ashamed of the weakness of my own passion, for blaming
what I ought to admire. O, Honour! it is my good only which he
consults. To my interest he sacrifices both himself and me. The
apprehension of ruining me hath driven him to despair." "I am very
glad," says Honour, "to hear your la'ship takes that into your
consideration; for to be sure, it must be nothing less than ruin to
give your mind to one that is turned out of doors, and is not worth a
farthing in the world." "Turned out of doors!" cries Sophia hastily:
"how! what dost thou mean?" "Why, to be sure, ma'am, my master no
sooner told Squire Allworthy about Mr Jones having offered to make
love to your la'ship than the squire stripped him stark naked, and
turned him out of doors!" "Ha!" says Sophia, "I have been the cursed,
wretched cause of his destruction! Turned naked out of doors! Here,
Honour, take all the money I have; take the rings from my fingers.
Here, my watch: carry him all. Go find him immediately." "For Heaven's
sake, ma'am," answered Mrs Honour, "do but consider, if my master
should miss any of these things, I should be made to answer for them.
Therefore let me beg your la'ship not to part with your watch and
jewels. Besides, the money, I think, is enough of all conscience; and
as for that, my master can never know anything of the matter." "Here,
then," cries Sophia, "take every farthing I am worth, find him out
immediately, and give it him. Go, go, lose not a moment."

Mrs Honour departed according to orders, and finding Black George
below-stairs, delivered him the purse, which contained sixteen
guineas, being, indeed, the whole stock of Sophia; for though her
father was very liberal to her, she was much too generous to be rich.

Black George having received the purse, set forward towards the
alehouse; but in the way a thought occurred to him, whether he should
not detain this money likewise. His conscience, however, immediately
started at this suggestion, and began to upbraid him with ingratitude
to his benefactor. To this his avarice answered, That his conscience
should have considered the matter before, when he deprived poor Jones
of his £500. That having quietly acquiesced in what was of so much
greater importance, it was absurd, if not downright hypocrisy, to
affect any qualms at this trifle. In return to which, Conscience, like
a good lawyer, attempted to distinguish between an absolute breach of
trust, as here, where the goods were delivered, and a bare concealment
of what was found, as in the former case. Avarice presently treated
this with ridicule, called it a distinction without a difference, and
absolutely insisted that when once all pretensions of honour and
virtue were given up in any one instance, that there was no precedent
for resorting to them upon a second occasion. In short, poor
Conscience had certainly been defeated in the argument, had not Fear
stept in to her assistance, and very strenuously urged that the real
distinction between the two actions, did not lie in the different
degrees of honour but of safety: for that the secreting the £500 was a
matter of very little hazard; whereas the detaining the sixteen
guineas was liable to the utmost danger of discovery.

By this friendly aid of Fear, Conscience obtained a compleat victory
in the mind of Black George, and, after making him a few compliments
on his honesty, forced him to deliver the money to Jones.



Chapter xiv.

A short chapter, containing a short dialogue between Squire Western
and his sister.


Mrs Western had been engaged abroad all that day. The squire met her
at her return home; and when she enquired after Sophia, he acquainted
her that he had secured her safe enough. "She is locked up in
chamber," cries he, "and Honour keeps the key." As his looks were full
of prodigious wisdom and sagacity when he gave his sister this
information, it is probable he expected much applause from her for
what he had done; but how was he disappointed when, with a most
disdainful aspect, she cried, "Sure, brother, you are the weakest of
all men. Why will you not confide in me for the management of my
niece? Why will you interpose? You have now undone all that I have
been spending my breath in order to bring about. While I have been
endeavouring to fill her mind with maxims of prudence, you have been
provoking her to reject them. English women, brother, I thank heaven,
are no slaves. We are not to be locked up like the Spanish and Italian
wives. We have as good a right to liberty as yourselves. We are to be
convinced by reason and persuasion only, and not governed by force. I
have seen the world, brother, and know what arguments to make use of;
and if your folly had not prevented me, should have prevailed with her
to form her conduct by those rules of prudence and discretion which I
formerly taught her." "To be sure," said the squire, "I am always in
the wrong." "Brother," answered the lady, "you are not in the wrong,
unless when you meddle with matters beyond your knowledge. You must
agree that I have seen most of the world; and happy had it been for my
niece if she had not been taken from under my care. It is by living at
home with you that she hath learnt romantic notions of love and
nonsense." "You don't imagine, I hope," cries the squire, "that I have
taught her any such things." "Your ignorance, brother," returned she,
"as the great Milton says, almost subdues my patience."[*] "D--n
Milton!" answered the squire: "if he had the impudence to say so to my
face, I'd lend him a douse, thof he was never so great a man.
Patience! An you come to that, sister, I have more occasion of
patience, to be used like an overgrown schoolboy, as I am by you. Do
you think no one hath any understanding, unless he hath been about at
court. Pox! the world is come to a fine pass indeed, if we are all
fools, except a parcel of round-heads and Hanover rats. Pox! I hope
the times are a coming when we shall make fools of them, and every man
shall enjoy his own. That's all, sister; and every man shall enjoy his
own. I hope to zee it, sister, before the Hanover rats have eat up all
our corn, and left us nothing but turneps to feed upon."--"Iat all to repent of what he had done, and gave me reason
to fear he would soon make a second attempt of the like horrible kind.

"When I had finished my discourse, instead of endeavouring to answer
my arguments, he looked me stedfastly in the face, and with a smile
said, `You are strangely altered, my good friend, since I remember
you. I question whether any of our bishops could make a better
argument against suicide than you have entertained me with; but unless
you can find somebody who will lend me a cool hundred, I must either
hang, or drown, or starve; and, in my opinion, the last death is the
most terrible of the three.'

"I answered him very gravely that I was indeed altered since I had
seen him last. That I had found leisure to look into my follies and to
repent of them. I then advised him to pursue the same steps; and at
last concluded with an assurance that I myself would lend him a
hundred pound, if it would be of any service to his affairs, and he
would not put it into the power of a die to deprive him of it.

"Mr Watson, who seemed almost composed in slumber by the former part
of my discourse, was roused by the latter. He seized my hand eagerly,
gave me a thousand thanks, and declared I was a friend indeed; adding
that he hoped I had a better opinion of him than to imagine he had
profited so little by experience, as to put any confidence in those
damned dice which had so often deceived him. `No, no,' cries he; `let
me but once handsomely be set up again, and if ever Fortune makes a
broken merchant of me afterwards, I will forgive her.'

"I very well understood the language of setting up, and broken
merchant. I therefore said to him, with a very grave face, Mr Watson,
you must endeavour to find out some business or employment, by which
you may procure yourself a livelihood; and I promise you, could I see
any probability of being repaid hereafter, I would advance a much
larger sum than what you have mentioned, to equip you in any fair and
honourable calling; but as to gaming, besides the baseness and
wickedness of making it a profession, you are really, to my own
knowledge, unfit for it, and it will end in your certain ruin.

"`Why now, that's strange,' answered he; `neither you, nor any of my
friends, would ever allow me to know anything of the matter, and yet I
believe I _am_ as good a hand at every game as any of you all; and I
heartily wish I was to play with you only for your whole fortune: I
should desire no better sport, and I would let you name your game into
the bargain: but come, my dear boy, have you the hundred in your
pocket?"

"I answered I had only a bill for £50, which I delivered him, and
promised to bring him the rest next morning; and after giving him a
little more advice, took my leave.

"I was indeed better than my word; for I returned to him that very
afternoon. When I entered the room, I found him sitting up in his bed
at cards with a notorious gamester. This sight, you will imagine,
shocked me not a little; to which I may add the mortification of
seeing my bill delivered by him to his antagonist, and thirty guineas
only given in exchange for it.

"The other gamester presently quitted the room, and then Watson
declared he was ashamed to see me; `but,' says he, `I find luck runs
so damnably against me, that I will resolve to leave off play for
ever. I have thought of the kind proposal you made me ever since, and
I promise you there shall be no fault in me, if I do not put it in
execution.'

"Though I had no great faith in his promises, I produced him the
remainder of the hundred in consequence of my own; for which he gave
me a note, which was all I ever expected to see in return for my
money.

"We were prevented from any further discourse at present by the
arrival of the apothecary; who, with much joy in his countenance, and
without even asking his patient how he did, proclaimed there was great
news arrived in a letter to himself, which he said would shortly be
public, `That the Duke of Monmouth was landed in the west with a vast
army of Dutch; and that another vast fleet hovered over the coast of
Norfolk, and was to make a descent there, in order to favour the
duke's enterprize with a diversion on that side.'

"This apothecary was one of the greatest politicians of his time. He
was more delighted with the most paultry packet, than with the best
patient, and the highest joy he was capable of, he received from
having a piece of news in his possession an hour or two sooner than
any other person in the town. His advices, however, were seldom
authentic; for he would swallow almost anything as a truth--a humour
which many made use of to impose upon him.

"Thus it happened with what he at present communicated; for it was
known within a short time afterwards that the duke was really landed,
but that his army consisted only of a few attendants; and as to the
diversion in Norfolk, it was entirely false.

"The apothecary staid no longer in the room than while he acquainted
us with his news; and then, without saying a syllable to his patient
on any other subject, departed to spread his advices all over the
town.

"Events of this nature in the public are generally apt to eclipse all
private concerns. Our discourse therefore now became entirely
political.[*] For my own part, I had been for some time very seriously
affected with the danger to which the Protestant religion was so
visibly exposed under a Popish prince, and thought the apprehension of
it alone sufficient to justify that insurrection; for no real security
can ever be found against the persecuting spirit of Popery, when armed
with power, except the depriving it of that power, as woeful
experience presently showed. You know how King James behaved after
getting the better of this attempt; how little he valued either his
royal word, or coronation oath, or the liberties and rights of his
people. But all had not the sense to foresee this at first; and
therefore the Duke of Monmouth was weakly supported; yet all could
feel when the evil came upon them; and therefore all united, at last,
to drive out that king, against whose exclusion a great party among us
had so warmly contended during the reign of his brother, and for whom
they now fought with such zeal and affection."

"What you say," interrupted Jones, "is very true; and it has often
struck me, as the most wonderful thing I ever read of in history, that
so soon after this convincing experience which brought our whole
nation to join so unanimously in expelling King James, for the
preservation of our religion and liberties, there should be a party
among us mad enough to desire the placing his family again on the
throne." "You are not in earnest!" answered the old man; "there can be
no such party. As bad an opinion as I have of mankind, I cannot
believe them infatuated to such a degree. There may be some hot-headed
Papists led by their priests to engage in this desperate cause, and
think it a holy war; but that Protestants, that are members of the
Church of England, should be such apostates, such _felos de se_, I
cannot believe it; no, no, young man, unacquainted as I am with what
has past in the world for these last thirty years, I cannot be so
imposed upon as to credit so foolish a tale; but I see you have a mind
to sport with my ignorance."--"Can it be possible," replied Jones,
"that you have lived so much out of the world as not to know that
during that time there have been two rebellions in favour of the son
of King James, one of which is now actually raging in the very heart
of the kingdom." At these words the old gentleman started up, and in a
most solemn tone of voice, conjured Jones by his Maker to tell him if
what he said was really true; which the other as solemnly affirming,
he walked several turns about the room in a profound silence, then
cried, then laughed, and at last fell down on his knees, and blessed
God, in a loud thanksgiving prayer, for having delivered him from all
society with human nature, which could be capable of such monstrous
extravagances. After which, being reminded by Jones that he had broke
off his story, he resumed it again in this manner:--

"As mankind, in the days I was speaking of, was not yet arrived at
that pitch of madness which I find they are capable of now, and which,
to be sure, I have only escaped by living alone, and at a distance
from the contagion, there was a considerable rising in favour of
Monmouth; and my principles strongly inclining me to take the same
part, I determined to join him; and Mr Watson, from different motives
concurring in the same resolution (for the spirit of a gamester will
carry a man as far upon such an occasion as the spirit of patriotism),
we soon provided ourselves with all necessaries, and went to the duke
at Bridgewater.

"The unfortunate event of this enterprize, you are, I conclude, as
well acquainted with as myself. I escaped, together with Mr Watson,
from the battle at Sedgemore, in which action I received a slight
wound. We rode near forty miles together on the Exeter road, and then
abandoning our horses, scrambled as well as we could through the
fields and bye-roads, till we arrived at a little wild hut on a
common, where a poor old woman took all the care of us she could, and
dressed my wound with salve, which quickly healed it."

"Pray, sir, where was the wound?" says Partridge. The stranger
satisfied him it was in his arm, and then continued his narrative.
"Here, sir," said he, "Mr Watson left me the next morning, in order,
as he pretended, to get us some provision from the town of Collumpton;
but--can I relate it, or can you believe it?--this Mr Watson, this
friend, this base, barbarous, treacherous villain, betrayed me to a
party of horse belonging to King James, and at his return delivered me
into their hands.

"The soldiers, being six in number, had now seized me, and were
conducting me to Taunton gaol; but neither my present situation, nor
the apprehensions of what might happen to me, were half so irksome to
my mind as the company of my false friend, who, having surrendered
himself, was likewise considered as a prisoner, though he was better
treated, as being to make his peace at my expense. He at first
endeavoured to excuse his treachery; but when he received nothing but
scorn and upbraiding from me, he soon changed his note, abused me as
the most atrocious and malicious rebel, and laid all his own guilt to
my charge, who, as he declared, had solicited, and even threatened
him, to make him take up arms against his gracious as well as lawful
sovereign.

"This false evidence (for in reality he had been much the forwarder of
the two) stung me to the quick, and raised an indignation scarce
conceivable by those who have not felt it. However, fortune at length
took pity on me; for as we were got a little beyond Wellington, in a
narrow lane, my guards received a false alarm, that near fifty of the
enemy were at hand; upon which they shifted for themselves, and left
me and my betrayer to do the same. That villain immediately ran from
me, and I am glad he did, or I should have certainly endeavoured,
though I had no arms, to have executed vengeance on his baseness.

"I was now once more at liberty; and immediately withdrawing from the
highway into the fields, I travelled on, scarce knowing which way I
went, and making it my chief care to avoid all public roads and all
towns--nay, even the most homely houses; for I imagined every human
creature whom I saw desirous of betraying me.

"At last, after rambling several days about the country, during which
the fields afforded me the same bed and the same food which nature
bestows on our savage brothers of the creation, I at length arrived at
this place, where the solitude and wildness of the country invited me
to fix my abode. The first person with whom I took up my habitation
was the mother of this old woman, with whom I remained concealed till
the news of the glorious revolution put an end to all my apprehensions
of danger, and gave me an opportunity of once more visiting my own
home, and of enquiring a little into my affairs, which I soon settled
as agreeably to my brother as to myself; having resigned everything to
him, for which he paid me the sum of a thousand pounds, and settled on
me an annuity for life.

"His behaviour in this last instance, as in all others, was selfish
and ungenerous. I could not look on him as my friend, nor indeed did
he desire that I should; so I presently took my leave of him, as well
as of my other acquaintance; and from that day to this, my history is
little better than a blank."

"And is it possible, sir," said Jones, "that you can have resided here
from that day to this?"--"O no, sir," answered the gentleman; "I have
been a great traveller, and there are few parts of Europe with which I
am not acquainted." "I have not, sir," cried Jones, "the assurance to
ask it of you now; indeed it would be cruel, after so much breath as
you have already spent: but you will give me leave to wish for some
further opportunity of hearing the excellent observations which a man
of your sense and knowledge of the world must have made in so long a
course of travels."--"Indeed, young gentleman," answered the stranger,
"I will endeavour to satisfy your curiosity on this head likewise, as
far as I am able." Jones attempted fresh apologies, but was prevented;
and while he and Partridge sat with greedy and impatient ears, the
stranger proceeded as in the next chapter.


  [*] _The rest of this paragraph and the two following paragraphs
  in the first edition were as follows_:

  "For my own part, I had been for some time very seriously affected
  with the danger to which the Protestant religion was so visibly
  exposed, that nothing but the immediate interposition of Providence
  seemed capable of preserving it; for King James had indeed declared
  war against the Protestant cause. He had brought known papists into
  the army and attempted to bring them into the Church and into the
  University. Popish priests swarmed through the nation, appeared
  publicly in their habits, and boasted that they should shortly walk
  in procession through the streets. Our own clergy were forbid to
  preach against popery, and bishops were ordered to supend those who
  did; and to do the business at once an illegal ecclesiastical
  commission was erected, little inferior to an inquisition, of which,
  probably, it was intended to be the ringleader. Thus, as our duty to
  the king can never be called more than our second duty, he had
  discharged us from this by making it incompatible with our
  preserving the first, which is surely to heaven. Besides this, he
  had dissolved his subjects from their allegiance by breaking his
  Coronation Oath, to which their allegiance is annexed; for he had
  imprisoned bishops because they would not give up their religion,
  and turned out judges because they would not absolutely surrender
  the law into his hands; nay, he seized this himself, and when he
  claimed a dispensing power, he declared himself, in fact, as
  absolute as any tyrant ever was or can be. I have recapitulated
  these matters in full lest some of them should have been omitted in
  history; and I think nothing less than such provocations as I have
  here mentioned, nothing less than certain and imminent danger to
  their religion and liberties, can justify or even mitigate the
  dreadful sin of rebellion in any people."

  "I promise you, sir," says Jones, "all these facts, and more, I have
  read in history, but I will tell you a fact which is not yet
  recorded and of which I suppose you are ignorant. There is actually
  now a rebellion on foot in this kingdom in favour of the son of that
  very King James, a professed papist, more bigoted, if possible, than
  his father, and this carried on by Protestants against a king who
  hath never in one single instance made the least invasion on our
  liberties."

  "Prodigious indeed!" answered the stranger. "You tell me what would
  be incredible of a nation which did not deserve the character that
  Virgil gives of a woman, _varium et mutabile semper_. Surely this is
  to be unworthy of the care which Providence seems to have taken of
  us in the preservation of our religion against the powerful designs
  and constant machinations of Popery, a preservation so strange and
  unaccountable that I almost think we may appeal to it as to a
  miracle for the proof of its holiness. Prodigious indeed! A
  Protestant rebellion in favour of a popish prince! The folly of
  mankind is as wonderful as their knavery--But to conclude my story:
  I resolved to take arms in defence of my country, of my religion,
  and my liberty, and Mr. Watson joined in the same resolution. We
  soon provided ourselves with an necessaries and joined the Duke at
  Bridgewater."

  "The unfortunate event of this enterprise you are perhaps better
  acquainted with than myself. I escaped together with Mr. Watson from
  the battle at Sedgemore,...



Chapter xv.

A brief history of Europe; and a curious discourse between Mr Jones
and the Man of the Hill.


"In Italy the landlords are very silent. In France they are more
talkative, but yet civil. In Germany and Holland they are generally
very impertinent. And as for their honesty, I believe it is pretty
equal in all those countries. The _laquais à louange_ are sure to lose
no opportunity of cheating you; and as for the postilions, I think
they are pretty much alike all the world over. These, sir, are the
observations on men which I made in my travels; for these were the
only men I ever conversed with. My design, when I went abroad, was to
divert myself by seeing the wondrous variety of prospects, beasts,
birds, fishes, insects, and vegetables, with which God has been
pleased to enrich the several parts of this globe; a variety which, as
it must give great pleasure to a contemplative beholder, so doth it
admirably display the power, and wisdom, and goodness of the Creator.
Indeed, to say the truth, there is but one work in his whole creation
that doth him any dishonour, and with that I have long since avoided
holding any conversation."

"You will pardon me," cries Jones; "but I have always imagined that
there is in this very work you mention as great variety as in all the
rest; for, besides the difference of inclination, customs and climates
have, I am told, introduced the utmost diversity into human nature."

"Very little indeed," answered the other: "those who travel in order
to acquaint themselves with the different manners of men might spare
themselves much pains by going to a carnival at Venice; for there they
will see at once all which they can discover in the several courts of
Europe. The same hypocrisy, the same fraud; in short, the same follies
and vices dressed in different habits. In Spain, these are equipped
with much gravity; and in Italy, with vast splendor. In France, a
knave is dressed like a fop; and in the northern countries, like a
sloven. But human nature is everywhere the same, everywhere the object
of detestation and scorn.

"As for my own part, I past through all these nations as you perhaps
may have done through a croud at a shew-jostling to get by them,
holding my nose with one hand, and defending my pockets with the
other, without speaking a word to any of them, while I was pressing on
to see what I wanted to see; which, however entertaining it might be
in itself, scarce made me amends for the trouble the company gave me."

"Did not you find some of the nations among which you travelled less
troublesome to you than others?" said Jones. "O yes," replied the old
man: "the Turks were much more tolerable to me than the Christians;
for they are men of profound taciturnity, and never disturb a stranger
with questions. Now and then indeed they bestow a short curse upon
him, or spit in his face as he walks the streets, but then they have
done with him; and a man may live an age in their country without
hearing a dozen words from them. But of all the people I ever saw,
heaven defend me from the French! With their damned prate and
civilities, and doing the honour of their nation to strangers (as they
are pleased to call it), but indeed setting forth their own vanity;
they are so troublesome, that I had infinitely rather pass my life
with the Hottentots than set my foot in Paris again. They are a nasty
people, but their nastiness is mostly without; whereas, in France, and
some other nations that I won't name, it is all within, and makes them
stink much more to my reason than that of Hottentots does to my nose.

"Thus, sir, I have ended the history of my life; for as to all that
series of years during which I have lived retired here, it affords no
variety to entertain you, and may be almost considered as one
day.[*] The retirement has been so compleat, that I could hardly have
enjoyed a more absolute solitude in the deserts of the Thebais than
here in the midst of this populous kingdom. As I have no estate, I am
plagued with no tenants or stewards: my annuity is paid me pretty
regularly, as indeed it ought to be; for it is much less than what I
might have expected in return for what I gave up. Visits I admit none;
and the old woman who keeps my house knows that her place entirely
depends upon her saving me all the trouble of buying the things that I
want, keeping off all sollicitation or business from me, and holding
her tongue whenever I am within hearing. As my walks are all by night,
I am pretty secure in this wild unfrequented place from meeting any
company. Some few persons I have met by chance, and sent them home
heartily frighted, as from the oddness of my dress and figure they
took me for a ghost or a hobgoblin. But what has happened to-night
shows that even here I cannot be safe from the villany of men; for
without your assistance I had not only been robbed, but very probably
murdered."

  [*] the rest of this paragraph is omitted in the third edition

Jones thanked the stranger for the trouble he had taken in relating
his story, and then expressed some wonder how he could possibly endure
a life of such solitude; "in which," says he, "you may well complain
of the want of variety. Indeed I am astonished how you have filled up,
or rather killed, so much of your time."

"I am not at all surprized," answered the other, "that to one whose
affections and thoughts are fixed on the world my hours should appear
to have wanted employment in this place: but there is one single act,
for which the whole life of man is infinitely too short: what time can
suffice for the contemplation and worship of that glorious, immortal,
and eternal Being, among the works of whose stupendous creation not
only this globe, but even those numberless luminaries which we may
here behold spangling all the sky, though they should many of them be
suns lighting different systems of worlds, may possibly appear but as
a few atoms opposed to the whole earth which we inhabit? Can a man who
by divine meditations is admitted as it were into the conversation of
this ineffable, incomprehensible Majesty, think days, or years, or
ages, too long for the continuance of so ravishing an honour? Shall
the trifling amusements, the palling pleasures, the silly business of
the world, roll away our hours too swiftly from us; and shall the pace
of time seem sluggish to a mind exercised in studies so high, so
important, and so glorious? As no time is sufficient, so no place is
improper, for this great concern. On what object can we cast our eyes
which may not inspire us with ideas of his power, of his wisdom, and
of his goodness? It is not necessary that the rising sun should dart
his fiery glories over the eastern horizon; nor that the boisterous
winds should rush from their caverns, and shake the lofty forest; nor
that the opening clouds should pour their deluges on the plains: it is
not necessary, I say, that any of these should proclaim his majesty:
there is not an insect, not a vegetable, of so low an order in the
creation as not to be honoured with bearing marks of the attributes of
its great Creator; marks not only of his power, but of his wisdom and
goodness. Man alone, the king of this globe, the last and greatest
work of the Supreme Being, below the sun; man alone hath basely
dishonoured his own nature; and by dishonesty, cruelty, ingratitude,
and treachery, hath called his Maker's goodness in question, by
puzzling us to account how a benevolent being should form so foolish
and so vile an animal. Yet this is the being from whose conversation
you think, I suppose, that I have been unfortunately restrained, and
without whose blessed society, life, in your opinion, must be tedious
and insipid."

"In the former part of what you said," replied Jones, "I most heartily
and readily concur; but I believe, as well as hope, that the
abhorrence which you express for mankind in the conclusion, is much
too general. Indeed, you here fall into an error, which in my little
experience I have observed to be a very common one, by taking the
character of mankind from the worst and basest among them; whereas,
indeed, as an excellent writer observes, nothing should be esteemed as
characteristical of a species, but what is to be found among the best
and most perfect individuals of that species. This error, I believe,
is generally committed by those who from want of proper caution in the
choice of their friends and acquaintance, have suffered injuries from
bad and worthless men; two or three instances of which are very
unjustly charged on all human nature."

"I think I had experience enough of it," answered the other: "my first
mistress and my first friend betrayed me in the basest manner, and in
matters which threatened to be of the worst of consequences--even to
bring me to a shameful death."

"But you will pardon me," cries Jones, "if I desire you to reflect who
that mistress and who that friend were. What better, my good sir,
could be expected in love derived from the stews, or in friendship
first produced and nourished at the gaming-table? To take the
characters of women from the former instance, or of men from the
latter, would be as unjust as to assert that air is a nauseous and
unwholesome element, because we find it so in a jakes. I have lived
but a short time in the world, and yet have known men worthy of the
highest friendship, and women of the highest love."

"Alas! young man," answered the stranger, "you have lived, you
confess, but a very short time in the world: I was somewhat older than
you when I was of the same opinion."

"You might have remained so still," replies Jones, "if you had not
been unfortunate, I will venture to say incautious, in the placing
your affections. If there was, indeed, much more wickedness in the
world than there is, it would not prove such general assertions
against human nature, since much of this arrives by mere accident, and
many a man who commits evil is not totally bad and corrupt in his
heart. In truth, none seem to have any title to assert human nature to
be necessarily and universally evil, but those whose own minds afford
them one instance of this natural depravity; which is not, I am
convinced, your case."

"And such," said the stranger, "will be always the most backward to
assert any such thing. Knaves will no more endeavour to persuade us of
the baseness of mankind, than a highwayman will inform you that there
are thieves on the road. This would, indeed, be a method to put you on
your guard, and to defeat their own purposes. For which reason, though
knaves, as I remember, are very apt to abuse particular persons, yet
they never cast any reflection on human nature in general." The old
gentleman spoke this so warmly, that as Jones despaired of making a
convert, and was unwilling to offend, he returned no answer.

The day now began to send forth its first streams of light, when Jones
made an apology to the stranger for having staid so long, and perhaps
detained him from his rest. The stranger answered, "He never wanted
rest less than at present; for that day and night were indifferent
seasons to him; and that he commonly made use of the former for the
time of his repose and of the latter for his walks and lucubrations.
However," said he, "it is now a most lovely morning, and if you can
bear any longer to be without your own rest or food, I will gladly
entertain you with the sight of some very fine prospects which I
believe you have not yet seen."

Jones very readily embraced this offer, and they immediately set
forward together from the cottage. As for Partridge, he had fallen
into a profound repose just as the stranger had finished his story;
for his curiosity was satisfied, and the subsequent discourse was not
forcible enough in its operation to conjure down the charms of sleep.
Jones therefore left him to enjoy his nap; and as the reader may
perhaps be at this season glad of the same favour, we will here put an
end to the eighth book of our history.




BOOK IX.

CONTAINING TWELVE HOURS.



Chapter i.

Of those who lawfully may, and of those who may not, write such
histories as this.


Among other good uses for which I have thought proper to institute
these several introductory chapters, I have considered them as a kind
of mark or stamp, which may hereafter enable a very indifferent reader
to distinguish what is true and genuine in this historic kind of
writing, from what is false and counterfeit. Indeed, it seems likely
that some such mark may shortly become necessary, since the favourable
reception which two or three authors have lately procured for their
works of this nature from the public, will probably serve as an
encouragement to many others to undertake the like. Thus a swarm of
foolish novels and monstrous romances will be produced, either to the
great impoverishing of booksellers, or to the great loss of time and
depravation of morals in the reader; nay, often to the spreading of
scandal and calumny, and to the prejudice of the characters of many
worthy and honest people.

I question not but the ingenious author of the Spectator was
principally induced to prefix Greek and Latin mottos to every paper,
from the same consideration of guarding against the pursuit of those
scribblers, who having no talents of a writer but what is taught by
the writing-master, are yet nowise afraid nor ashamed to assume the
same titles with the greatest genius, than their good brother in the
fable was of braying in the lion's skin.

By the device therefore of his motto, it became impracticable for any
man to presume to imitate the Spectators, without understanding at
least one sentence in the learned languages. In the same manner I have
now secured myself from the imitation of those who are utterly
incapable of any degree of reflection, and whose learning is not equal
to an essay.

I would not be here understood to insinuate, that the greatest merit
of such historical productions can ever lie in these introductory
chapters; but, in fact, those parts which contain mere narrative only,
afford much more encouragement to the pen of an imitator, than those
which are composed of observation and reflection. Here I mean such
imitators as Rowe was of Shakespear, or as Horace hints some of the
Romans were of Cato, by bare feet and sour faces.

To invent good stories, and to tell them well, are possibly very rare
talents, and yet I have observed few persons who have scrupled to aim
at both: and if we examine the romances and novels with which the
world abounds, I think we may fairly conclude, that most of the
authors would not have attempted to show their teeth (if the
expression may be allowed me) in any other way of writing; nor could
indeed have strung together a dozen sentences on any other subject
whatever.

     _Scribimus indocti doctique passim_,[*]

     [*] --Each desperate blockhead dares to write:
     Verse is the trade of every living wight.--FRANCIS.

may be more truly said of the historian and biographer, than of any
other species of writing; for all the arts and sciences (even
criticism itself) require some little degree of learning and
knowledge. Poetry, indeed, may perhaps be thought an exception; but
then it demands numbers, or something like numbers: whereas, to the
composition of novels and romances, nothing is necessary but paper,
pens, and ink, with the manual capacity of using them. This, I
conceive, their productions show to be the opinion of the authors
themselves: and this must be the opinion of their readers, if indeed
there be any such.

Hence we are to derive that universal contempt which the world, who
always denominate the whole from the majority, have cast on all
historical writers who do not draw their materials from records. And
it is the apprehension of this contempt that hath made us so
cautiously avoid the term romance, a name with which we might
otherwise have been well enough contented. Though, as we have good
authority for all our characters, no less indeed than the vast
authentic doomsday-book of nature, as is elsewhere hinted, our labours
have sufficient title to the name of history. Certainly they deserve
some distinction from those works, which one of the wittiest of men
regarded only as proceeding from a _pruritus_, or indeed rather from a
looseness of the brain.

But besides the dishonour which is thus cast on one of the most useful
as well as entertaining of all kinds of writing, there is just reason
to apprehend, that by encouraging such authors we shall propagate much
dishonour of another kind; I mean to the characters of many good and
valuable members of society; for the dullest writers, no more than the
dullest companions, are always inoffensive. They have both enough of
language to be indecent and abusive. And surely if the opinion just
above cited be true, we cannot wonder that works so nastily derived
should be nasty themselves, or have a tendency to make others so.

To prevent therefore, for the future, such intemperate abuses of
leisure, of letters, and of the liberty of the press, especially as
the world seems at present to be more than usually threatened with
them, I shall here venture to mention some qualifications, every one
of which are in a pretty high degree necessary to this order of
historians.

The first is, genius, without a full vein of which no study, says
Horace, can avail us. By genius I would understand that power or
rather those powers of the mind, which are capable of penetrating into
all things within our reach and knowledge, and of distinguishing their
essential differences. These are no other than invention and judgment;
and they are both called by the collective name of genius, as they are
of those gifts of nature which we bring with us into the world.
Concerning each of which many seem to have fallen into very great
errors; for by invention, I believe, is generally understood a
creative faculty, which would indeed prove most romance writers to
have the highest pretensions to it; whereas by invention is really
meant no more (and so the word signifies) than discovery, or finding
out; or to explain it at large, a quick and sagacious penetration into
the true essence of all the objects of our contemplation. This, I
think, can rarely exist without the concomitancy of judgment; for how
we can be said to have discovered the true essence of two things,
without discerning their difference, seems to me hard to conceive. Now
this last is the undisputed province of judgment, and yet some few men
of wit have agreed with all the dull fellows in the world in
representing these two to have been seldom or never the property of
one and the same person.

But though they should be so, they are not sufficient for our purpose,
without a good share of learning; for which I could again cite the
authority of Horace, and of many others, if any was necessary to prove
that tools are of no service to a workman, when they are not sharpened
by art, or when he wants rules to direct him in his work, or hath no
matter to work upon. All these uses are supplied by learning; for
nature can only furnish us with capacity; or, as I have chose to
illustrate it, with the tools of our profession; learning must fit
them for use, must direct them in it, and, lastly, must contribute
part at least of the materials. A competent knowledge of history and
of the belles-lettres is here absolutely necessary; and without this
share of knowledge at least, to affect the character of an historian,
is as vain as to endeavour at building a house without timber or
mortar, or brick or stone. Homer and Milton, who, though they added
the ornament of numbers to their works, were both historians of our
order, were masters of all the learning of their times.

Again, there is another sort of knowledge, beyond the power of
learning to bestow, and this is to be had by conversation. So
necessary is this to the understanding the characters of men, that
none are more ignorant of them than those learned pedants whose lives
have been entirely consumed in colleges, and among books; for however
exquisitely human nature may have been described by writers, the true
practical system can be learnt only in the world. Indeed the like
happens in every other kind of knowledge. Neither physic nor law are
to be practically known from books. Nay, the farmer, the planter, the
gardener, must perfect by experience what he hath acquired the
rudiments of by reading. How accurately soever the ingenious Mr Miller
may have described the plant, he himself would advise his disciple to
see it in the garden. As we must perceive, that after the nicest
strokes of a Shakespear or a Jonson, of a Wycherly or an Otway, some
touches of nature will escape the reader, which the judicious action
of a Garrick, of a Cibber, or a Clive,[*] can convey to him; so, on the
real stage, the character shows himself in a stronger and bolder light
than he can be described. And if this be the case in those fine and
nervous descriptions which great authors themselves have taken from
life, how much more strongly will it hold when the writer himself
takes his lines not from nature, but from books? Such characters are
only the faint copy of a copy, and can have neither the justness nor
spirit of an original.

  [*] There is a peculiar propriety in mentioning this great actor,
  and these two most justly celebrated actresses, in this place, as
  they have all formed themselves on the study of nature only, and not
  on the imitation of their predecessors. Hence they have been able to
  excel all who have gone before them; a degree of merit which the
  servile herd of imitators can never possibly arrive at.

Now this conversation in our historian must be universal, that is,
with all ranks and degrees of men; for the knowledge of what is called
high life will not instruct him in low; nor, _e converso_, will his
being acquainted with the inferior part of mankind teach him the
manners of the superior. And though it may be thought that the
knowledge of either may sufficiently enable him to describe at least
that in which he hath been conversant, yet he will even here fall
greatly short of perfection; for the follies of either rank do in
reality illustrate each other. For instance, the affectation of high
life appears more glaring and ridiculous from the simplicity of the
low; and again, the rudeness and barbarity of this latter, strikes
with much stronger ideas of absurdity, when contrasted with, and
opposed to, the politeness which controuls the former. Besides, to say
the truth, the manners of our historian will be improved by both these
conversations; for in the one he will easily find examples of
plainness, honesty, and sincerity; in the other of refinement,
elegance, and a liberality of spirit; which last quality I myself have
scarce ever seen in men of low birth and education.

Nor will all the qualities I have hitherto given my historian avail
him, unless he have what is generally meant by a good heart, and be
capable of feeling. The author who will make me weep, says Horace,
must first weep himself. In reality, no man can paint a distress well
which he doth not feel while he is painting it; nor do I doubt, but
that the most pathetic and affecting scenes have been writ with tears.
In the same manner it is with the ridiculous. I am convinced I never
make my reader laugh heartily but where I have laughed before him;
unless it should happen at any time, that instead of laughing with me
he should be inclined to laugh at me. Perhaps this may have been the
case at some passages in this chapter, from which apprehension I will
here put an end to it.



Chapter ii.

Containing a very surprizing adventure indeed, which Mr Jones met with
in his walk with the Man of the Hill.


Aurora now first opened her casement, _Anglice_ the day began to
break, when Jones walked forth in company with the stranger, and
mounted Mazard Hill; of which they had no sooner gained the summit
than one of the most noble prospects in the world presented itself to
their view, and which we would likewise present to the reader, but for
two reasons: first, we despair of making those who have seen this
prospect admire our description; secondly, we very much doubt whether
those who have not seen it would understand it.

Jones stood for some minutes fixed in one posture, and directing his
eyes towards the south; upon which the old gentleman asked, What he
was looking at with so much attention? "Alas! sir," answered he with a
sigh, "I was endeavouring to trace out my own journey hither. Good
heavens! what a distance is Gloucester from us! What a vast track of
land must be between me and my own home!"--"Ay, ay, young gentleman,"
cries the other, "and by your sighing, from what you love better than
your own home, or I am mistaken. I perceive now the object of your
contemplation is not within your sight, and yet I fancy you have a
pleasure in looking that way." Jones answered with a smile, "I find,
old friend, you have not yet forgot the sensations of your youth. I
own my thoughts were employed as you have guessed."

They now walked to that part of the hill which looks to the
north-west, and which hangs over a vast and extensive wood. Here they
were no sooner arrived than they heard at a distance the most violent
screams of a woman, proceeding from the wood below them. Jones
listened a moment, and then, without saying a word to his companion
(for indeed the occasion seemed sufficiently pressing), ran, or rather
slid, down the hill, and, without the least apprehension or concern
for his own safety, made directly to the thicket, whence the sound had
issued.

He had not entered far into the wood before he beheld a most shocking
sight indeed, a woman stript half naked, under the hands of a ruffian,
who had put his garter round her neck, and was endeavouring to draw
her up to a tree. Jones asked no questions at this interval, but fell
instantly upon the villain, and made such good use of his trusty oaken
stick that he laid him sprawling on the ground before he could defend
himself, indeed almost before he knew he was attacked; nor did he
cease the prosecution of his blows till the woman herself begged him
to forbear, saying, she believed he had sufficiently done his
business.

The poor wretch then fell upon her knees to Jones, and gave him a
thousand thanks for her deliverance. He presently lifted her up, and
told her he was highly pleased with the extraordinary accident which
had sent him thither for her relief, where it was so improbable she
should find any; adding, that Heaven seemed to have designed him as
the happy instrument of her protection. "Nay," answered she, "I could
almost conceive you to be some good angel; and, to say the truth, you
look more like an angel than a man in my eye." Indeed he was a
charming figure; and if a very fine person, and a most comely set of
features, adorned with youth, health, strength, freshness, spirit, and
good-nature, can make a man resemble an angel, he certainly had that
resemblance.

The redeemed captive had not altogether so much of the human-angelic
species: she seemed to be at least of the middle age, nor had her face
much appearance of beauty; but her cloaths being torn from all the
upper part of her body, her breasts, which were well formed and
extremely white, attracted the eyes of her deliverer, and for a few
moments they stood silent, and gazing at each other; till the ruffian
on the ground beginning to move, Jones took the garter which had been
intended for another purpose, and bound both his hands behind him. And
now, on contemplating his face, he discovered, greatly to his
surprize, and perhaps not a little to his satisfaction, this very
person to be no other than ensign Northerton. Nor had the ensign
forgotten his former antagonist, whom he knew the moment he came to
himself. His surprize was equal to that of Jones; but I conceive his
pleasure was rather less on this occasion.

Jones helped Northerton upon his legs, and then looking him stedfastly
in the face, "I fancy, sir," said he, "you did not expect to meet me
any more in this world, and I confess I had as little expectation to
find you here. However, fortune, I see, hath brought us once more
together, and hath given me satisfaction for the injury I have
received, even without my own knowledge."

"It is very much like a man of honour, indeed," answered Northerton,
"to take satisfaction by knocking a man down behind his back. Neither
am I capable of giving you satisfaction here, as I have no sword; but
if you dare behave like a gentleman, let us go where I can furnish
myself with one, and I will do by you as a man of honour ought."

"Doth it become such a villain as you are," cries Jones, "to
contaminate the name of honour by assuming it? But I shall waste no
time in discourse with you. Justice requires satisfaction of you now,
and shall have it." Then turning to the woman, he asked her, if she
was near her home; or if not, whether she was acquainted with any
house in the neighbourhood, where she might procure herself some
decent cloaths, in order to proceed to a justice of the peace.

She answered she was an entire stranger in that part of the world.
Jones then recollecting himself, said, he had a friend near who would
direct them; indeed, he wondered at his not following; but, in fact,
the good Man of the Hill, when our heroe departed, sat himself down on
the brow, where, though he had a gun in his hand, he with great
patience and unconcern had attended the issue.

Jones then stepping without the wood, perceived the old man sitting as
we have just described him; he presently exerted his utmost agility,
and with surprizing expedition ascended the hill.

The old man advised him to carry the woman to Upton, which, he said,
was the nearest town, and there he would be sure of furnishing her
with all manner of conveniencies. Jones having received his direction
to the place, took his leave of the Man of the Hill, and, desiring him
to direct Partridge the same way, returned hastily to the wood.

Our heroe, at his departure to make this enquiry of his friend, had
considered, that as the ruffian's hands were tied behind him, he was
incapable of executing any wicked purposes on the poor woman. Besides,
he knew he should not be beyond the reach of her voice, and could
return soon enough to prevent any mischief. He had moreover declared
to the villain, that if he attempted the least insult, he would be
himself immediately the executioner of vengeance on him. But Jones
unluckily forgot, that though the hands of Northerton were tied, his
legs were at liberty; nor did he lay the least injunction on the
prisoner that he should not make what use of these he pleased.
Northerton therefore having given no parole of that kind, thought he
might without any breach of honour depart; not being obliged, as he
imagined, by any rules, to wait for a formal discharge. He therefore
took up his legs, which were at liberty, and walked off through the
wood, which favoured his retreat; nor did the woman, whose eyes were
perhaps rather turned toward her deliverer, once think of his escape,
or give herself any concern or trouble to prevent it.

Jones therefore, at his return, found the woman alone. He would have
spent some time in searching for Northerton, but she would not permit
him; earnestly entreating that he would accompany her to the town
whither they had been directed. "As to the fellow's escape," said she,
"it gives me no uneasiness; for philosophy and Christianity both
preach up forgiveness of injuries. But for you, sir, I am concerned at
the trouble I give you; nay, indeed, my nakedness may well make me
ashamed to look you in the face; and if it was not for the sake of
your protection, I should wish to go alone."

Jones offered her his coat; but, I know not for what reason, she
absolutely refused the most earnest solicitations to accept it. He
then begged her to forget both the causes of her confusion. "With
regard to the former," says he, "I have done no more than my duty in
protecting you; and as for the latter, I will entirely remove it, by
walking before you all the way; for I would not have my eyes offend
you, and I could not answer for my power of resisting the attractive
charms of so much beauty."

Thus our heroe and the redeemed lady walked in the same manner as
Orpheus and Eurydice marched heretofore; but though I cannot believe
that Jones was designedly tempted by his fair one to look behind him,
yet as she frequently wanted his assistance to help her over stiles,
and had besides many trips and other accidents, he was often obliged
to turn about. However, he had better fortune than what attended poor
Orpheus, for he brought his companion, or rather follower, safe into
the famous town of Upton.



Chapter iii.

The arrival of Mr Jones with his lady at the inn; with a very full
description of the battle of Upton.


Though the reader, we doubt rected her guide to travel through bye-roads, across
the country, they now passed the Severn, and had scarce got a mile
from the inn, when the young lady, looking behind her, saw several
horses coming after on full speed. This greatly alarmed her fears, and
she called to the guide to put on as fast as possible.

He immediately obeyed her, and away they rode a full gallop. But the
faster they went, the faster were they followed; and as the horses
behind were somewhat swifter than those before, so the former were at
length overtaken. A happy circumstance for poor Sophia; whose fears,
joined to her fatigue, had almost overpowered her spirits; but she was
now instantly relieved by a female voice, that greeted her in the
softest manner, and with the utmost civility. This greeting Sophia, as
soon as she could recover her breath, with like civility, and with the
highest satisfaction to herself, returned.

The travellers who joined Sophia, and who had given her such terror,
consisted, like her own company, of two females and a guide. The two
parties proceeded three full miles together before any one offered
again to open their mouths; when our heroine, having pretty well got
the better of her fear (but yet being somewhat surprized that the
other still continued to attend her, as she pursued no great road, and
had already passed through several turnings), accosted the strange
lady in a most obliging tone, and said, "She was very happy to find
they were both travelling the same way." The other, who, like a ghost,
only wanted to be spoke to, readily answered, "That the happiness was
entirely hers; that she was a perfect stranger in that country, and
was so overjoyed at meeting a companion of her own sex, that she had
perhaps been guilty of an impertinence, which required great apology,
in keeping pace with her." More civilities passed between these two
ladies; for Mrs Honour had now given place to the fine habit of the
stranger, and had fallen into the rear. But, though Sophia had great
curiosity to know why the other lady continued to travel on through
the same bye-roads with herself, nay, though this gave her some
uneasiness, yet fear, or modesty, or some other consideration,
restrained her from asking the question.

The strange lady now laboured under a difficulty which appears almost
below the dignity of history to mention. Her bonnet had been blown
from her head not less than five times within the last mile; nor could
she come at any ribbon or handkerchief to tie it under her chin. When
Sophia was informed of this, she immediately supplied her with a
handkerchief for this purpose; which while she was pulling from her
pocket, she perhaps too much neglected the management of her horse,
for the beast, now unluckily making a false step, fell upon his
fore-legs, and threw his fair rider from his back.

Though Sophia came head foremost to the ground, she happily received
not the least damage: and the same circumstances which had perhaps
contributed to her fall now preserved her from confusion; for the lane
which they were then passing was narrow, and very much overgrown with
trees, so that the moon could here afford very little light, and was
moreover, at present, so obscured in a cloud, that it was almost
perfectly dark. By these means the young lady's modesty, which was
extremely delicate, escaped as free from injury as her limbs, and she
was once more reinstated in her saddle, having received no other harm
than a little fright by her fall.

Daylight at length appeared in its full lustre; and now the two
ladies, who were riding over a common side by side, looking stedfastly
at each other, at the same moment both their eyes became fixed; both
their horses stopt, and, both speaking together, with equal joy
pronounced, the one the name of Sophia, the other that of Harriet.

This unexpected encounter surprized the ladies much more than I
believe it will the sagacious reader, who must have imagined that the
strange lady could be no other than Mrs Fitzpatrick, the cousin of
Miss Western, whom we before mentioned to have sallied from the inn a
few minutes after her.

So great was the surprize and joy which these two cousins conceived at
this meeting (for they had formerly been most intimate acquaintance
and friends, and had long lived together with their aunt Western),
that it is impossible to recount half the congratulations which passed
between them, before either asked a very natural question of the
other, namely, whither she was going?

This at last, however, came first from Mrs Fitzpatrick; but, easy and
natural as the question may seem, Sophia found it difficult to give it
a very ready and certain answer. She begged her cousin therefore to
suspend all curiosity till they arrived at some inn, "which I
suppose," says she, "can hardly be far distant; and, believe me,
Harriet, I suspend as much curiosity on my side; for, indeed, I
believe our astonishment is pretty equal."

The conversation which passed between these ladies on the road was, I
apprehend, little worth relating; and less certainly was that between
the two waiting-women; for they likewise began to pay their
compliments to each other. As for the guides, they were debarred from
the pleasure of discourse, the one being placed in the van, and the
other obliged to bring up the rear.

In this posture they travelled many hours, till they came into a wide
and well-beaten road, which, as they turned to the right, soon brought
them to a very fair promising inn, where they all alighted: but so
fatigued was Sophia, that as she had sat her horse during the last
five or six miles with great difficulty, so was she now incapable of
dismounting from him without assistance. This the landlord, who had
hold of her horse, presently perceiving, offered to lift her in his
arms from her saddle; and she too readily accepted the tender of his
service. Indeed fortune seems to have resolved to put Sophia to the
blush that day, and the second malicious attempt succeeded better than
the first; for my landlord had no sooner received the young lady in
his arms, than his feet, which the gout had lately very severely
handled, gave way, and down he tumbled; but, at the same time, with no
less dexterity than gallantry, contrived to throw himself under his
charming burden, so that he alone received any bruise from the fall;
for the great injury which happened to Sophia was a violent shock
given to her modesty by an immoderate grin, which, at her rising from
the ground, she observed in the countenances of most of the
bye-standers. This made her suspect what had really happened, and what
we shall not here relate for the indulgence of those readers who are
capable of laughing at the offence given to a young lady's delicacy.
Accidents of this kind we have never regarded in a comical light; nor
will we scruple to say that he must have a very inadequate idea of the
modesty of a beautiful young woman, who would wish to sacrifice it to
so paltry a satisfaction as can arise from laughter.

This fright and shock, joined to the violent fatigue which both her
mind and body had undergone, almost overcame the excellent
constitution of Sophia, and she had scarce strength sufficient to
totter into the inn, leaning on the arm of her maid. Here she was no
sooner seated than she called for a glass of water; but Mrs Honour,
very judiciously, in my opinion, changed it into a glass of wine.

Mrs Fitzpatrick, hearing from Mrs Honour that Sophia had not been in
bed during the two last nights, and observing her to look very pale
and wan with her fatigue, earnestly entreated her to refresh herself
with some sleep. She was yet a stranger to her history, or her
apprehensions; but, had she known both, she would have given the same
advice; for rest was visibly necessary for her; and their long journey
through bye-roads so entirely removed all danger of pursuit, that she
was herself perfectly easy on that account.

Sophia was easily prevailed on to follow the counsel of her friend,
which was heartily seconded by her maid. Mrs Fitzpatrick likewise
offered to bear her cousin company, which Sophia, with much
complacence, accepted.

The mistress was no sooner in bed than the maid prepared to follow her
example. She began to make many apologies to her sister Abigail for
leaving her alone in so horrid a place as an inn; but the other stopt
her short, being as well inclined to a nap as herself, and desired the
honour of being her bedfellow. Sophia's maid agreed to give her a
share of her bed, but put in her claim to all the honour. So, after
many courtsies and compliments, to bed together went the
waiting-women, as their mistresses had done before them.

It was usual with my landlord (as indeed it is with the whole
fraternity) to enquire particularly of all coachmen, footmen,
postboys, and others, into the names of all his guests; what their
estate was, and where it lay. It cannot therefore be wondered at that
the many particular circumstances which attended our travellers, and
especially their retiring all to sleep at so extraordinary and unusual
an hour as ten in the morning, should excite his curiosity. As soon,
therefore, as the guides entered the kitchen, he began to examine who
the ladies were, and whence they came; but the guides, though they
faithfully related all they knew, gave him very little satisfaction.
On the contrary, they rather enflamed his curiosity than extinguished
it.

This landlord had the character, among all his neighbours, of being a
very sagacious fellow. He was thought to see farther and deeper into
things than any man in the parish, the parson himself not excepted.
Perhaps his look had contributed not a little to procure him this
reputation; for there was in this something wonderfully wise and
significant, especially when he had a pipe in his mouth; which,
indeed, he seldom was without. His behaviour, likewise, greatly
assisted in promoting the opinion of his wisdom. In his deportment he
was solemn, if not sullen; and when he spoke, which was seldom, he
always delivered himself in a slow voice; and, though his sentences
were short, they were still interrupted with many hums and ha's, ay
ays, and other expletives: so that, though he accompanied his words
with certain explanatory gestures, such as shaking or nodding the
head, or pointing with his fore-finger, he generally left his hearers
to understand more than he expressed; nay, he commonly gave them a
hint that he knew much more than he thought proper to disclose. This
last circumstance alone may, indeed, very well account for his
character of wisdom; since men are strangely inclined to worship what
they do not understand. A grand secret, upon which several imposers on
mankind have totally relied for the success of their frauds.

This polite person, now taking his wife aside, asked her "what she
thought of the ladies lately arrived?" "Think of them?" said the wife,
"why, what should I think of them?" "I know," answered he, "what I
think. The guides tell strange stories. One pretends to be come from
Gloucester, and the other from Upton; and neither of them, for what I
can find, can tell whither they are going. But what people ever travel
across the country from Upton hither, especially to London? And one of
the maid-servants, before she alighted from her horse, asked if this
was not the London road? Now I have put all these circumstances
together, and whom do you think I have found them out to be?" "Nay,"
answered she, "you know I never pretend to guess at your
discoveries."----"It is a good girl," replied he, chucking her under
the chin; "I must own you have always submitted to my knowledge of
these matters. Why, then, depend upon it; mind what I say--depend upon
it, they are certainly some of the rebel ladies, who, they say, travel
with the young Chevalier; and have taken a roundabout way to escape
the duke's army."

"Husband," quoth the wife, "you have certainly hit it; for one of them
is dressed as fine as any princess; and, to be sure, she looks for all
the world like one.----But yet, when I consider one thing"----"When
you consider," cries the landlord contemptuously----"Come, pray let's
hear what you consider."----"Why, it is," answered the wife, "that she
is too humble to be any very great lady: for, while our Betty was
warming the bed, she called her nothing but child, and my dear, and
sweetheart; and, when Betty offered to pull off her shoes and
stockings, she would not suffer her, saying, she would not give her
the trouble."

"Pugh!" answered the husband, "that is nothing. Dost think, because
you have seen some great ladies rude and uncivil to persons below
them, that none of them know how to behave themselves when they come
before their inferiors? I think I know people of fashion when I see
them--I think I do. Did not she call for a glass of water when she
came in? Another sort of women would have called for a dram; you know
they would. If she be not a woman of very great quality, sell me for a
fool; and, I believe, those who buy me will have a bad bargain. Now,
would a woman of her quality travel without a footman, unless upon
some such extraordinary occasion?" "Nay, to be sure, husband," cries
she, "you know these matters better than I, or most folk." "I think I
do know something," said he. "To be sure," answered the wife, "the
poor little heart looked so piteous, when she sat down in the chair, I
protest I could not help having a compassion for her almost as much as
if she had been a poor body. But what's to be done, husband? If an she
be a rebel, I suppose you intend to betray her up to the court. Well,
she's a sweet-tempered, good-humoured lady, be she what she will, and
I shall hardly refrain from crying when I hear she is hanged or
beheaded." "Pooh!" answered the husband.----"But, as to what's to be
done, it is not so easy a matter to determine. I hope, before she goes
away, we shall have the news of a battle; for, if the Chevalier should
get the better, she may gain us interest at court, and make our
fortunes without betraying her." "Why, that's true," replied the wife;
"and I heartily hope she will have it in her power. Certainly she's a
sweet good lady; it would go horribly against me to have her come to
any harm." "Pooh!" cries the landlord, "women are always so
tender-hearted. Why, you would not harbour rebels, would you?" "No,
certainly," answered the wife; "and as for betraying her, come what
will on't, nobody can blame us. It is what anybody would do in our
case."

While our politic landlord, who had not, we see, undeservedly the
reputation of great wisdom among his neighbours, was engaged in
debating this matter with himself (for he paid little attention to the
opinion of his wife), news arrived that the rebels had given the duke
the slip, and had got a day's march towards London; and soon after
arrived a famous Jacobite squire, who, with great joy in his
countenance, shook the landlord by the hand, saying, "All's our own,
boy, ten thousand honest Frenchmen are landed in Suffolk. Old England
for ever! ten thousand French, my brave lad! I am going to tap away
directly."

This news determined the opinion of the wise man, and he resolved to
make his court to the young lady when she arose; for he had now (he
said) discovered that she was no other than Madam Jenny Cameron
herself.


Chapter iii.

A very short chapter, in which however is a sun, a moon, a star, and
an angel.


The sun (for he keeps very good hours at this time of the year) had
been some time retired to rest when Sophia arose greatly refreshed by
her sleep; which, short as it was, nothing but her extreme fatigue
could have occasioned; for, though she had told her maid, and perhaps
herself too, that she was perfectly easy when she left Upton, yet it
is certain her mind was a little affected with that malady which is
attended with all the restless symptoms of a fever, and is perhaps the
very distemper which physicians mean (if they mean anything) by the
fever on the spirits.

Mrs Fitzpatrick likewise left her bed at the same time; and, having
summoned her maid, immediately dressed herself. She was really a very
pretty woman, and, had she been in any other company but that of
Sophia, might have been thought beautiful; but when Mrs Honour of her
own accord attended (for her mistress would not suffer her to be
waked), and had equipped our heroine, the charms of Mrs Fitzpatrick,
who had performed the office of the morning-star, and had preceded
greater glories, shared the fate of that star, and were totally
eclipsed the moment those glories shone forth.

Perhaps Sophia never looked more beautiful than she did at this
instant. We ought not, therefore, to condemn the maid of the inn for
her hyperbole, who, when she descended, after having lighted the fire,
declared, and ratified it with an oath, that if ever there was an
angel upon earth, she was now above-stairs.

Sophia had acquainted her cousin with her design to go to London; and
Mrs Fitzpatrick had agreed to accompany her; for the arrival of her
husband at Upton had put an end to her design of going to Bath, or to
her aunt Western. They had therefore no sooner finished their tea than
Sophia proposed to set out, the moon then shining extremely bright,
and as for the frost she defied it; nor had she any of those
apprehensions which many young ladies would have felt at travelling by
night; for she had, as we have before observed, some little degree of
natural courage; and this, her present sensations, which bordered
somewhat on despair, greatly encreased. Besides, as she had already
travelled twice with safety by the light of the moon, she was the
better emboldened to trust to it a third time.

The disposition of Mrs Fitzpatrick was more timorous; for, though the
greater terrors had conquered the less, and the presence of her
husband had driven her away at so unseasonable an hour from Upton,
yet, being now arrived at a place where she thought herself safe from
his pursuit, these lesser terrors of I know not what operated so
strongly, that she earnestly entreated her cousin to stay till the
next morning, and not expose herself to the dangers of travelling by
night.

Sophia, who was yielding to an excess, when she could neither laugh
nor reason her cousin out of these apprehensions, at last gave way to
them. Perhaps, indeed, had she known of her father's arrival at Upton,
it might have been more difficult to have persuaded her; for as to
Jones, she had, I am afraid, no great horror at the thoughts of being
overtaken by him; nay, to confess the truth, I believe she rather
wished than feared it; though I might honestly enough have concealed
this wish from the reader, as it was one of those secret spontaneous
emotions of the soul to which the reason is often a stranger.

When our young ladies had determined to remain all that evening in
their inn they were attended by the landlady, who desired to know what
their ladyships would be pleased to eat. Such charms were there in the
voice, in the manner, and in the affable deportment of Sophia, that
she ravished the landlady to the highest degree; and that good woman,
concluding that she had attended Jenny Cameron, became in a moment a
stanch Jacobite, and wished heartily well to the young Pretender's
cause, from the great sweetness and affability with which she had been
treated by his supposed mistress.

The two cousins began now to impart to each other their reciprocal
curiosity to know what extraordinary accidents on both sides
occasioned this so strange and unexpected meeting. At last Mrs
Fitzpatrick, having obtained of Sophia a promise of communicating
likewise in her turn, began to relate what the reader, if he is
desirous to know her history, may read in the ensuing chapter.



Chapter iv.

The history of Mrs Fitzpatrick.


Mrs Fitzpatrick, after a silence of a few moments, fetching a deep
sigh, thus began:

"It is natural to the unhappy to feel a secret concern in recollecting
those periods of their lives which have been most delightful to them.
The remembrance of past pleasures affects us with a kind of tender
grief, like what we suffer for departed friends; and the ideas of both
may be said to haunt our imaginations.

"For this reason, I never reflect without sorrow on those days (the
happiest far of my life) which we spent together when both were under
the care of my aunt Western. Alas! why are Miss Graveairs and Miss
Giddy no more? You remember, I am sure, when we knew each other by no
other names. Indeed, you gave the latter appellation with too much
cause. I have since experienced how much I deserved it. You, my
Sophia, was always my superior in everything, and I heartily hope you
will be so in your fortune. I shall never forget the wise and matronly
advice you once gave me, when I lamented being disappointed of a ball,
though you could not be then fourteen years old.----O my Sophy, how
blest must have been my situation, when I could think such a
disappointment a misfortune; and when indeed it was the greatest I had
ever known!"

"And yet, my dear Harriet," answered Sophia, "it was then a serious
matter with you. Comfort yourself therefore with thinking, that
whatever you now lament may hereafter appear as trifling and
contemptible as a ball would at this time."

"Alas, my Sophia," replied the other lady, "you yourself will think
otherwise of my present situation; for greatly must that tender heart
be altered if my misfortunes do not draw many a sigh, nay, many a
tear, from you. The knowledge of this should perhaps deter me from
relating what I am convinced will so much affect you." Here Mrs
Fitzpatrick stopt, till, at the repeated entreaties of Sophia, she
thus proceeded:

"Though you must have heard much of my marriage; yet, as matters may
probably have been misrepresented, I will set out from the very
commencement of my unfortunate acquaintance with my present husband;
which was at Bath, soon after you left my aunt, and returned home to
your father.

"Among the gay young fellows who were at this season at Bath, Mr
Fitzpatrick was one. He was handsome, _dégagé,_ extremely gallant, and
in his dress exceeded most others. In short, my dear, if you was
unluckily to see him now, I could describe him no better than by
telling you he was the very reverse of everything which he is: for he
hath rusticated himself so long, that he is become an absolute wild
Irishman. But to proceed in my story: the qualifications which he then
possessed so well recommended him, that, though the people of quality
at that time lived separate from the rest of the company, and excluded
them from all their parties, Mr Fitzpatrick found means to gain
admittance. It was perhaps no easy matter to avoid him; for he
required very little or no invitation; and as, being handsome and
genteel, he found it no very difficult matter to ingratiate himself
with the ladies, so, he having frequently drawn his sword, the men did
not care publickly to affront him. Had it not been for some such
reason, I believe he would have been soon expelled by his own sex; for
surely he had no strict title to be preferred to the English gentry;
nor did they seem inclined to show him any extraordinary favour. They
all abused him behind his back, which might probably proceed from
envy; for by the women he was well received, and very particularly
distinguished by them.

"My aunt, though no person of quality herself, as she had always lived
about the court, was enrolled in that party; for, by whatever means
you get into the polite circle, when you are once there, it is
sufficient merit for you that you are there. This observation, young
as you was, you could scarce avoid making from my aunt, who was free,
or reserved, with all people, just as they had more or less of this
merit.

"And this merit, I believe, it was, which principally recommended Mr
Fitzpatrick to her favour. In which he so well succeeded, that he was
always one of her private parties. Nor was he backward in returning
such distinction; for he soon grew so very particular in his behaviour
to her, that the scandal club first began to take notice of it, and
the better-disposed persons made a match between them. For my own
part, I confess, I made no doubt but that his designs were strictly
honourable, as the phrase is; that is, to rob a lady of her fortune by
way of marriage. My aunt was, I conceived, neither young enough nor
handsome enough to attract much wicked inclination; but she had
matrimonial charms in great abundance.

"I was the more confirmed in this opinion from the extraordinary
respect which he showed to myself from the first moment of our
acquaintance. This I understood as an attempt to lessen, if possible,
that disinclination which my interest might be supposed to give me
towards the match; and I know not but in some measure it had that
effect; for, as I was well contented with my own fortune, and of all
people the least a slave to interested views, so I could not be
violently the enemy of a man with whose behaviour to me I was greatly
pleased; and the more so, as I was the only object of such respect;
for he behaved at the same time to many women of quality without any
respect at all.

"Agreeable as this was to me, he soon changed it into another kind of
behaviour, which was perhaps more so. He now put on much softness and
tenderness, and languished and sighed abundantly. At times, indeed,
whether from art or nature I will not determine, he gave his usual
loose to gaiety and mirth; but this was always in general company, and
with other women; for even in a country-dance, when he was not my
partner, he became grave, and put on the softest look imaginable the
moment he approached me. Indeed he was in all things so very
particular towards me, that I must have been blind not to have
discovered it. And, and, and----" "And you was more pleased still, my
dear Harriet," cries Sophia; "you need not be ashamed," added she,
sighing; "for sure there are irresistible charms in tenderness, which
too many men are able to affect." "True," answered her cousin; "men,
who in all other instances want common sense, are very Machiavels in
the art of loving. I wish I did not know an instance.--Well, scandal
now began to be as busy with me as it had before been with my aunt;
and some good ladies did not scruple to affirm that Mr Fitzpatrick had
an intrigue with us both.

"But, what may seem astonishing, my aunt never saw, nor in the least
seemed to suspect, that which was visible enough, I believe, from both
our behaviours. One would indeed think that love quite puts out the
eyes of an old woman. In fact, they so greedily swallow the addresses
which are made to them, that, like an outrageous glutton, they are not
at leisure to observe what passes amongst others at the same table.
This I have observed in more cases than my own; and this was so
strongly verified by my aunt, that, though she often found us together
at her return from the pump, the least canting word of his, pretending
impatience at her absence, effectually smothered all suspicion. One
artifice succeeded with her to admiration. This was his treating me
like a little child, and never calling me by any other name in her
presence but that of pretty miss. This indeed did him some disservice
with your humble servant; but I soon saw through it, especially as in
her absence he behaved to me, as I have said, in a different manner.
However, if I was not greatly disobliged by a conduct of which I had
discovered the design, I smarted very severely for it; for my aunt
really conceived me to be what her lover (as she thought him) called
me, and treated me in all respects as a perfect infant. To say the
truth, I wonder she had not insisted on my again wearing
leading-strings.

"At last, my lover (for so he was) thought proper, in a most solemn
manner, to disclose a secret which I had known long before. He now
placed all the love which he had pretended to my aunt to my account.
He lamented, in very pathetic terms, the encouragement she had given
him, and made a high merit of the tedious hours in which he had
undergone her conversation.--What shall I tell you, my dear
Sophia?--Then I will confess the truth. I was pleased with my man. I
was pleased with my conquest. To rival my aunt delighted me; to rival
so many other women charmed me. In short, I am afraid I did not behave
as I should do, even upon the very first declaration--I wish I did not
almost give him positive encouragement before we parted.

"The Bath now talked loudly--I might almost say, roared against me.
Several young women affected to shun my acquaintance, not so much,
perhaps, from any real suspicion, as from a desire of banishing me
from a company in which I too much engrossed their favourite man. And
here I cannot omit expressing my gratitude to the kindness intended me
by Mr Nash, who took me one day aside, and gave me advice, which if I
had followed, I had been a happy woman. `Child,' says he, `I am sorry
to see the familiarity which subsists between you and a fellow who is
altogether unworthy of you, and I am afraid will prove your ruin. As
for your old stinking aunt, if it was to be no injury to you and my
pretty Sophy Western (I assure you I repeat his words), I should be
heartily glad that the fellow was in possession of all that belongs to
her. I never advise old women: for, if they take it into their heads
to go to the devil, it is no more possible than worth while to keep
them from him. Innocence and youth and beauty are worthy a better
fate, and I would save them from his clutches. Let me advise you
therefore, dear child, never suffer this fellow to be particular with
you again.' Many more things he said to me, which I have now
forgotten, and indeed I attended very little to them at the time; for
inclination contradicted all he said; and, besides, I could not be
persuaded that women of quality would condescend to familiarity with
such a person as he described.

"But I am afraid, my dear, I shall tire you with a detail of so many
minute circumstances. To be concise, therefore, imagine me married;
imagine me with my husband, at the feet of my aunt; and then imagine
the maddest woman in Bedlam, in a raving fit, and your imagination
will suggest to you no more than what really happened.

"The very next day my aunt left the place, partly to avoid seeing Mr
Fitzpatrick or myself, and as much perhaps to avoid seeing any one
else; for, though I am told she hath since denied everything stoutly,
I believe she was then a little confounded at her disappointment.
Since that time, I have written to her many letters, but never could
obtain an answer, which I must own sits somewhat the heavier, as she
herself was, though undesignedly, the occasion of all my sufferings:
for, had it not been under the colour of paying his addresses to her,
Mr Fitzpatrick would never have found sufficient opportunities to have
engaged my heart, which, in other circumstances, I still flatter
myself would not have been an easy conquest to such a person. Indeed,
I believe I should not have erred so grossly in my choice if I had
relied on my own judgment; but I trusted totally to the opinion of
others, and very foolishly took the merit of a man for granted whom I
saw so universally well received by the women. What is the reason, my
dear, that we, who have understandings equal to the wisest and
greatest of the other sex, so often make choice of the silliest
fellows for companions and favourites? It raises my indignation to the
highest pitch to reflect on the numbers of women of sense who have
been undone by fools." Here she paused a moment; but, Sophia making no
answer, she proceeded as in the next chapter.



Chapter v.

In which the history of Mrs Fitzpatrick is continued.


"We remained at Bath no longer than a fortnight after our wedding; for
as to any reconciliation with my aunt, there were no hopes; and of my
fortune not one farthing could be touched till I was of age, of which
I now wanted more than two years. My husband therefore was resolved to
set out for Ireland; against which I remonstrated very earnestly, and
insisted on a promise which he had made me before our marriage that I
should never take this journey against my consent; and indeed I never
intended to consent to it; nor will anybody, I believe, blame me for
that resolution; but this, however, I never mentioned to my husband,
and petitioned only for the reprieve of a month; but he had fixed the
day, and to that day he obstinately adhered.

"The evening before our departure, as we were disputing this point
with great eagerness on both sides, he started suddenly from his
chair, and left me abruptly, saying he was going to the rooms. He was
hardly out of the house when I saw a paper lying on the floor, which,
I suppose, he had carelessly pulled from his pocket, together with his
handkerchief. This paper I took up, and, finding it to be a letter, I
made no scruple to open and read it; and indeed I read it so often
that I can repeat it to you almost word for word. This then was the
letter:

  _'To Mr Brian Fitzpatrick._

  'SIR,

  'YOURS received, and am surprized you should use me in this manner,
  as have never seen any of your cash, unless for one linsey-woolsey
  coat, and your bill now is upwards of £150. Consider, sir, how often
  you have fobbed me off with your being shortly to be married to this
  lady and t'other lady; but I can neither live on hopes or promises,
  nor will my woollen-draper take any such in payment. You tell me you
  are secure of having either the aunt or the niece, and that you
  might have married the aunt before this, whose jointure you say is
  immense, but that you prefer the niece on account of her ready
  money. Pray, sir, take a fool's advice for once, and marry the first
  you can get. You will pardon my offering my advice, as you know I
  sincerely wish you well. Shall draw on you per next post, in favour
  of Messieurs John Drugget and company, at fourteen days, which doubt
  not your honouring, and am,

  Sir, your humble servant, 'SAM. COSGRAVE.'

"This was the letter, word for word. Guess, my dear girl--guess how
this letter affected me. You prefer the niece on account of her ready
money! If every one of these words had been a dagger, I could with
pleasure have stabbed them into his heart; but I will not recount my
frantic behaviour on the occasion. I had pretty well spent my tears
before his return home; but sufficient remains of them appeared in my
swollen eyes. He threw himself sullenly into his chair, and for a long
time we were both silent. At length, in a haughty tone, he said, `I
hope, madam, your servants have packed up all your things; for the
coach will be ready by six in the morning.' My patience was totally
subdued by this provocation, and I answered, `No, sir, there is a
letter still remains unpacked;' and then throwing it on the table I
fell to upbraiding him with the most bitter language I could invent.

"Whether guilt, or shame, or prudence, restrained him I cannot say;
but, though he is the most passionate of men, he exerted no rage on
this occasion. He endeavoured, on the contrary, to pacify me by the
most gentle means. He swore the phrase in the letter to which I
principally objected was not his, nor had he ever written any such. He
owned, indeed, the having mentioned his marriage, and that preference
which he had given to myself, but denied with many oaths the having
mentioned any such matter at all on account of the straits he was in
for money, arising, he said, from his having too long neglected his
estate in Ireland. And this, he said, which he could not bear to
discover to me, was the only reason of his having so strenuously
insisted on our journey. He then used several very endearing
expressions, and concluded by a very fond caress, and many violent
protestations of love.

"There was one circumstance which, though he did not appeal to it, had
much weight with me in his favour, and that was the word jointure in
the taylor's letter, whereas my aunt never had been married, and this
Mr Fitzpatrick well knew.----As I imagined, therefore, that the fellow
must have inserted this of his own head, or from hearsay, I persuaded
myself he might have ventured likewise on that odious line on no
better authority. What reasoning was this, my dear? was I not an
advocate rather than a judge?--But why do I mention such a
circumstance as this, or appeal to it for the justification of my
forgiveness?--In short, had he been guilty of twenty times as much,
half the tenderness and fondness which he used would have prevailed on
me to have forgiven him. I now made no farther objections to our
setting out, which we did the next morning, and in a little more than
a week arrived at the seat of Mr Fitzpatrick.

"Your curiosity will excuse me from relating any occurrences which
past during our journey; for it would indeed be highly disagreeable to
travel it over again, and no less so to you to travel it over with me.

"This seat, then, is an ancient mansion-house: if I was in one of
those merry humours in which you have so often seen me, I could
describe it to you ridiculously enough. It looked as if it had been
formerly inhabited by a gentleman. Here was room enough, and not the
less room on account of the furniture; for indeed there was very
little in it. An old woman, who seemed coeval with the building, and
greatly resembled her whom Chamont mentions in the Orphan, received us
at the gate, and in a howl scarce human, and to me unintelligible,
welcomed her master home. In short, the whole scene was so gloomy and
melancholy, that it threw my spirits into the lowest dejection; which
my husband discerning, instead of relieving, encreased by two or three
malicious observations. `There are good houses, madam,' says he, `as
you find, in other places besides England; but perhaps you had rather
be in a dirty lodgings at Bath.'

"Happy, my dear, is the woman who, in any state of life, hath a
cheerful good-natured companion to support and comfort her! But why do
I reflect on happy situations only to aggravate my own misery? my
companion, far from clearing up the gloom of solitude, soon convinced
me that I must have been wretched with him in any place, and in any
condition. In a word, he was a surly fellow, a character perhaps you
have never seen; for, indeed, no woman ever sees it exemplified but in
a father, a brother, or a husband; and, though you have a father, he
is not of that character. This surly fellow had formerly appeared to
me the very reverse, and so he did still to every other person. Good
heaven! how is it possible for a man to maintain a constant lie in his
appearance abroad and in company, and to content himself with shewing
disagreeable truth only at home? Here, my dear, they make themselves
amends for the uneasy restraint which they put on their tempers in the
world; for I have observed, the more merry and gay and good-humoured
my husband hath at any time been in company, the more sullen and
morose he was sure to become at our next private meeting. How shall I
describe his barbarity? To my fondness he was cold and insensible. My
little comical ways, which you, my Sophy, and which others, have
called so agreeable, he treated with contempt. In my most serious
moments he sung and whistled; and whenever I was thoroughly dejected
and miserable he was angry, and abused me: for, though he was never
pleased with my good-humour, nor ascribed it to my satisfaction in
him, yet my low spirits always offended him, and those he imputed to
my repentance of having (as he said) married an Irishman.

"You will easily conceive, my dear Graveairs (I ask your pardon, I
really forgot myself), that, when a woman makes an imprudent match in
the sense of the world, that is, when she is not an arrant prostitute
to pecuniary interest, she must necessarily have some inclination and
affection for her man. You will as easily believe that this affection
may possibly be lessened; nay, I do assure you, contempt will wholly
eradicate it. This contempt I now began to entertain for my husband,
whom I now discovered to be--I must use the expression--an arrant
blockhead. Perhaps you will wonder I did not make this discovery long
before; but women will suggest a thousand excuses to themselves for
the folly of those they like: besides, give me leave to tell you, it
requires a most penetrating eye to discern a fool through the
disguises of gaiety and good breeding.

"It will be easily imagined that, when I once despised my husband, as
I confess to you I soon did, I must consequently dislike his company;
and indeed I had the happiness of being very little troubled with it;
for our house was now most elegantly furnished, our cellars well
stocked, and dogs and horses provided in great abundance. As my
gentleman therefore entertained his neighbours with great hospitality,
so his neighbours resorted to him with great alacrity; and sports and
drinking consumed so much of his time, that a small part of his
conversation, that is to say, of his ill-humours, fell to my share.

"Happy would it have been for me if I could as easily have avoided all
other disagreeable company; but, alas! I was confined to some which
constantly tormented me; and the more, as I saw no prospect of being
relieved from them. These companions were my own racking thoughts,
which plagued and in a manner haunted me night and day. In this
situation I past through a scene, the horrors of which can neither be
painted nor imagined. Think, my dear, figure, if you can, to yourself,
what I must have undergone. I became a mother by the man I scorned,
hated, and detested. I went through all the agonies and miseries of a
lying-in (ten times more painful in such a circumstance than the worst
labour can be when one endures it for a man one loves) in a desert, or
rather, indeed, a scene of riot and revel, without a friend, without a
companion, or without any of those agreeable circumstances which often
alleviate, and perhaps sometimes more than compensate, the sufferings
of our sex at that season."



Chapter vi.

In which the mistake of the landlord throws Sophia into a dreadful
consternation.


Mrs Fitzpatrick was proceeding in her narrative when she was
interrupted by the entrance of dinner, greatly to the concern of
Sophia; for the misfortunes of her friend had raised her anxiety, and
left her no appetite but what Mrs Fitzpatrick was to satisfy by her
relation.

The landlord now attended with a plate under his arm, and with the
same respect in his countenance and address which he would have put on
had the ladies arrived in a coach and six.

The married lady seemed less affected with her own misfortunes than
was her cousin; for the former eat very heartily, whereas the latter
could hardly swallow a morsel. Sophia likewise showed more concern and
sorrow in her countenance than appeared in the other lady; who, having
observed these symptoms in her friend, begged her to be comforted,
saying, "Perhaps all may yet end better than either you or I expect."

Our landlord thought he had now an opportunity to open his mouth, and
was resolved not to omit it. "I am sorry, madam," cries he, "that your
ladyship can't eat; for to be sure you must be hungry after so long
fasting. I hope your ladyship is not uneasy at anything, for, as madam
there says, all may end better than anybody expects. A gentleman who
was here just now brought excellent news; and perhaps some folks who
have given other folks the slip may get to London before they are
overtaken; and if they do, I make no doubt but they will find people
who will be very ready to receive them."

All persons under the apprehension of danger convert whatever they see
and hear into the objects of that apprehension. Sophia therefore
immediately concluded, from the foregoing speech, that she was known,
and pursued by her father. She was now struck with the utmost
consternation, and for a few minutes deprived of the power of speech;
which she no sooner recovered than she desired the landlord to send
his servants out of the room, and then, addressing herself to him,
said, "I perceive, sir, you know who we are; but I beseech you--nay, I
am convinced, if you have any compassion or goodness, you will not
betray us."

"I betray your ladyship!" quoth the landlord; "no (and then he swore
several very hearty oaths); I would sooner be cut into ten thousand
pieces. I hate all treachery. I! I never betrayed any one in my life
yet, and I am sure I shall not begin with so sweet a lady as your
ladyship. All the world would very much blame me if I should, since it
will be in your ladyship's power so shortly to reward me. My wife can
witness for me, I knew your ladyship the moment you came into the
house: I said it was your honour, before I lifted you from your horse,
and I shall carry the bruises I got in your ladyship's service to the
grave; but what signified that, as long as I saved your ladyship? To
be sure some people this morning would have thought of getting a
reward; but no such thought ever entered into my head. I would sooner
starve than take any reward for betraying your ladyship."

"I promise you, sir," says Sophia, "if it be ever in my power to
reward you, you shall not lose by your generosity."

"Alack-a-day, madam!" answered the landlord; "in your ladyship's
power! Heaven put it as much into your will! I am only afraid your
honour will forget such a poor man as an innkeeper; but, if your
ladyship should not, I hope you will remember what reward I
refused--refused! that is, I would have refused, and to be sure it may
be called refusing, for I might have had it certainly; and to be sure
you might have been in some houses;--but, for my part, would not
methinks for the world have your ladyship wrong me so much as to
imagine I ever thought of betraying you, even before I heard the good
news."

"What news, pray?" says Sophia, something eagerly.

"Hath not your ladyship heard it, then?" cries the landlord; "nay,
like enough, for I heard it only a few minutes ago; and if I had never
heard it, may the devil fly away with me this instant if I would have
betrayed your honour! no, if I would, may I--" Here he subjoined
several dreadful imprecations, which Sophia at last interrupted, and
begged to know what he meant by the news.--He was going to answer,
when Mrs Honour came running into the room, all pale and breathless,
and cried out, "Madam, we are all undone, all ruined, they are come,
they are come!" These words almost froze up the blood of Sophia; but
Mrs Fitzpatrick asked Honour who were come?--"Who?" answered she,
"why, the French; several hundred thousands of them are landed, and we
shall be all murdered and ravished."

As a miser, who hath, in some well-built city, a cottage, value twenty
shillings, when at a distance he is alarmed with the news of a fire,
turns pale and trembles at his loss; but when he finds the beautiful
palaces only are burnt, and his own cottage remains safe, he comes
instantly to himself, and smiles at his good fortunes: or as (for we
dislike something in the former simile) the tender mother, when
terrified with the apprehension that her darling boy is drowned, is
struck senseless and almost dead with consternation; but when she is
told that little master is safe, and the Victory only, with twelve
hundred brave men, gone to the bottom, life and sense again return,
maternal fondness enjoys the sudden relief from all its fears, and the
general benevolence which at another time would have deeply felt the
dreadful catastrophe, lies fast asleep in her mind;--so Sophia, than
whom none was more capable of tenderly feeling the general calamity of
her country, found such immediate satisfaction from the relief of
those terrors she had of being overtaken by her father, that the
arrival of the French scarce made any impression on her. She gently
chid her maid for the fright into which she had thrown her, and said
"she was glad it was no worse; for that she had feared somebody else
was come."

"Ay, ay," quoth the landlord, smiling, "her ladyship knows better
things; she knows the French are our very best friends, and come over
hither only for our good. They are the people who are to make Old
England flourish again. I warrant her honour thought the duke was
coming; and that was enough to put her into a fright. I was going to
tell your ladyship the news.--His honour's majesty, Heaven bless him,
hath given the duke the slip, and is marching as fast as he can to
London, and ten thousand French are landed to join him on the road."

Sophia was not greatly pleased with this news, nor with the gentleman
who related it; but, as she still imagined he knew her (for she could
not possibly have any suspicion of the real truth), she durst not show
any dislike. And now the landlord, having removed the cloth from the
table, withdrew; but at his departure frequently repeated his hopes of
being remembered hereafter.

The mind of Sophia was not at all easy under the supposition of being
known at this house; for she still applied to herself many things
which the landlord had addressed to Jenny Cameron; she therefore
ordered her maid to pump out of him by what means he had become
acquainted with her person, and who had offered him the reward for
betraying her; she likewise ordered the horses to be in readiness by
four in the morning, at which hour Mrs Fitzpatrick promised to bear
her company; and then, composing herself as well as she could, she
desired that lady to continue her story.



Chapter vii.

In which Mrs Fitzpatrick concludes her history.


While Mrs Honour, in pursuance of the commands of her mistress,
ordered a bowl of punch, and invited my landlord and landlady to
partake of it, Mrs Fitzpatrick thus went on with her relation.

"Most of the officers who were quartered at a town in our
neighbourhood were of my husband's acquaintance. Among these there was
a lieutenant, a very pretty sort of man, and who was married to a
woman, so agreeable both in her temper and conversation, that from our
first knowing each other, which was soon after my lying-in, we were
almost inseparable companions; for I had the good fortune to make
myself equally agreeable to her.

"The lieutenant, who was neither a sot nor a sportsman, was frequently
of our parties; indeed he was very little with my husband, and no more
than good breeding constrained him to be, as he lived almost
constantly at our house. My husband often expressed much
dissatisfaction at the lieutenant's preferring my company to his; he
was very angry with me on that account, and gave me many a hearty
curse for drawing away his companions; saying, `I ought to be d--n'd
for having spoiled one of the prettiest fellows in the world, by
making a milksop of him.'

"You will be mistaken, my dear Sophia, if you imagine that the anger
of my husband arose from my depriving him of a companion; for the
lieutenant was not a person with whose society a fool could be
pleased; and, if I should admit the possibility of this, so little
right had my husband to place the loss of his companion to me, that I
am convinced it was my conversation alone which induced him ever to
come to the house. No, child, it was envy, the worst and most
rancorous kind of envy, the envy of superiority of understanding. The
wretch could not bear to see my conversation preferred to his, by a
man of whom he could not entertain the least jealousy. O my dear
Sophy, you are a woman of sense; if you marry a man, as is most
probable you will, of less capacity than yourself, make frequent
trials of his temper before marriage, and see whether he can bear to
submit to such a superiority.--Promise me, Sophy, you will take this
advice; for you will hereafter find its importance." "It is very
likely I shall never marry at all," answered Sophia; "I think, at
least, I shall never marry a man in whose understanding I see any
defects before marriage; and I promise you I would rather give up my
own than see any such afterwards." "Give up your understanding!"
replied Mrs Fitzpatrick; "oh, fie, child! I will not believe so meanly
of you. Everything else I might myself be brought to give up; but
never this. Nature would not have allotted this superiority to the
wife in so many instances, if she had intended we should all of us
have surrendered it to the husband. This, indeed, men of sense never
expect of us; of which the lieutenant I have just mentioned was one
notable example; for though he had a very good understanding, he
always acknowledged (as was really true) that his wife had a better.
And this, perhaps, was one reason of the hatred my tyrant bore her.

"Before he would be so governed by a wife, he said, especially such an
ugly b-- (for, indeed, she was not a regular beauty, but very
agreeable and extremely genteel), he would see all the women upon
earth at the devil, which was a very usual phrase with him. He said,
he wondered what I could see in her to be so charmed with her company:
since this woman, says he, hath come among us, there is an end of your
beloved reading, which you pretended to like so much, that you could
not afford time to return the visits of the ladies in this country;
and I must confess I had been guilty of a little rudeness this way;
for the ladies there are at least no better than the mere country
ladies here; and I think I need make no other excuse to you for
declining any intimacy with them.

"This correspondence, however, continued a whole year, even all the
while the lieutenant was quartered in that town; for which I was
contented to pay the tax of being constantly abused in the manner
above mentioned by my husband; I mean when he was at home; for he was
frequently absent a month at a time at Dublin, and once made a journey
of two months to London: in all which journeys I thought it a very
singular happiness that he never once desired my company; nay, by his
frequent censures on men who could not travel, as he phrased it,
without a wife tied up to their tail, he sufficiently intimated that,
had I been never so desirous of accompanying him, my wishes would have
been in vain; but, Heaven knows, such wishes were very far from my
thoughts.

"At length my friend was removed from me, and I was again left to my
solitude, to the tormenting conversation with my own reflections, and
to apply to books for my only comfort. I now read almost all day long.
How many books do you think I read in three months?" "I can't guess,
indeed, cousin," answered Sophia. "Perhaps half a score." "Half a
score! half a thousand, child!" answered the other. "I read a good
deal in Daniel's English History of France; a great deal in Plutarch's
Lives, the Atalantis, Pope's Homer, Dryden's Plays, Chillingworth, the
Countess D'Aulnois, and Locke's Human Understanding.

"During this interval I wrote three very supplicating, and, I thought,
moving letters to my aunt; but, as I received no answer to any of
them, my disdain would not suffer me to continue my application." Here
she stopt, and, looking earnestly at Sophia, said, "Methinks, my dear,
I read something in your eyes which reproaches me of a neglect in
another place, where I should have met with a kinder return." "Indeed,
dear Harriet," answered Sophia, "your story is an apology for any
neglect; but, indeed, I feel that I have been guilty of a remissness,
without so good an excuse.--Yet pray proceed; for I long, though I
tremble, to hear the end."

Thus, then, Mrs Fitzpatrick resumed her narrative:--"My husband now
took a second journey to England, where he continued upwards of three
months; during the greater part of this time I led a life which
nothing but having led a worse could make me think tolerable; for
perfect solitude can never be reconciled to a social mind, like mine,
but when it relieves you from the company of those you hate. What
added to my wretchedness was the loss of my little infant: not that I
pretend to have had for it that extravagant tenderness of which I
believe I might have been capable under other circumstances; but I
resolved, in every instance, to discharge the duty of the tenderest
mother; and this care prevented me from feeling the weight of that
heaviest of all things, when it can be at all said to lie heavy on our
hands.

"I had spent full ten weeks almost entirely by myself, having seen
nobody all that time, except my servants and a very few visitors, when
a young lady, a relation to my husband, came from a distant part of
Ireland to visit me. She had staid once before a week at my house, and
then I gave her a pressing invitation to return; for she was a very
agreeable woman, and had improved good natural parts by a proper
education. Indeed, she was to me a welcome guest.

"A few days after her arrival, perceiving me in very low spirits,
without enquiring the cause, which, indeed, she very well knew, the
young lady fell to compassionating my case. She said, `Though
politeness had prevented me from complaining to my husband's relations
of his behaviour, yet they all were very sensible of it, and felt
great concern upon that account; but none more than herself.' And
after some more general discourse on this head, which I own I could
not forbear countenancing, at last, after much previous precaution and
enjoined concealment, she communicated to me, as a profound
secret--that my husband kept a mistress.

"You will certainly imagine I heard this news with the utmost
insensibility--Upon my word, if you do, your imagination will mislead
you. Contempt had not so kept down my anger to my husband, but that
hatred rose again on this occasion. What can be the reason of this?
Are we so abominably selfish, that we can be concerned at others
having possession even of what we despise? Or are we not rather
abominably vain, and is not this the greatest injury done to our
vanity? What think you, Sophia?"

"I don't know, indeed," answered Sophia; "I have never troubled myself
with any of these deep contemplations; but I think the lady did very
ill in communicating to you such a secret."

"And yet, my dear, this conduct is natural," replied Mrs Fitzpatrick;
"and, when you have seen and read as much as myself, you will
acknowledge it to be so."

"I am sorry to hear it is natural," returned Sophia; "for I want
neither reading nor experience to convince me that it is very
dishonourable and very ill-natured: nay, it is surely as ill-bred to
tell a husband or wife of the faults of each other as to tell them of
their own."

"Well," continued Mrs Fitzpatrick, "my husband at last returned; and,
if I am thoroughly acquainted with my own thoughts, I hated him now
more than ever; but I despised him rather less: for certainly nothing
so much weakens our contempt, as an injury done to our pride or our
vanity.

"He now assumed a carriage to me so very different from what he had
lately worn, and so nearly resembling his behaviour the first week of
our marriage, that, had I now had any spark of love remaining, he
might, possibly, have rekindled my fondness for him. But, though
hatred may succeed to contempt, and may perhaps get the better of it,
love, I believe, cannot. The truth is, the passion of love is too
restless to remain contented without the gratification which it
receives from its object; and one can no more be inclined to love
without loving than we can have eyes without seeing. When a husband,
therefore, ceases to be the object of this passion, it is most
probable some other man--I say, my dear, if your husband grows
indifferent to you--if you once come to despise him--I say--that
is--if you have the passion of love in you--Lud! I have bewildered
myself so--but one is apt, in these abstracted considerations, to lose
the concatenation of ideas, as Mr Locke says:--in short, the truth
is--in short, I scarce know what it is; but, as I was saying, my
husband returned, and his behaviour, at first, greatly surprized me;
but he soon acquainted me with the motive, and taught me to account
for it. In a word, then, he had spent and lost all the ready money of
my fortune; and, as he could mortgage his own estate no deeper, he was
now desirous to supply himself with cash for his extravagance, by
selling a little estate of mine, which he could not do without my
assistance; and to obtain this favour was the whole and sole motive of
all the fondness which he now put on.

"With this I peremptorily refused to comply. I told him, and I told
him truly, that, had I been possessed of the Indies at our first
marriage, he might have commanded it all; for it had been a constant
maxim with me, that where a woman disposes of her heart, she should
always deposit her fortune; but, as he had been so kind, long ago, to
restore the former into my possession, I was resolved likewise to
retain what little remained of the latter.

"I will not describe to you the passion into which these words, and
the resolute air in which they were spoken, threw him: nor will I
trouble you with the whole scene which succeeded between us. Out came,
you may be well assured, the story of the mistress; and out it did
come, with all the embellishments which anger and disdain could bestow
upon it.

"Mr Fitzpatrick seemed a little thunderstruck with this, and more
confused than I had seen him, though his ideas are always confused
enough, heaven knows. He did not, however, endeavour to exculpate
himself; but took a method which almost equally confounded me. What
was this but recrimination? He affected to be jealous:--he may, for
aught I know, be inclined enough to jealousy in his natural temper;
nay, he must have had it from nature, or the devil must have put it
into his head; for I defy all the world to cast a just aspersion on my
character: nay, the most scandalous tongues have never dared censure
my reputation. My fame, I thank heaven, hath been always as spotless
as my life; and let falsehood itself accuse that if it dare. No, my
dear Graveairs, however provoked, however ill-treated, however injured
in my love, I have firmly resolved never to give the least room for
censure on this account.--And yet, my dear, there are some people so
malicious, some tongues so venomous, that no innocence can escape
them. The most undesigned word, the most accidental look, the least
familiarity, the most innocent freedom, will be misconstrued, and
magnified into I know not what, by some people. But I despise, my dear
Graveairs, I despise all such slander. No such malice, I assure you,
ever gave me an uneasy moment. No, no, I promise you I am above all
that.--But where was I? O let me see, I told you my husband was
jealous--And of whom, I pray?--Why, of whom but the lieutenant I
mentioned to you before! He was obliged to resort above a year and
more back to find any object for this unaccountable passion, if,
indeed, he really felt any such, and was not an arrant counterfeit in
order to abuse me.

"But I have tired you already with too many particulars. I will now
bring my story to a very speedy conclusion. In short, then, after many
scenes very unworthy to be repeated, in which my cousin engaged so
heartily on my side, that Mr Fitzpatrick at last turned her out of
doors; when he found I was neither to be soothed nor bullied into
compliance, he took a very violent method indeed. Perhaps you will
conclude he beat me; but this, though he hath approached very near to
it, he never actually did. He confined me to my room, without
suffering me to have either pen, ink, paper, or book: and a servant
every day made my bed, and brought me my food.

"When I had remained a week under this imprisonment, he made me a
visit, and, with the voice of a schoolmaster, or, what is often much
the same, of a tyrant, asked me, `If I would yet comply?' I answered,
very stoutly, `That I would die first.' `Then so you shall, and be
d--nd!' cries he; `for you shall never go alive out of this room.'

"Here I remained a fortnight longer; and, to say the truth, my
constancy was almost subdued, and I began to think of submission;
when, one day, in the absence of my husband, who was gone abroad for
some short time, by the greatest good fortune in the world, an
accident happened.--I--at a time when I began to give way to the
utmost despair----everything would be excusable at such a time--at
that very time I received----But it would take up an hour to tell you
all particulars.--In one word, then (for I will not tire you with
circumstances), gold, the common key to all padlocks, opened my door,
and set me at liberty.

"I now made haste to Dublin, where I immediately procured a passage to
England; and was proceeding to Bath, in order to throw myself into the
protection of my aunt, or of your father, or of any relation who would
afford it me. My husband overtook me last night at the inn where I
lay, and which you left a few minutes before me; but I had the good
luck to escape him, and to follow you.

"And thus, my dear, ends my history: a tragical one, I am sure, it is
to myself; but, perhaps, I ought rather to apologize to you for its
dullness."

Sophia heaved a deep sigh, and answered, "Indeed, Harriet, I pity you
from my soul!----But what could you expect? Why, why, would you marry
an Irishman?"

"Upon my word," replied her cousin, "your censure is unjust. There
are, among the Irish, men of as much worth and honour as any among the
English: nay, to speak the truth, generosity of spirit is rather more
common among them. I have known some examples there, too, of good
husbands; and I believe these are not very plenty in England. Ask me,
rather, what I could expect when I married a fool; and I will tell you
a solemn truth; I did not know him to be so."--"Can no man," said
Sophia, in a very low and altered voice, "do you think, make a bad
husband, who is not a fool?" "That," answered the other, "is too
general a negative; but none, I believe, is so likely as a fool to
prove so. Among my acquaintance, the silliest fellows are the worst
husbands; and I will venture to assert, as a fact, that a man of sense
rarely behaves very ill to a wife who deserves very well."



Chapter viii.

A dreadful alarm in the inn, with the arrival of an unexpected friend
of Mrs Fitzpatrick.


Sophia now, at the desire of her cousin, related--not what follows,
but what hath gone before in this history: for which reason the reader
will, I suppose, excuse me for not repeating it over again.

One remark, however, I cannot forbear making on her narrative, namely,
that she made no more mention of Jones, from the beginning to the end,
than if there had been no such person alive. This I will neither
endeavour to account for nor to excuse. Indeed, if this may be called
a kind of dishonesty, it seems the more inexcusable, from the apparent
openness and explicit sincerity of the other lady.--But so it was.

Just as Sophia arrived at the conclusion of her story, there arrived
in the room where the two ladies were sitting a noise, not unlike, in
loudness, to that of a pack of hounds just let out from their kennel;
nor, in shrillness, to cats, when caterwauling; or to screech owls;
or, indeed, more like (for what animal can resemble a human voice?) to
those sounds which, in the pleasant mansions of that gate which seems
to derive its name from a duplicity of tongues, issue from the mouths,
and sometimes from the nostrils, of those fair river nymphs, ycleped
of old the Naïades; in the vulgar tongue translated oyster-wenches;
for when, instead of the antient libations of milk and honey and oil,
the rich distillation from the juniper-berry, or, perhaps, from malt,
hath, by the early devotion of their votaries, been poured forth in
great abundance, should any daring tongue with unhallowed license
prophane, _i.e._, depreciate, the delicate fat Milton oyster, the
plaice sound and firm, the flounder as much alive as when in the
water, the shrimp as big as a prawn, the fine cod alive but a few
hours ago, or any other of the various treasures which those
water-deities who fish the sea and rivers have committed to the care
of the nymphs, the angry Naïades lift up their immortal voices, and
the prophane wretch is struck deaf for his impiety.

Such was the noise which now burst from one of the rooms below; and
soon the thunder, which long had rattled at a distance, began to
approach nearer and nearer, till, having ascended by degrees upstairs,
it at last entered the apartment where the ladies were. In short, to
drop all metaphor and figure, Mrs Honour, having scolded violently
below-stairs, and continued the same all the way up, came in to her
mistress in a most outrageous passion, crying out, "What doth your
ladyship think? Would you imagine that this impudent villain, the
master of this house, hath had the impudence to tell me, nay, to stand
it out to my face, that your ladyship is that nasty, stinking wh--re
(Jenny Cameron they call her), that runs about the country with the
Pretender? Nay, the lying, saucy villain had the assurance to tell me
that your ladyship had owned yourself to be so; but I have clawed the
rascal; I have left the marks of my nails in his impudent face. My
lady! says I, you saucy scoundrel; my lady is meat for no pretenders.
She is a young lady of as good fashion, and family, and fortune, as
any in Somersetshire. Did you never hear of the great Squire Western,
sirrah? She is his only daughter; she is----, and heiress to all his
great estate. My lady to be called a nasty Scotch wh--re by such a
varlet!--To be sure I wish I had knocked his brains out with the
punch-bowl."

The principal uneasiness with which Sophia was affected on this
occasion Honour had herself caused, by having in her passion
discovered who she was. However, as this mistake of the landlord
sufficiently accounted for those passages which Sophia had before
mistaken, she acquired some ease on that account; nor could she, upon
the whole, forbear smiling. This enraged Honour, and she cried,
"Indeed, madam, I did not think your ladyship would have made a
laughing matter of it. To be called whore by such an impudent low
rascal. Your ladyship may be angry with me, for aught I know, for
taking your part, since proffered service, they say, stinks; but to be
sure I could never bear to hear a lady of mine called whore.--Nor will
I bear it. I am sure your ladyship is as virtuous a lady as ever sat
foot on English ground, and I will claw any villain's eyes out who
dares for to offer to presume for to say the least word to the
contrary. Nobody ever could say the least ill of the character of any
lady that ever I waited upon."

_Hinc illae lachrymae;_ in plain truth, Honour had as much love for
her mistress as most servants have, that is to say--But besides this,
her pride obliged her to support the character of the lady she waited
on; for she thought her own was in a very close manner connected with
it. In proportion as the character of her mistress was raised, hers
likewise, as she conceived, was raised with it; and, on the contrary,
she thought the one could not be lowered without the other.

On this subject, reader, I must stop a moment, to tell thee a story.
"The famous Nell Gwynn, stepping one day, from a house where she had
made a short visit, into her coach, saw a great mob assembled, and her
footman all bloody and dirty; the fellow, being asked by his mistress
the reason of his being in that condition, answered, `I have been
fighting, madam, with an impudent rascal who called your ladyship a
wh--re.' `You blockhead,' replied Mrs Gwynn, `at this rate you must
fight every day of your life; why, you fool, all the world knows it.'
`Do they?' cries the fellow, in a muttering voice, after he had shut
the coach-door, `they shan't call me a whore's footman for all that.'"

Thus the passion of Mrs Honour appears natural enough, even if it were
to be no otherwise accounted for; but, in reality, there was another
cause of her anger; for which we must beg leave to remind our reader
of a circumstance mentioned in the above simile. There are indeed
certain liquors, which, being applied to our passions, or to fire,
produce effects the very reverse of those produced by water, as they
serve to kindle and inflame, rather than to extinguish. Among these,
the generous liquor called punch is one. It was not, therefore,
without reason, that the learned Dr Cheney used to call drinking punch
pouring liquid fire down your throat.

Now, Mrs Honour had unluckily poured so much of this liquid fire down
her throat, that the smoke of it began to ascend into her pericranium
and blinded the eyes of Reason, which is there supposed to keep her
residence, while the fire itself from the stomach easily reached the
heart, and there inflamed the noble passion of pride. So that, upon
the whole, we shall cease to wonder at the violent rage of the
waiting-woman; though at first sight we must confess the cause seems
inadequate to the effect.

Sophia and her cousin both did all in their power to extinguish these
flames which had roared so loudly all over the house. They at length
prevailed; or, to carry the metaphor one step farther, the fire,
having consumed all the fuel which the language affords, to wit, every
reproachful term in it, at last went out of its own accord.

But, though tranquillity was restored above-stairs, it was not so
below; where my landlady, highly resenting the injury done to the
beauty of her husband by the flesh-spades of Mrs Honour, called aloud
for revenge and justice. As to the poor man, who had principally
suffered in the engagement, he was perfectly quiet. Perhaps the blood
which he lost might have cooled his anger: for the enemy had not only
applied her nails to his cheeks, but likewise her fist to his
nostrils, which lamented the blow with tears of blood in great
abundance. To this we may add reflections on his mistake; but indeed
nothing so effectually silenced his resentment as the manner in which
he now discovered his error; for as to the behaviour of Mrs Honour, it
had the more confirmed him in his opinion; but he was now assured by a
person of great figure, and who was attended by a great equipage, that
one of the ladies was a woman of fashion, and his intimate
acquaintance.

By the orders of this person, the landlord now ascended, and
acquainted our fair travellers that a great gentleman below desired to
do them the honour of waiting on them. Sophia turned pale and trembled
at this message, though the reader will conclude it was too civil,
notwithstanding the landlord's blunder, to have come from her father;
but fear hath the common fault of a justice of peace, and is apt to
conclude hastily from every slight circumstance, without examining the
evidence on both sides.

To ease the reader's curiosity, therefore, rather than his
apprehensions, we proceed to inform him that an Irish peer had arrived
very late that evening at the inn, in his way to London. This
nobleman, having sallied from his supper at the hurricane before
commemorated, had seen the attendant of Mrs Fitzpatrick, and upon a
short enquiry, was informed that her lady, with whom he was very
particularly acquainted, was above. This information he had no sooner
received than he addressed himself to the landlord, pacified him, and
sent him upstairs with compliments rather civiller than those which
were delivered.

It may perhaps be wondered at that the waiting-woman herself was not
the messenger employed on this occasion; but we are sorry to say she
was not at present qualified for that, or indeed for any other office.
The rum (for so the landlord chose to call the distillation from malt)
had basely taken the advantage of the fatigue which the poor woman had
undergone, and had made terrible depredations on her noble faculties,
at a time when they were very unable to resist the attack.

We shall not describe this tragical scene too fully; but we thought
ourselves obliged, by that historic integrity which we profess,
shortly to hint a matter which we would otherwise have been glad to
have spared. Many historians, indeed, for want of this integrity, or
of diligence, to say no worse, often leave the reader to find out
these little circumstances in the dark, and sometimes to his great
confusion and perplexity.

Sophia was very soon eased of her causeless fright by the entry of the
noble peer, who was not only an intimate acquaintance of Mrs
Fitzpatrick, but in reality a very particular friend of that lady. To
say truth, it was by his assistance that she had been enabled to
escape from her husband; for this nobleman had the same gallant
disposition with those renowned knights of whom we read in heroic
story, and had delivered many an imprisoned nymph from durance. He was
indeed as bitter an enemy to the savage authority too often exercised
by husbands and fathers, over the young and lovely of the other sex,
as ever knight-errant was to the barbarous power of enchanters; nay,
to say truth, I have often suspected that those very enchanters with
which romance everywhere abounds were in reality no other than the
husbands of those days; and matrimony itself was, perhaps, the
enchanted castle in which the nymphs were said to be confined.

This nobleman had an estate in the neighbourhood of Fitzpatrick, and
had been for some time acquainted with the lady. No sooner, therefore,
did he hear of her confinement, than he earnestly applied himself to
procure her liberty; which he presently effected, not by storming the
castle, according to the example of antient heroes, but by corrupting
the governor, in conformity with the modern art of war, in which craft
is held to be preferable to valour, and gold is found to be more
irresistible than either lead or steel.

This circumstance, however, as the lady did not think it material
enough to relate to her friend, we would not at that time impart it to
the reader. We rather chose to leave him a while under a supposition
that she had found, or coined, or by some very extraordinary, perhaps
supernatural means, had possessed herself of the money with which she
had bribed her keeper, than to interrupt her narrative by giving a
hint of what seemed to her of too little importance to be mentioned.

The peer, after a short conversation, could not forbear expressing
some surprize at meeting the lady in that place; nor could he refrain
from telling her he imagined she had been gone to Bath. Mrs
Fitzpatrick very freely answered, "That she had been prevented in her
purpose by the arrival of a person she need not mention. In short,"
says she, "I was overtaken by my husband (for I need not affect to
conceal what the world knows too well already). I had the good fortune
to escape in a most surprizing manner, and am now going to London with
this young lady, who is a near relation of mine, and who hath escaped
from as great a tyrant as my own."

His lordship, concluding that this tyrant was likewise a husband, made
a speech full of compliments to both the ladies, and as full of
invectives against his own sex; nor indeed did he avoid some oblique
glances at the matrimonial institution itself, and at the unjust
powers given by it to man over the more sensible and more meritorious
part of the species. He ended his oration with an offer of his
protection, and of his coach and six, which was instantly accepted by
Mrs Fitzpatrick, and at last, upon her persuasions, by Sophia.

Matters being thus adjusted, his lordship took his leave, and the
ladies retired to rest, where Mrs Fitzpatrick entertained her cousin
with many high encomiums on the character of the noble peer, and
enlarged very particularly on his great fondness for his wife; saying,
she believed he was almost the only person of high rank who was
entirely constant to the marriage bed. "Indeed," added she, "my dear
Sophy, that is a very rare virtue amongst men of condition. Never
expect it when you marry; for, believe me, if you do, you will
certainly be deceived."

A gentle sigh stole from Sophia at these words, which perhaps
contributed to form a dream of no very pleasant kind; but, as she
never revealed this dream to any one, so the reader cannot expect to
see it related here.



Chapter ix.

The morning introduced in some pretty writing. A stagecoach. The
civility of chambermaids. The heroic temper of Sophia. Her generosity.
The return to it. The departure of the company, and their arrival at
London; with some remarks for the use of travellers.


Those members of society who are born to furnish the blessings of life
now began to light their candles, in order to pursue their daily
labours for the use of those who are born to enjoy these blessings.
The sturdy hind now attends the levee of his fellow-labourer the ox;
the cunning artificer, the diligent mechanic, spring from their hard
mattress; and now the bonny housemaid begins to repair the disordered
drum-room, while the riotous authors of that disorder, in broken
interrupted slumbers, tumble and toss, as if the hardness of down
disquieted their repose.

In simple phrase, the clock had no sooner struck seven than the ladies
were ready for their journey; and, at their desire, his lordship and
his equipage were prepared to attend them.

And now a matter of some difficulty arose; and this was how his
lordship himself should be conveyed; for though in stage-coaches,
where passengers are properly considered as so much luggage, the
ingenious coachman stows half a dozen with perfect ease into the place
of four; for well he contrives that the fat hostess, or well-fed
alderman, may take up no more room than the slim miss, or taper
master; it being the nature of guts, when well squeezed, to give way,
and to lie in a narrow compass; yet in these vehicles, which are
called, for distinction's sake, gentlemen's coaches, though they are
often larger than the others, this method of packing is never
attempted.

His lordship would have put a short end to the difficulty, by very
gallantly desiring to mount his horse; but Mrs Fitzpatrick would by no
means consent to it. It was therefore concluded that the Abigails
should, by turns, relieve each other on one of his lordship's horses,
which was presently equipped with a side-saddle for that purpose.

Everything being settled at the inn, the ladies discharged their
former guides, and Sophia made a present to the landlord, partly to
repair the bruise which he had received under herself, and partly on
account of what he had suffered under the hands of her enraged
waiting-woman. And now Sophia first discovered a loss which gave her
some uneasiness; and this was of the hundred-pound bank-bill which her
father had given her at their last meeting; and which, within a very
inconsiderable trifle, was all the treasure she was at present worth.
She searched everywhere, and shook and tumbled all her things to no
purpose, the bill was not to be found: and she was at last fully
persuaded that she had lost it from her pocket when she had the
misfortune of tumbling from her horse in the dark lane, as before
recorded: a fact that seemed the more probable, as she now recollected
some discomposure in her pockets which had happened at that time, and
the great difficulty with which she had drawn forth her handkerchief
the very instant before her fall, in order to relieve the distress of
Mrs Fitzpatrick.

Misfortunes of this kind, whatever inconveniencies they may be
attended with, are incapable of subduing a mind in which there is any
strength, without the assistance of avarice. Sophia, therefore, though
nothing could be worse timed than this accident at such a season,
immediately got the better of her concern, and, with her wonted
serenity and cheerfulness of countenance, returned to her company. His
lordship conducted the ladies into the vehicle, as he did likewise Mrs
Honour, who, after many civilities, and more dear madams, at last
yielded to the well-bred importunities of her sister Abigail, and
submitted to be complimented with the first ride in the coach; in
which indeed she would afterwards have been contented to have pursued
her whole journey, had not her mistress, after several fruitless
intimations, at length forced her to take her turn on horseback.

The coach, now having received its company, began to move forwards,
attended by many servants, and led by two captains, who had before
rode with his lordship, and who would have been dismissed from the
vehicle upon a much less worthy occasion than was this of
accommodating two ladies. In this they acted only as gentlemen; but
they were ready at any time to have performed the office of a footman,
or indeed would have condescended lower, for the honour of his
lordship's company, and for the convenience of his table.

My landlord was so pleased with the present he had received from
Sophia, that he rather rejoiced in than regretted his bruise or his
scratches. The reader will perhaps be curious to know the _quantum_ of
this present; but we cannot satisfy his curiosity. Whatever it was, it
satisfied the landlord for his bodily hurt; but he lamented he had not
known before how little the lady valued her money; "For to be sure,"
says he, "one might have charged every article double, and she would
have made no cavil at the reckoning."

His wife, however, was far from drawing this conclusion; whether she
really felt any injury done to her husband more than he did himself, I
will not say: certain it is, she was much less satisfied with the
generosity of Sophia. "Indeed," cries she, "my dear, the lady knows
better how to dispose of her money than you imagine. She might very
well think we should not put up such a business without some
satisfaction, and the law would have cost her an infinite deal more
than this poor little matter, which I wonder you would take." "You are
always so bloodily wise," quoth the husband: "it would have cost her
more, would it? dost fancy I don't know that as well as thee? but
would any of that more, or so much, have come into our pockets?
Indeed, if son Tom the lawyer had been alive, I could have been glad
to have put such a pretty business into his hands. He would have got a
good picking out of it; but I have no relation now who is a lawyer,
and why should I go to law for the benefit of strangers?" "Nay, to be
sure," answered she, "you must know best." "I believe I do," replied
he. "I fancy, when money is to be got, I can smell it out as well as
another. Everybody, let me tell you, would not have talked people out
of this. Mind that, I say; everybody would not have cajoled this out
of her, mind that." The wife then joined in the applause of her
husband's sagacity; and thus ended the short dialogue between them on
this occasion.

We will therefore take our leave of these good people, and attend his
lordship and his fair companions, who made such good expedition that
they performed a journey of ninety miles in two days, and on the
second evening arrived in London, without having encountered any one
adventure on the road worthy the dignity of this history to relate.
Our pen, therefore, shall imitate the expedition which it describes,
and our history shall keep pace with the travellers who are its
subject. Good writers will, indeed, do well to imitate the ingenious
traveller in this instance, who always proportions his stay at any
place to the beauties, elegancies, and curiosities which it affords.
At Eshur, at Stowe, at Wilton, at Eastbury, and at Prior's Park, days
are too short for the ravished imagination; while we admire the
wondrous power of art in improving nature. In some of these, art
chiefly engages our admiration; in others, nature and art contend for
our applause; but, in the last, the former seems to triumph. Here
Nature appears in her richest attire, and Art, dressed with the
modestest simplicity, attends her benignant mistress. Here Nature
indeed pours forth the choicest treasures which she hath lavished on
this world; and here human nature presents you with an object which
can be exceeded only in the other.

The same taste, the same imagination, which luxuriously riots in these
elegant scenes, can be amused with objects of far inferior note. The
woods, the rivers, the lawns of Devon and of Dorset, attract the eye
of the ingenious traveller, and retard his pace, which delay he
afterwards compensates by swiftly scouring over the gloomy heath of
Bagshot, or that pleasant plain which extends itself westward from
Stockbridge, where no other object than one single tree only in
sixteen miles presents itself to the view, unless the clouds, in
compassion to our tired spirits, kindly open their variegated mansions
to our prospect.

Not so travels the money-meditating tradesman, the sagacious justice,
the dignified doctor, the warm-clad grazier, with all the numerous
offspring of wealth and dulness. On they jog, with equal pace, through
the verdant meadows or over the barren heath, their horses measuring
four miles and a half per hour with the utmost exactness; the eyes of
the beast and of his master being alike directed forwards, and
employed in contemplating the same objects in the same manner. With
equal rapture the good rider surveys the proudest boasts of the
architect, and those fair buildings with which some unknown name hath
adorned the rich cloathing town; where heaps of bricks are piled up as
a kind of monument to show that heaps of money have been piled there
before.

And now, reader, as we are in haste to attend our heroine, we will
leave to thy sagacity to apply all this to the Boeotian writers, and
to those authors who are their opposites. This thou wilt be abundantly
able to perform without our aid. Bestir thyself therefore on this
occasion; for, though we will always lend thee proper assistance in
difficult places, as we do not, like some others, expect thee to use
the arts of divination to discover our meaning, yet we shall not
indulge thy laziness where nothing but thy own attention is required;
for thou art highly mistaken if thou dost imagine that we intended,
when we began this great work, to leave thy sagacity nothing to do; or
that, without sometimes exercising this talent, thou wilt be able to
travel through our pages with any pleasure or profit to thyself.



Chapter x.

Containing a hint or two concerning virtue, and a few more concerning
suspicion.


Our company, being arrived at London, were set down at his lordship's
house, where, while they refreshed themselves after the fatigue of
their journey, servants were despatched to provide a lodging for the
two ladies; for, as her ladyship was not then in town, Mrs Fitzpatrick
would by no means consent to accept a bed in the mansion of the peer.

Some readers will, perhaps, condemn this extraordinary delicacy, as I
may call it, of virtue, as too nice and scrupulous; but we must make
allowances for her situation, which must be owned to have been very
ticklish; and, when we consider the malice of censorious tongues, we
must allow, if it was a fault, the fault was an excess on the right
side, and which every woman who is in the self-same situation will do
well to imitate. The most formal appearance of virtue, when it is only
an appearance, may, perhaps, in very abstracted considerations, seem
to be rather less commendable than virtue itself without this
formality; but it will, however, be always more commended; and this, I
believe, will be granted by all, that it is necessary, unless in some
very particular cases, for every woman to support either the one or
the other.

A lodging being prepared, Sophia accompanied her cousin for that
evening; but resolved early in the morning to enquire after the lady
into whose protection, as we have formerly mentioned, she had
determined to throw herself when she quitted her father's house. And
this she was the more eager in doing from some observations she had
made during her journey in the coach.

Now, as we would by no means fix the odious character of suspicion on
Sophia, we are almost afraid to open to our reader the conceits which
filled her mind concerning Mrs Fitzpatrick; of whom she certainly
entertained at present some doubts; which, as they are very apt to
enter into the bosoms of the worst of people, we think proper not to
mention more plainly till we have first suggested a word or two to our
reader touching suspicion in general.

Of this there have always appeared to me to be two degrees. The first
of these I chuse to derive from the heart, as the extreme velocity of
its discernment seems to denote some previous inward impulse, and the
rather as this superlative degree often forms its own objects; sees
what is not, and always more than really exists. This is that
quick-sighted penetration whose hawk's eyes no symptom of evil can
escape; which observes not only upon the actions, but upon the words
and looks, of men; and, as it proceeds from the heart of the observer,
so it dives into the heart of the observed, and there espies evil, as
it were, in the first embryo; nay, sometimes before it can be said to
be conceived. An admirable faculty, if it were infallible; but, as this
degree of perfection is not even claimed by more than one mortal being;
so from the fallibility of such acute discernment have arisen many sad
mischiefs and most grievous heart-aches to innocence and virtue. I
cannot help, therefore, regarding this vast quick-sightedness into evil
as a vicious excess, and as a very pernicious evil in itself. And I am
the more inclined to this opinion, as I am afraid it always proceeds
from a bad heart, for the reasons I have above mentioned, and for one
more, namely, because I never knew it the property of a good one. Now,
from this degree of suspicion I entirely and absolutely acquit Sophia.

A second degree of this quality seems to arise from the head. This is,
indeed, no other than the faculty of seeing what is before your eyes,
and of drawing conclusions from what you see. The former of these is
unavoidable by those who have any eyes, and the latter is perhaps no
less certain and necessary a consequence of our having any brains.
This is altogether as bitter an enemy to guilt as the former is to
innocence: nor can I see it in an unamiable light, even though,
through human fallibility, it should be sometimes mistaken. For
instance, if a husband should accidentally surprize his wife in the
lap or in the embraces of some of those pretty young gentlemen who
profess the art of cuckold-making, I should not highly, I think, blame
him for concluding something more than what he saw, from the
familiarities which he really had seen, and which we are at least
favourable enough to when we call them innocent freedoms. The reader
will easily suggest great plenty of instances to himself; I shall add
but one more, which, however unchristian it may be thought by some, I
cannot help esteeming to be strictly justifiable; and this is a
suspicion that a man is capable of doing what he hath done already,
and that it is possible for one who hath been a villain once to act
the same part again. And, to confess the truth, of this degree of
suspicion I believe Sophia was guilty. From this degree of suspicion
she had, in fact, conceived an opinion that her cousin was really not
better than she should be.

The case, it seems, was this: Mrs Fitzpatrick wisely considered that
the virtue of a young lady is, in the world, in the same situation
with a poor hare, which is certain, whenever it ventures abroad, to
meet its enemies; for it can hardly meet any other. No sooner
therefore was she determined to take the first opportunity of quitting
the protection of her husband, than she resolved to cast herself under
the protection of some other man; and whom could she so properly
choose to be her guardian as a person of quality, of fortune, of
honour; and who, besides a gallant disposition which inclines men to
knight-errantry, that is, to be the champions of ladies in distress,
had often declared a violent attachment to herself, and had already
given her all the instances of it in his power?

But, as the law hath foolishly omitted this office of vice-husband, or
guardian to an eloped lady, and as malice is apt to denominate him by
a more disagreeable appellation, it was concluded that his lordship
should perform all such kind offices to the lady in secret, and
without publickly assuming the character of her protector. Nay, to
prevent any other person from seeing him in this light, it was agreed
that the lady should proceed directly to Bath, and that his lordship
should first go to London, and thence should go down to that place by
the advice of his physicians.

Now all this Sophia very plainly understood, not from the lips or
behaviour of Mrs Fitzpatrick, but from the peer, who was infinitely
less expert at retaining a secret than was the good lady; and perhaps
the exact secrecy which Mrs Fitzpatrick had observed on this head in
her narrative served not a little to heighten those suspicions which
were now risen in the mind of her cousin.

Sophia very easily found out the lady she sought; for indeed there was
not a chairman in town to whom her house was not perfectly well known;
and, as she received, in return of her first message, a most pressing
invitation, she immediately accepted it. Mrs Fitzpatrick, indeed, did
not desire her cousin to stay with her with more earnestness than
civility required. Whether she had discerned and resented the
suspicion above-mentioned, or from what other motive it arose, I
cannot say; but certain it is, she was full as desirous of parting
with Sophia as Sophia herself could be of going.

The young lady, when she came to take leave of her cousin, could not
avoid giving her a short hint of advice. She begged her, for heaven's
sake, to take care of herself, and to consider in how dangerous a
situation she stood; adding, she hoped some method would be found of
reconciling her to her husband. "You must remember, my dear," says
she, "the maxim which my aunt Western hath so often repeated to us
both; That whenever the matrimonial alliance is broke, and war
declared between husband and wife, she can hardly make a
disadvantageous peace for herself on any conditions. These are my
aunt's very words, and she hath had a great deal of experience in the
world." Mrs Fitzpatrick answered, with a contemptuous smile, "Never
fear me, child, take care of yourself; for you are younger than I. I
will come and visit you in a few days; but, dear Sophy, let me give
you one piece of advice: leave the character of Graveairs in the
country, for, believe me, it will sit very awkwardly upon you in this
town."

Thus the two cousins parted, and Sophia repaired directly to Lady
Bellaston, where she found a most hearty, as well as a most polite,
welcome. The lady had taken a great fancy to her when she had seen her
formerly with her aunt Western. She was indeed extremely glad to see
her, and was no sooner acquainted with the reasons which induced her
to leave the squire and to fly to London than she highly applauded her
sense and resolution; and after expressing the highest satisfaction in
the opinion which Sophia had declared she entertained of her ladyship,
by chusing her house for an asylum, she promised her all the
protection which it was in her power to give.

As we have now brought Sophia into safe hands, the reader will, I
apprehend, be contented to deposit her there a while, and to look a
little after other personages, and particularly poor Jones, whom we
have left long enough to do penance for his past offences, which, as
is the nature of vice, brought sufficient punishment upon him
themselves.




BOOK XII.

CONTAINING THE SAME INDIVIDUAL TIME WITH THE FORMER.



Chapter i.

Showing what is to be deemed plagiarism in a modern author, and what
is to be considered as lawful prize.


The learned reader must have observed that in the course of this
mighty work, I have often translated passages out of the best antient
authors, without quoting the original, or without taking thes been motive sufficient, he would not have ventured to
blow the temper of Lady Bellaston into that flame of which he had
reason to think it susceptible, and of which he feared the consequence
might be a discovery to Sophia, which he dreaded. After some
discontented walks therefore about the room, he was preparing to
depart, when the lady kindly prevented him, not by another letter, but
by her own presence. She entered the room very disordered in her
dress, and very discomposed in her looks, and threw herself into a
chair, where, having recovered her breath, she said--"You see, sir,
when women have gone one length too far, they will stop at none. If
any person would have sworn this to me a week ago, I would not have
believed it of myself." "I hope, madam," said Jones, "my charming Lady
Bellaston will be as difficult to believe anything against one who is
so sensible of the many obligations she hath conferred upon him."
"Indeed!" says she, "sensible of obligations! Did I expect to hear
such cold language from Mr Jones?" "Pardon me, my dear angel," said
he, "if, after the letters I have received, the terrors of your anger,
though I know not how I have deserved it."--"And have I then," says
she, with a smile, "so angry a countenance?--Have I really brought a
chiding face with me?"--"If there be honour in man," said he, "I have
done nothing to merit your anger.--You remember the appointment you
sent me; I went in pursuance."--"I beseech you," cried she, "do not
run through the odious recital.--Answer me but one question, and I
shall be easy. Have you not betrayed my honour to her?"--Jones fell
upon his knees, and began to utter the most violent protestations,
when Partridge came dancing and capering into the room, like one drunk
with joy, crying out, "She's found! she's found!--Here, sir, here,
she's here--Mrs Honour is upon the stairs." "Stop her a moment," cries
Jones--"Here, madam, step behind the bed, I have no other room nor
closet, nor place on earth to hide you in; sure never was so damned an
accident."--"D--n'd indeed!" said the lady, as she went to her place
of concealment; and presently afterwards in came Mrs Honour.
"Hey-day!" says she, "Mr Jones, what's the matter?--That impudent
rascal your servant would scarce let me come upstairs. I hope he hath
not the same reason to keep me from you as he had at Upton.--I suppose
you hardly expected to see me; but you have certainly bewitched my
lady. Poor dear young lady! To be sure, I loves her as tenderly as if
she was my own sister. Lord have mercy upon you, if you don't make her
a good husband! and to be sure, if you do not, nothing can be bad
enough for you." Jones begged her only to whisper, for that there was
a lady dying in the next room. "A lady!" cries she; "ay, I suppose one
of your ladies.--O Mr Jones, there are too many of them in the world;
I believe we are got into the house of one, for my Lady Bellaston I
darst to say is no better than she should be."--"Hush! hush!" cries
Jones, "every word is overheard in the next room." "I don't care a
farthing," cries Honour, "I speaks no scandal of any one; but to be
sure the servants make no scruple of saying as how her ladyship meets
men at another place--where the house goes under the name of a poor
gentlewoman; but her ladyship pays the rent, and many's the good thing
besides, they say, she hath of her."--Here Jones, after expressing the
utmost uneasiness, offered to stop her mouth:--"Hey-day! why sure, Mr
Jones, you will let me speak; I speaks no scandal, for I only says
what I heard from others--and thinks I to myself, much good may it do
the gentlewoman with her riches, if she comes by it in such a wicked
manner. To be sure it is better to be poor and honest." "The servants
are villains," cries Jones, "and abuse their lady unjustly."--"Ay, to
be sure, servants are always villains, and so my lady says, and won't
hear a word of it."--"No, I am convinced," says Jones, "my Sophia is
above listening to such base scandal." "Nay, I believe it is no
scandal, neither," cries Honour, "for why should she meet men at
another house?--It can never be for any good: for if she had a lawful
design of being courted, as to be sure any lady may lawfully give her
company to men upon that account: why, where can be the sense?"--"I
protest," cries Jones, "I can't hear all this of a lady of such
honour, and a relation of Sophia; besides, you will distract the poor
lady in the next room.--Let me entreat you to walk with me down
stairs."--"Nay, sir, if you won't let me speak, I have done.--Here,
sir, is a letter from my young lady--what would some men give to have
this? But, Mr Jones, I think you are not over and above generous, and
yet I have heard some servants say----but I am sure you will do me the
justice to own I never saw the colour of your money." Here Jones
hastily took the letter, and presently after slipped five pieces into
her hand. He then returned a thousand thanks to his dear Sophia in a
whisper, and begged her to leave him to read her letter: she presently
departed, not without expressing much grateful sense of his
generosity.

Lady Bellaston now came from behind the curtain. How shall I describe
her rage? Her tongue was at first incapable of utterance; but streams
of fire darted from her eyes, and well indeed they might, for her
heart was all in a flame. And now as soon as her voice found way,
instead of expressing any indignation against Honour or her own
servants, she began to attack poor Jones. "You see," said she, "what I
have sacrificed to you; my reputation, my honour--gone for ever! And
what return have I found? Neglected, slighted for a country girl, for
an idiot."--"What neglect, madam, or what slight," cries Jones, "have
I been guilty of?"--"Mr Jones," said she, "it is in vain to dissemble;
if you will make me easy, you must entirely give her up; and as a
proof of your intention, show me the letter."--"What letter, madam?"
said Jones. "Nay, surely," said she, "you cannot have the confidence
to deny your having received a letter by the hands of that
trollop."--"And can your ladyship," cries he, "ask of me what I must
part with my honour before I grant? Have I acted in such a manner by
your ladyship? Could I be guilty of betraying this poor innocent girl
to you, what security could you have that I should not act the same
part by yourself? A moment's reflection will, I am sure, convince you
that a man with whom the secrets of a lady are not safe must be the
most contemptible of wretches."--"Very well," said she--"I need not
insist on your becoming this contemptible wretch in your own opinion;
for the inside of the letter could inform me of nothing more than I
know already. I see the footing you are upon."--Here ensued a long
conversation, which the reader, who is not too curious, will thank me
for not inserting at length. It shall suffice, therefore, to inform
him, that Lady Bellaston grew more and more pacified, and at length
believed, or affected to believe, his protestations, that his meeting
with Sophia that evening was merely accidental, and every other matter
which the reader already knows, and which, as Jones set before her in
the strongest light, it is plain that she had in reality no reason to
be angry with him.

She was not, however, in her heart perfectly satisfied with his
refusal to show her the letter; so deaf are we to the clearest reason,
when it argues against our prevailing passions. She was, indeed, well
convinced that Sophia possessed the first place in Jones's affections;
and yet, haughty and amorous as this lady was, she submitted at last
to bear the second place; or, to express it more properly in a legal
phrase, was contented with the possession of that of which another
woman had the reversion.

It was at length agreed that Jones should for the future visit at the
house: for that Sophia, her maid, and all the servants, would place
these visits to the account of Sophia; and that she herself would be
considered as the person imposed upon.

This scheme was contrived by the lady, and highly relished by Jones,
who was indeed glad to have a prospect of seeing his Sophia at any
rate; and the lady herself was not a little pleased with the
imposition on Sophia, which Jones, she thought, could not possibly
discover to her for his own sake.

The next day was appointed for the first visit, and then, after proper
ceremonials, the Lady Bellaston returned home.



Chapter iii.

Containing various matters.


Jones was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his letter, and
read as follows:--

  "Sir, it is impossible to express what I have suffered since you
  left this house; and as I have reason to think you intend coming
  here again, I have sent Honour, though so late at night, as she
  tells me she knows your lodgings, to prevent you. I charge you, by
  all the regard you have for me, not to think of visiting here; for
  it will certainly be discovered; nay, I almost doubt, from some
  things which have dropt from her ladyship, that she is not already
  without some suspicion. Something favourable perhaps may happen; we
  must wait with patience; but I once more entreat you, if you have
  any concern for my ease, do not think of returning hither."

This letter administered the same kind of consolation to poor Jones,
which Job formerly received from his friends. Besides disappointing
all the hopes which he promised to himself from seeing Sophia, he was
reduced to an unhappy dilemma, with regard to Lady Bellaston; for
there are some certain engagements, which, as he well knew, do very
difficultly admit of any excuse for the failure; and to go, after the
strict prohibition from Sophia, he was not to be forced by any human
power. At length, after much deliberation, which during that night
supplied the place of sleep, he determined to feign himself sick: for
this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed
visit, without incensing Lady Bellaston, which he had more than one
reason of desiring to avoid.

The first thing, however, which he did in the morning, was, to write
an answer to Sophia, which he inclosed in one to Honour. He then
despatched another to Lady Bellaston, containing the above-mentioned
excuse; and to this he soon received the following answer:--

  "I am vexed that I cannot see you here this afternoon, but more
  concerned for the occasion; take great care of yourself, and have
  the best advice, and I hope there will be no danger.--I am so
  tormented all this morning with fools, that I have scarce a moment's
  time to write to you. Adieu.

  "_P.S._--I will endeavour to call on you this evening, at nine.--Be
  sure to be alone."

Mr Jones now received a visit from Mrs Miller, who, after some formal
introduction, began the following speech:--"I am very sorry, sir, to
wait upon you on such an occasion; but I hope you will consider the
ill consequence which it must be to the reputation of my poor girls,
if my house should once be talked of as a house of ill-fame. I hope
you won't think me, therefore, guilty of impertinence, if I beg you
not to bring any more ladies in at that time of night. The clock had
struck two before one of them went away."--"I do assure you, madam,"
said Jones, "the lady who was here last night, and who staid the
latest (for the other only brought me a letter), is a woman of very
great fashion, and my near relation."--"I don't know what fashion she
is of," answered Mrs Miller; "but I am sure no woman of virtue, unless
a very near relation indeed, would visit a young gentleman at ten at
night, and stay four hours in his room with him alone; besides, sir,
the behaviour of her chairmen shows what she was; for they did nothing
but make jests all the evening in the entry, and asked Mr Partridge,
in the hearing of my own maid, if madam intended to stay with his
master all night; with a great deal of stuff not proper to be
repeated. I have really a great respect for you, Mr Jones, upon your
own account; nay, I have a very high obligation to you for your
generosity to my cousin. Indeed, I did not know how very good you had
been till lately. Little did I imagine to what dreadful courses the
poor man's distress had driven him. Little did I think, when you gave
me the ten guineas, that you had given them to a highwayman! O
heavens! what goodness have you shown! How have you preserved this
family!--The character which Mr Allworthy hath formerly given me of
you was, I find, strictly true.--And indeed, if I had no obligation to
you, my obligations to him are such, that, on his account, I should
shew you the utmost respect in my power.--Nay, believe me, dear Mr
Jones, if my daughters' and my own reputation were out of the case, I
should, for your own sake, be sorry that so pretty a young gentleman
should converse with these women; but if you are resolved to do it, I
must beg you to take another lodging; for I do not myself like to have
such things carried on under my roof; but more especially upon the
account of my girls, who have little, heaven knows, besides their
characters, to recommend them." Jones started and changed colour at
the name of Allworthy. "Indeed, Mrs Miller," answered he, a little
warmly, "I do not take this at all kind. I will never bring any
slander on your house; but I must insist on seeing what company I
please in my own room; and if that gives you any offence, I shall, as
soon as I am able, look for another lodging."--"I am sorry we must
part then, sir," said she; "but I am convinced Mr Allworthy himself
would never come within my doors, if he had the least suspicion of my
keeping an ill house."--"Very well, madam," said Jones.--"I hope,
sir," said she, "you are not angry; for I would not for the world
offend any of Mr Allworthy's family. I have not slept a wink all night
about this matter."--"I am sorry I have disturbed your rest, madam,"
said Jones, "but I beg you will send Partridge up to me immediately;"
which she promised to do, and then with a very low courtesy retired.

As soon as Partridge arrived, Jones fell upon him in the most
outrageous manner. "How often," said he, "am I to suffer for your
folly, or rather for my own in keeping you? is that tongue of yours
resolved upon my destruction?" "What have I done, sir?" answered
affrighted Partridge. "Who was it gave you authority to mention the
story of the robbery, or that the man you saw here was the person?"
"I, sir?" cries Partridge. "Now don't be guilty of a falsehood in
denying it," said Jones. "If I did mention such a matter," answers
Partridge, "I am sure I thought no harm; for I should not have opened
my lips, if it had not been to his own friends and relations, who, I
imagined, would have let it go no farther." "But I have a much heavier
charge against you," cries Jones, "than this. How durst you, after all
the precautions I gave you, mention the name of Mr Allworthy in this
house?" Partridge denied that he ever had, with many oaths. "How
else," said Jones, "should Mrs Miller be acquainted that there was any
connexion between him and me? And it is but this moment she told me
she respected me on his account." "O Lord, sir," said Partridge, "I
desire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was anything so
unfortunate: hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have
accused me. When Mrs Honour came downstairs last night she met me in
the entry, and asked me when my master had heard from Mr Allworthy;
and to be sure Mrs Miller heard the very words; and the moment Madam
Honour was gone, she called me into the parlour to her. `Mr
Partridge,' says she, `what Mr Allworthy is it that the gentlewoman
mentioned? is it the great Mr Allworthy of Somersetshire?' `Upon my
word, madam,' says I, `I know nothing of the matter.' `Sure,' says
she, `your master is not the Mr Jones I have heard Mr Allworthy talk
of?' `Upon my word, madam,' says I, `I know nothing of the matter.'
`Then,' says she, turning to her daughter Nancy, says she, `as sure as
tenpence this is the very young gentleman, and he agrees exactly with
the squire's description.' The Lord above knows who it was told her:
for I am the arrantest villain that ever walked upon two legs if ever
it came out of my mouth. I promise you, sir, I can keep a secret when
I am desired. Nay, sir, so far was I from telling her anything about
Mr Allworthy, that I told her the very direct contrary; for, though I
did not contradict it at that moment, yet, as second thoughts, they
say, are best, so when I came to consider that somebody must have
informed her, thinks I to myself, I will put an end to the story; and
so I went back again into the parlour some time afterwards, and says
I, upon my word, says I, whoever, says I, told you that this gentleman
was Mr Jones; that is, says I, that this Mr Jones was that Mr Jones,
told you a confounded lie: and I beg, says I, you will never mention
any such matter, says I; for my master, says I, will think I must have
told you so; and I defy anybody in the house ever to say I mentioned
any such word. To be certain, sir, it is a wonderful thing, and I have
been thinking with myself ever since, how it was she came to know it;
not but I saw an old woman here t'other day a begging at the door, who
looked as like her we saw in Warwickshire, that caused all that
mischief to us. To be sure it is never good to pass by an old woman
without giving her something, especially if she looks at you; for all
the world shall never persuade me but that they have a great power to
do mischief, and to be sure I shall never see an old woman again, but
I shall think to myself, _Infandum, regina, jubes renovare dolorem._"

The simplicity of Partridge set Jones a laughing, and put a final end
to his anger, which had indeed seldom any long duration in his mind;
and, instead of commenting on his defence, he told him he intended
presently to leave those lodgings, and ordered him to go and endeavour
to get him others.



Chapter iv.

Which we hope will be very attentively perused by young people of both
sexes.


Partridge had no sooner left Mr Jones than Mr Nightingale, with whom
he had now contracted a great intimacy, came to him, and, after a
short salutation, said, "So, Tom, I hear you had company very late
last night. Upon my soul you are a happy fellow, who have not been in
town above a fortnight, and can keep chairs waiting at your door till
two in the morning." He then ran on with much commonplace raillery of
the same kind, till Jones at last interrupted him, saying, "I suppose
you have received all this information from Mrs Miller, who hath been
up here a little while ago to give me warning. The good woman is
afraid, it seems, of the reputation of her daughters." "Oh! she is
wonderfully nice," says Nightingale, "upon that account; if you
remember, she would not let Nancy go with us to the masquerade." "Nay,
upon my honour, I think she's in the right of it," says Jones:
"however, I have taken her at her word, and have sent Partridge to
look for another lodging." "If you will," says Nightingale, "we may, I
believe, be again together; for, to tell you a secret, which I desire
you won't mention in the family, I intend to quit the house to-day."
"What, hath Mrs Miller given you warning too, my friend?" cries Jones.
"No," answered the other; "but the rooms are not convenient enough.
Besides, I am grown weary of this part of the town. I want to be
nearer the places of diversion; so I am going to Pall-mall." "And do
you intend to make a secret of your going away?" said Jones. "I
promise you," answered Nightingale, "I don't intend to bilk my
lodgings; but I have a private reason for not taking a formal leave."
"Not so private," answered Jones; "I promise you, I have seen it ever
since the second day of my coming to the house. Here will be some wet
eyes on your departure. Poor Nancy, I pity her, faith! Indeed, Jack,
you have played the fool with that girl. You have given her a longing,
which I am afraid nothing will ever cure her of." Nightingale
answered, "What the devil would you have me do? would you have me
marry her to cure her?" "No," answered Jones, "I would not have had
you make love to her, as you have often done in my presence. I have
been astonished at the blindness of her mother in never seeing it."
"Pugh, see it!" cries Nightingale. "What, the devil should she see?"
"Why, see," said Jones, "that you have made her daughter distractedly
in love with you. The poor girl cannot conceal it a moment; her eyes
are never off from you, and she always colours every time you come
into the room. Indeed, I pity her heartily; for she seems to be one of
the best-natured and honestest of human creatures." "And so," answered
Nightingale, "according to your doctrine, one must not amuse oneself
by any common gallantries with women, for fear they should fall in
love with us." "Indeed, Jack," said Jones, "you wilfully misunderstand
me; I do not fancy women are so apt to fall in love; but you have gone
far beyond common gallantries." "What, do you suppose," says
Nightingale, "that we have been a-bed together?" "No, upon my honour,"
answered Jones, very seriously, "I do not suppose so ill of you; nay,
I will go farther, I do not imagine you have laid a regular
premeditated scheme for the destruction of the quiet of a poor little
creature, or have even foreseen the consequence: for I am sure thou
art a very good-natured fellow; and such a one can never be guilty of
a cruelty of that kind; but at the same time you have pleased your own
vanity, without considering that this poor girl was made a sacrifice
to it; and while you have had no design but of amusing an idle hour,
you have actually given her reason to flatter herself that you had the
most serious designs in her favour. Prithee, Jack, answer me honestly;
to what have tended all those elegant and luscious descriptions of
happiness arising from violent and mutual fondness? all those warm
professions of tenderness, and generous disinterested love? Did you
imagine she would not apply them? or, speak ingenuously, did not you
intend she should?" "Upon my soul, Tom," cries Nightingale, "I did not
think this was in thee. Thou wilt make an admirable parson. So I
suppose you would not go to bed to Nancy now, if she would let you?"
"No," cries Jones, "may I be d--n'd if I would." "Tom, Tom," answered
Nightingale, "last night; remember last night----

     When every eye was closed, and the pale moon,
     And silent stars, shone conscious of the theft."

"Lookee, Mr Nightingale," said Jones, "I am no canting hypocrite, nor
do I pretend to the gift of chastity, more than my neighbours. I have
been guilty with women, I own it; but am not conscious that I have
ever injured any.--Nor would I, to procure pleasure to myself, be
knowingly the cause of misery to any human being."

"Well, well," said Nightingale, "I believe you, and I am convinced you
acquit me of any such thing."

"I do, from my heart," answered Jones, "of having debauched the girl,
but not from having gained her affections."

"If I have," said Nightingale, "I am sorry for it; but time and
absence will soon wear off such impressions. It is a receipt I must
take myself; for, to confess the truth to you--I never liked any girl
half so much in my whole life; but I must let you into the whole
secret, Tom. My father hath provided a match for me with a woman I
never saw; and she is now coming to town, in order for me to make my
addresses to her."

At these words Jones burst into a loud fit of laughter; when
Nightingale cried--"Nay, prithee, don't turn me into ridicule. The
devil take me if I am not half mad about this matter! my poor Nancy!
Oh! Jones, Jones, I wish I had a fortune in my own possession."

"I heartily wish you had," cries Jones; "for, if this be the case, I
sincerely pity you both; but surely you don't intend to go away
without taking your leave of her?"

"I would not," answered Nightingale, "undergo the pain of taking
leave, for ten thousand pounds; besides, I am convinced, instead of
answering any good purpose, it would only serve to inflame my poor
Nancy the more. I beg, therefore, you would not mention a word of it
to-day, and in the evening, or to-morrow morning, I intend to depart."

Jones promised he would not; and said, upon reflection, he thought, as
he had determined and was obliged to leave her, he took the most
prudent method. He then told Nightingale he should be very glad to
lodge in the same house with him; and it was accordingly agreed
between them, that Nightingale should procure him either the ground
floor, or the two pair of stairs; for the young gentleman himself was
to occupy that which was between them.

This Nightingale, of whom we shall be presently obliged to say a
little more, was in the ordinary transactions of life a man of strict
honour, and, what is more rare among young gentlemen of the town, one
of strict honesty too; yet in affairs of love he was somewhat loose in
his morals; not that he was even here as void of principle as
gentlemen sometimes are, and oftener affect to be; but it is certain
he had been guilty of some indefensible treachery to women, and had,
in a certain mystery, called making love, practised many deceits,
which, if he had used in trade, he would have been counted the
greatest villain upon earth.

But as the world, I know not well for what reason, agree to see this
treachery in a better light, he was so far from being ashamed of his
iniquities of this kind, that he gloried in them, and would often
boast of his skill in gaining of women, and his triumphs over their
hearts, for which he had before this time received some rebukes from
Jones, who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to
the fair part of the species, who, if considered, he said, as they
ought to be, in the light of the dearest friends, were to be
cultivated, honoured, and caressed with the utmost love and
tenderness; but, if regarded as enemies, were a conquest of which a
man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it.



Chapter v.

A short account of the history of Mrs Miller.


Jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man, that is to
say, the larger half of a shoulder of mutton. In the afternoon he
received an invitation from Mrs Miller to drink tea; for that good
woman, having learnt, either by means of Partridge, or by some other
means natural or supernatural, that he had a connexion with Mr
Allworthy, could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an
angry manner.

Jones accepted the invitation; and no sooner was the tea-kettle
removed, and the girls sent out of the room, than the widow, without
much preface, began as follows: "Well, there are very surprizing
things happen in this world; but certainly it is a wonderful business
that I should have a relation of Mr Allworthy in my house, and never
know anything of the matter. Alas! sir, you little imagine what a
friend that best of gentlemen hath been to me and mine. Yes, sir, I am
not ashamed to own it; it is owing to his goodness that I did not long
since perish for want, and leave my poor little wretches, two
destitute, helpless, friendless orphans, to the care, or rather to the
cruelty, of the world.

"You must know, sir, though I am now reduced to get my living by
letting lodgings, I was born and bred a gentlewoman. My father was an
officer of the army, and died in a considerable rank: but he lived up
to his pay; and, as that expired with him, his family, at his death,
became beggars. We were three sisters. One of us had the good luck to
die soon after of the small-pox; a lady was so kind as to take the
second out of charity, as she said, to wait upon her. The mother of
this lady had been a servant to my grand-mother; and, having inherited
a vast fortune from her father, which he had got by pawnbroking, was
married to a gentleman of great estate and fashion. She used my sister
so barbarously, often upbraiding her with her birth and poverty,
calling her in derision a gentlewoman, that I believe she at length
broke the heart of the poor girl. In short, she likewise died within a
twelvemonth after my father. Fortune thought proper to provide better
for me, and within a month from his decease I was married to a
clergyman, who had been my lover a long time before, and who had been
very ill used by my father on that account: for though my poor father
could not give any of us a shilling, yet he bred us up as delicately,
considered us, and would have had us consider ourselves, as highly as
if we had been the richest heiresses. But my dear husband forgot all
this usage, and the moment we were become fatherless he immediately
renewed his addresses to me so warmly, that I, who always liked, and
now more than ever esteemed him, soon complied. Five years did I live
in a state of perfect happiness with that best of men, till at
last--Oh! cruel! cruel fortune, that ever separated us, that deprived
me of the kindest of husbands and my poor girls of the tenderest
parent.--O my poor girls! you never knew the blessing which ye
lost.--I am ashamed, Mr Jones, of this womanish weakness; but I shall
never mention him without tears." "I ought rather, madam," said Jones,
"to be ashamed that I do not accompany you." "Well, sir," continued
she, "I was now left a second time in a much worse condition than
before; besides the terrible affliction I was to encounter, I had now
two children to provide for; and was, if possible, more pennyless than
ever; when that great, that good, that glorious man, Mr Allworthy, who
had some little acquaintance with my husband, accidentally heard of my
distress, and immediately writ this letter to me. Here, sir, here it
is; I put it into my pocket to shew it you. This is the letter, sir; I
must and will read it to you.

  "'Madam,

  "'I heartily condole with you on your late grievous loss, which your
  own good sense, and the excellent lessons you must have learnt from
  the worthiest of men, will better enable you to bear than any advice
  which I am capable of giving. Nor have I any doubt that you, whom I
  have heard to be the tenderest of mothers, will suffer any
  immoderate indulgence of grief to prevent you from discharging your
  duty to those poor infants, who now alone stand in need of your
  tenderness.

  "`However, as you must be supposed at present to be incapable of
  much worldly consideration, you will pardon my having ordered a
  person to wait on you, and to pay you twenty guineas, which I beg
  you will accept till I have the pleasure of seeing you, and believe
  me to be, madam, &c.'

"This letter, sir, I received within a fortnight after the irreparable
loss I have mentioned; and within a fortnight afterwards, Mr
Allworthy--the blessed Mr Allworthy, came to pay me a visit, when he
placed me in the house where you now see me, gave me a large sum of
money to furnish it, and settled an annuity of £50 a-year upon me,
which I have constantly received ever since. Judge, then, Mr Jones, in
what regard I must hold a benefactor, to whom I owe the preservation
of my life, and of those dear children, for whose sake alone my life
is valuable. Do not, therefore, think me impertinent, Mr Jones (since
I must esteem one for whom I know Mr Allworthy hath so much value), if
I beg you not to converse with these wicked women. You are a young
gentleman, and do not know half their artful wiles. Do not be angry
with me, sir, for what I said upon account of my house; you must be
sensible it would be the ruin of my poor dear girls. Besides, sir, you
cannot but be acquainted that Mr Allworthy himself would never forgive
my conniving at such matters, and particularly with you."

"Upon my word, madam," said Jones, "you need make no farther apology;
nor do I in the least take anything ill you have said; but give me
leave, as no one can have more value than myself for Mr Allworthy, to
deliver you from one mistake, which, perhaps, would not be altogether
for his honour; I do assure you, I am no relation of his."

"Alas! sir," answered she, "I know you are not, I know very well who
you are; for Mr Allworthy hath told me all; but I do assure you, had
you been twenty times his son, he could not have expressed more regard
for you than he hath often expressed in my presence. You need not be
ashamed, sir, of what you are; I promise you no good person will
esteem you the less on that account. No, Mr Jones, the words
`dishonourable birth' are nonsense, as my dear, dear husband used to
say, unless the word `dishonourable' be applied to the parents; for
the children can derive no real dishonour from an act of which they
are intirely innocent."

Here Jones heaved a deep sigh, and then said, "Since I perceive,
madam, you really do know me, and Mr Allworthy hath thought proper to
mention my name to you; and since you have been so explicit with me as
to your own affairs, I will acquaint you with some more circumstances
concerning myself." And these Mrs Miller having expressed great desire
and curiosity to hear, he began and related to her his whole history,
without once mentioning the name of Sophia.

There is a kind of sympathy in honest minds, by means of which they
give an easy credit to each other. Mrs Miller believed all which Jones
told her to be true, and exprest much pity and concern for him. She
was beginning to comment on the story, but Jones interrupted her; for,
as the hour of assignation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a
second interview with the lady that evening, which he promised should
be the last at her house; swearing, at the same time, that she was one
of great distinction, and that nothing but what was intirely innocent
was to pass between them; and I do firmly believe he intended to keep
his word.

Mrs Miller was at length prevailed on, and Jones departed to his
chamber, where he sat alone till twelve o'clock, but no Lady Bellaston
appeared.

As we have said that this lady had a great affection for Jones, and as
it must have appeared that she really had so, the reader may perhaps
wonder at the first failure of her appointment, as she apprehended him
to be confined by sickness, a season when friendship seems most to
require such visits. This behaviour, therefore, in the lady, may, by
some, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our fault; for our
business is only to record truth.



Chapter vi.

Containing a scene which we doubt not will affect all our readers.


Mr Jones closed not his eyes during all the former part of the night;
not owing to any uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed
by Lady Bellaston; nor was Sophia herself, though most of his waking
hours were justly to be charged to her account, the present cause of
dispelling his slumbers. In fact, poor Jones was one of the
best-natured fellows alive, and had all that weakness which is called
compassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that
noble firmness of mind, which rolls a man, as it were, within himself,
and like a polished bowl, enables him to run through the world without
being once stopped by the calamities which happen to others. He could
not help, therefore, compassionating the situation of poor Nancy,
whose love for Mr Nightingale seemed to him so apparent, that he was
astonished at the blindness of her mother, who had more than once, the
preceding evening, remarked to him the great change in the temper of
her daughter, "who from being," she said, "one of the liveliest,
merriest girls in the world, was, on a sudden, become all gloom and
melancholy."

Sleep, however, at length got the better of all resistance; and now,
as if he had already been a deity, as the antients imagined, and an
offended one too, he seemed to enjoy his dear-bought conquest.--To
speak simply, and without any metaphor, Mr Jones slept till eleven the
next morning, and would, perhaps, have continued in the same quiet
situation much longer, had not a violent uproar awakened him.

Partridge was now summoned, who, being asked what was the matter,
answered, "That there was a dreadful hurricane below-stairs; that
Miss Nancy was in fits; and that the other sister, and the mother,
were both crying and lamenting over her." Jones expressed much
concern at this news; which Partridge endeavoured to relieve, by
saying, with a smile, "he fancied the young lady was in no danger of
death; for that Susan" (which was the name of the maid) "had given
him to understand, it was nothing more than a common affair. In
short," said he, "Miss Nancy hath had a mind to be as wise as her
mother; that's all; she was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat
down to dinner before grace was said; and so there is a child coming
for the Foundling Hospital."----"Prithee, leave thy stupid jesting,"
cries Jones. "Is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of
mirth? Go immediately to Mrs Miller, and tell her I beg leave--Stay,
you will make some blunder; I will go myself; for she desired me to
breakfast with her." He then rose and dressed himself as fast as he
could; and while he was dressing, Partridge, notwithstanding many
severe rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of
brutality, commonly called jests, on this occasion. Jones was no
sooner dressed than he walked downstairs, and knocking at the door,
was presently admitted by the maid, into the outward parlour, which
was as empty of company as it was of any apparatus for eating. Mrs
Miller was in the inner room with her daughter, whence the maid
presently brought a message to Mr Jones, "That her mistress hoped he
would excuse the disappointment, but an accident had happened, which
made it impossible for her to have the pleasure of his company at
breakfast that day; and begged his pardon for not sending him up
notice sooner." Jones desired, "She would give herself no trouble
about anything so trifling as his disappointment; that he was
heartily sorry for the occasion; and that if he could be of any
service to her, she might command him."

He had scarce spoke these words, when Mrs Miller, who heard them all,
suddenly threw open the door, and coming out to him, in a flood of
tears, said, "O Mr Jones! you are certainly one of the best young men
alive. I give you a thousand thanks for your kind offer of your
service; but, alas! sir, it is out of your power to preserve my poor
girl.--O my child! my child! she is undone, she is ruined for ever!"
"I hope, madam," said Jones, "no villain"----"O Mr Jones!" said she,
"that villain who yesterday left my lodgings, hath betrayed my poor
girl; hath destroyed her.--I know you are a man of honour. You have a
good--a noble heart, Mr Jones. The actions to which I have been myself
a witness, could proceed from no other. I will tell you all: nay,
indeed, it is impossible, after what hath happened, to keep it a
secret. That Nightingale, that barbarous villain, hath undone my
daughter. She is--she is--oh! Mr Jones, my girl is with child by him;
and in that condition he hath deserted her. Here! here, sir, is his
cruel letter: read it, Mr Jones, and tell me if such another monster
lives."

The letter was as follows:

  "DEAR NANCY,

  "As I found it impossible to mention to you what, I am afraid, will
  be no less shocking to you, than it is to me, I have taken this
  method to inform you, that my father insists upon my immediately
  paying my addresses to a young lady of fortune, whom he hath
  provided for my--I need not write the detested word. Your own good
  understanding will make you sensible, how entirely I am obliged to
  an obedience, by which I shall be for ever excluded from your dear
  arms. The fondness of your mother may encourage you to trust her
  with the unhappy consequence of our love, which may be easily kept a
  secret from the world, and for which I will take care to provide, as
  I will for you. I wish you may feel less on this account than I have
  suffered; but summon all your fortitude to your assistance, and
  forgive and forget the man, whom nothing but the prospect of certain
  ruin could have forced to write this letter. I bid you forget me, I
  mean only as a lover; but the best of friends you shall ever find in
  your faithful, though unhappy,

                                                        "J. N."

When Jones had read this letter, they both stood silent during a
minute, looking at each other; at last he began thus: "I cannot
express, madam, how much I am shocked at what I have read; yet let me
beg you, in one particular, to take the writer's advice. Consider the
reputation of your daughter."----"It is gone, it is lost, Mr Jones,"
cryed she, "as well as her innocence. She received the letter in a
room full of company, and immediately swooning away upon opening it,
the contents were known to every one present. But the loss of her
reputation, bad as it is, is not the worst; I shall lose my child; she
hath attempted twice to destroy herself already; and though she hath
been hitherto prevented, vows she will not outlive it; nor could I
myself outlive any accident of that nature.--What then will become of
my little Betsy, a helpless infant orphan? and the poor little wretch
will, I believe, break her heart at the miseries with which she sees
her sister and myself distracted, while she is ignorant of the cause.
O 'tis the most sensible, and best-natured little thing! The
barbarous, cruel----hath destroyed us all. O my poor children! Is this
the reward of all my cares? Is this the fruit of all my prospects?
Have I so chearfully undergone all the labours and duties of a mother?
Have I been so tender of their infancy, so careful of their education?
Have I been toiling so many years, denying myself even the
conveniences of life, to provide some little sustenance for them, to
lose one or both in such a manner?" "Indeed, madam," said Jones, with
tears in his eyes, "I pity you from my soul."--"O! Mr Jones," answered
she, "even you, though I know the goodness of your heart, can have no
idea of what I feel. The best, the kindest, the most dutiful of
children! O my poor Nancy, the darling of my soul! the delight of my
eyes! the pride of my heart! too much, indeed, my pride; for to those
foolish, ambitious hopes, arising from her beauty, I owe her ruin.
Alas! I saw with pleasure the liking which this young man had for her.
I thought it an honourable affection; and flattered my foolish vanity
with the thoughts of seeing her married to one so much her superior.
And a thousand times in my presence, nay, often in yours, he hath
endeavoured to soothe and encourage these hopes by the most generous
expressions of disinterested love, which he hath always directed to my
poor girl, and which I, as well as she, believed to be real. Could I
have believed that these were only snares laid to betray the innocence
of my child, and for the ruin of us all?"--At these words little Betsy
came running into the room, crying, "Dear mamma, for heaven's sake
come to my sister; for she is in another fit, and my cousin can't hold
her." Mrs Miller immediately obeyed the summons; but first ordered
Betsy to stay with Mr Jones, and begged him to entertain her a few
minutes, saying, in the most pathetic voice, "Good heaven! let me
preserve one of my children at least."

Jones, in compliance with this request, did all he could to comfort
the little girl, though he was, in reality, himself very highly
affected with Mrs Miller's story. He told her "Her sister would be
soon very well again; that by taking on in that manner she would not
only make her sister worse, but make her mother ill too." "Indeed,
sir," says she, "I would not do anything to hurt them for the world. I
would burst my heart rather than they should see me cry.--But my poor
sister can't see me cry.--I am afraid she will never be able to see me
cry any more. Indeed, I can't part with her; indeed, I can't.--And
then poor mamma too, what will become of her?--She says she will die
too, and leave me: but I am resolved I won't be left behind." "And are
you not afraid to die, my little Betsy?" said Jones. "Yes," answered
she, "I was always afraid to die; because I must have left my mamma,
and my sister; but I am not afraid of going anywhere with those I
love."

Jones was so pleased with this answer, that he eagerly kissed the
child; and soon after Mrs Miller returned, saying, "She thanked heaven
Nancy was now come to herself. And now, Betsy," says she, "you may go
in, for your sister is better, and longs to see you." She then turned
to Jones, and began to renew her apologies for having disappointed him
of his breakfast.

"I hope, madam," said Jones, "I shall have a more exquisite repast
than any you could have provided for me. This, I assure you, will be
the case, if I can do any service to this little family of love. But
whatever success may attend my endeavours, I am resolved to attempt
it. I am very much deceived in Mr Nightingale, if, notwithstanding
what hath happened, he hath not much goodness of heart at the bottom,
as well as a very violent affection for your daughter. If this be the
case, I think the picture which I shall lay before him will affect
him. Endeavour, madam, to comfort yourself, and Miss Nancy, as well as
you can. I will go instantly in quest of Mr Nightingale; and I hope to
bring you good news."

Mrs Miller fell upon her knees and invoked all the blessings of heaven
upon Mr Jones; to which she afterwards added the most passionate
expressions of gratitude. He then departed to find Mr Nightingale, and
the good woman returned to comfort her daughter, who was somewhat
cheared at what her mother told her; and both joined in resounding the
praises of Mr Jones.



Chapter vii.

The interview between Mr Jones and Mr Nightingale.


The good or evil we confer on others very often, I believe, recoils on
ourselves. For as men of a benign disposition enjoy their own acts of
beneficence equally with those to whom they are done, so there are
scarce any natures so entirely diabolical, as to be capable of doing
injuries, without paying themselves some pangs for the ruin which they
bring on their fellow-creatures.

Mr Nightingale, at least, was not such a person. On the contrary,
Jones found him in his new lodgings, sitting melancholy by the fire,
and silently lamenting the unhappy situation in which he had placed
poor Nancy. He no sooner saw his friend appear than he arose hastily
to meet him; and after much congratulation said, "Nothing could be
more opportune than this kind visit; for I was never more in the
spleen in my life."

"I am sorry," answered Jones, "that I bring news very unlikely to
relieve you: nay, what I am convinced must, of all other, shock you
the most. However, it is necessary you should know it. Without further
preface, then, I come to you, Mr Nightingale, from a worthy family,
which you have involved in misery and ruin." Mr Nightingale changed
colour at these words; but Jones, without regarding it, proceeded, in
the liveliest manner, to paint the tragical story with which the
reader was acquainted in the last chapter.

Nightingale never once interrupted the narration, though he discovered
violent emotions at many parts of it. But when it was concluded, after
fetching a deep sigh, he said, "What you tell me, my friend, affects
me in the tenderest manner. Sure there never was so cursed an accident
as the poor girl's betraying my letter. Her reputation might otherwise
have been safe, and the affair might have remained a profound secret;
and then the girl might have gone off never the worse; for many such
things happen in this town: and if the husband should suspect a
little, when it is too late, it will be his wiser conduct to conceal
his suspicion both from his wife and the world."

"Indeed, my friend," answered Jones, "this could not have been the
case with your poor Nancy. You have so entirely gained her affections,
that it is the loss of you, and not of her reputation, which afflicts
her, and will end in the destruction of her and her family." "Nay, for
that matter, I promise you," cries Nightingale, "she hath my
affections so absolutely, that my wife, whoever she is to be, will
have very little share in them." "And is it possible then," said
Jones, "you can think of deserting her?" "Why, what can I do?"
answered the other. "Ask Miss Nancy," replied Jones warmly. "In the
condition to which you have reduced her, I sincerely think she ought
to determine what reparation you shall make her. Her interest alone,
and not yours, ought to be your sole consideration. But if you ask me
what you shall do, what can you do less," cries Jones, "than fulfil
the expectations of her family, and her own? Nay, I sincerely tell
you, they were mine too, ever since I first saw you together. You will
pardon me if I presume on the friendship you have favoured me with,
moved as I am with compassion for those poor creatures. But your own
heart will best suggest to you, whether you have never intended, by
your conduct, to persuade the mother, as well as the daughter, into an
opinion, that you designed honourably: and if so, though there may
have been no direct promise of marriage in the case, I will leave to
your own good understanding, how far you are bound to proceed."

"Nay, I must not only confess what you have hinted," said Nightingale;
"but I am afraid even that very promise you mention I have given."
"And can you, after owning that," said Jones, "hesitate a moment?"
"Consider, my friend," answered the other; "I know you are a man of
honour, and would advise no one to act contrary to its rules; if there
were no other objection, can I, after this publication of her
disgrace, think of such an alliance with honour?" "Undoubtedly,"
replied Jones, "and the very best and truest honour, which is
goodness, requires it of you. As you mention a scruple of this kind,
you will give me leave to examine it. Can you with honour be guilty of
having under false pretences deceived a young woman and her family,
and of having by these means treacherously robbed her of her
innocence? Can you, with honour, be the knowing, the wilful occasion,
nay, the artful contriver of the ruin of a human being? Can you, with
honour, destroy the fame, the peace, nay, probably, both the life and
soul too, of this creature? Can honour bear the thought, that this
creature is a tender, helpless, defenceless, young woman? A young
woman, who loves, who doats on you, who dies for you; who hath placed
the utmost confidence in your promises; and to that confidence hath
sacrificed everything which is dear to her? Can honour support such
contemplations as these a moment?"

"Common sense, indeed," said Nightingale, "warrants all you say; but
yet you well know the opinion of the world is so contrary to it, that,
was I to marry a whore, though my own, I should be ashamed of ever
showing my face again."

"Fie upon it, Mr Nightingale!" said Jones, "do not call her by so
ungenerous a name: when you promised to marry her she became your
wife; and she hath sinned more against prudence than virtue. And what
is this world which you would be ashamed to face but the vile, the
foolish, and the profligate? Forgive me if I say such a shame must
proceed from false modesty, which always attends false honour as its
shadow.--But I am well assured there is not a man of real sense and
goodness in the world who would not honour and applaud the action.
But, admit no other would, would not your own heart, my friend,
applaud it? And do not the warm, rapturous sensations, which we feel
from the consciousness of an honest, noble, generous, benevolent
action, convey more delight to the mind than the undeserved praise of
millions? Set the alternative fairly before your eyes. On the one
side, see this poor, unhappy, tender, believing girl, in the arms of
her wretched mother, breathing her last. Hear her breaking heart in
agonies, sighing out your name; and lamenting, rather than accusing,
the cruelty which weighs her down to destruction. Paint to your
imagination the circumstances of her fond despairing parent, driven to
madness, or, perhaps, to death, by the loss of her lovely daughter.
View the poor, helpless, orphan infant; and when your mind hath dwelt
a moment only on such ideas, consider yourself as the cause of all the
ruin of this poor, little, worthy, defenceless family. On the other
side, consider yourself as relieving them from their temporary
sufferings. Think with what joy, with what transports that lovely
creature will fly to your arms. See her blood returning to her pale
cheeks, her fire to her languid eyes, and raptures to her tortured
breast. Consider the exultations of her mother, the happiness of all.
Think of this little family made by one act of yours completely happy.
Think of this alternative, and sure I am mistaken in my friend if it
requires any long deliberation whether he will sink these wretches
down for ever, or, by one generous, noble resolution, raise them all
from the brink of misery and despair to the highest pitch of human
happiness. Add to this but one consideration more; the consideration
that it is your duty so to do--That the misery from which you will
relieve these poor people is the misery which you yourself have
wilfully brought upon them."

"O, my dear friend!" cries Nightingale, "I wanted not your eloquence
to rouse me. I pity poor Nancy from my soul, and would willingly give
anything in my power that no familiarities had ever passed between us.
Nay, believe me, I had many struggles with my passion before I could
prevail with myself to write that cruel letter, which hath caused all
the misery in that unhappy family. If I had no inclinations to consult
but my own, I would marry her to-morrow morning: I would, by heaven!
but you will easily imagine how impossible it would be to prevail on
my father to consent to such a match; besides, he hath provided
another for me; and to-morrow, by his express command, I am to wait on
the lady."

"I have not the honour to know your father," said Jones; "but, suppose
he could be persuaded, would you yourself consent to the only means of
preserving these poor people?" "As eagerly as I would pursue my
happiness," answered Nightingale: "for I never shall find it in any
other woman.--O, my dear friend! could you imagine what I have felt
within these twelve hours for my poor girl, I am convinced she would
not engross all your pity. Passion leads me only to her; and, if I had
any foolish scruples of honour, you have fully satisfied them: could
my father be induced to comply with my desires, nothing would be
wanting to compleat my own happiness or that of my Nancy."

"Then I am resolved to undertake it," said Jones. "You must not be
angry with me, in whatever light it may be necessary to set this
affair, which, you may depend on it, could not otherwise be long hid
from him: for things of this nature make a quick progress when once
they get abroad, as this unhappily hath already. Besides, should any
fatal accident follow, as upon my soul I am afraid will, unless
immediately prevented, the public would ring of your name in a manner
which, if your father hath common humanity, must offend him. If you
will therefore tell me where I may find the old gentleman, I will not
lose a moment in the business; which, while I pursue, you cannot do a
more generous action than by paying a visit to the poor girl. You will
find I have not exaggerated in the account I have given of the
wretchedness of the family."

Nightingale immediately consented to the proposal; and now, having
acquainted Jones with his father's lodging, and the coffee-house where
he would most probably find him, he hesitated a moment, and then said,
"My dear Tom, you are going to undertake an impossibility. If you knew
my father you would never think of obtaining his consent.----Stay,
there is one way--suppose you told him I was already married, it might
be easier to reconcile him to the fact after it was done; and, upon my
honour, I am so affected with what you have said, and I love my Nancy
so passionately, I almost wish it was done, whatever might be the
consequence."

Jones greatly approved the hint, and promised to pursue it. They then
separated, Nightingale to visit his Nancy, and Jones in quest of the
old gentleman.



Chapter viii.

What passed between Jones and old Mr Nightingale; with the arrival of
a person not yet mentioned in this history.


Notwithstanding the sentiment of the Roman satirist, which denies the
divinity of fortune, and the opinion of Seneca to the same purpose;
Cicero, who was, I believe, a wiser man than either of them, expressly
holds the contrary; and certain it is, there are some incidents in
life so very strange and unaccountable, that it seems to require more
than human skill and foresight in producing them.

Of this kind was what now happened to Jones, who found Mr Nightingale
the elder in so critical a minute, that Fortune, if she was really
worthy all the worship she received at Rome, could not have contrived
such another. In short, the old gentleman, and the father of the young
lady whom he intended for his son, had been hard at it for many hours;
and the latter was just now gone, and had left the former delighted
with the thoughts that he had succeeded in a long contention, which
had been between the two fathers of the future bride and bridegroom;
in which both endeavoured to overreach the other, and, as it not
rarely happens in such cases, both had retreated fully satisfied of
having obtained the victory.

This gentleman, whom Mr Jones now visited, was what they call a man of
the world; that is to say, a man who directs his conduct in this world
as one who, being fully persuaded there is no other, is resolved to
make the most of this. In his early years he had been bred to trade;
but, having acquired a very good fortune, he had lately declined his
business; or, to speak more properly, had changed it from dealing in
goods, to dealing only in money, of which he had always a plentiful
fund at command, and of which he knew very well how to make a very
plentiful advantage, sometimes of the necessities of private men, and
sometimes of those of the public. He had indeed conversed so entirely
with money, that it may be almost doubted whether he imagined there
was any other thing really existing in the world; this at least may be
certainly averred, that he firmly believed nothing else to have any
real value.

The reader will, I fancy, allow that Fortune could not have culled out
a more improper person for Mr Jones to attack with any probability of
success; nor could the whimsical lady have directed this attack at a
more unseasonable time.

As money then was always uppermost in this gentleman's thoughts, so
the moment he saw a stranger within his doors it immediately occurred
to his imagination, that such stranger was either come to bring him
money, or to fetch it from him. And according as one or other of these
thoughts prevailed, he conceived a favourable or unfavourable idea of
the person who approached him.

Unluckily for Jones, the latter of these was the ascendant at present;
for as a young gentleman had visited him the day before, with a bill
from his son for a play debt, he apprehended, at the first sight of
Jones, that he was come on such another errand. Jones therefore had no
sooner told him that he was come on his son's account than the old
gentleman, being confirmed in his suspicion, burst forth into an
exclamation, "That he would lose his labour." "Is it then possible,
sir," answered Jones, "that you can guess my business?" "If I do guess
it," replied the other, "I repeat again to you, you will lose your
labour. What, I suppose you are one of those sparks who lead my son
into all those scenes of riot and debauchery, which will be his
destruction? but I shall pay no more of his bills, I promise you. I
expect he will quit all such company for the future. If I had imagined
otherwise, I should not have provided a wife for him; for I would be
instrumental in the ruin of nobody." "How, sir," said Jones, "and was
this lady of your providing?" "Pray, sir," answered the old gentleman,
"how comes it to be any concern of yours?"--"Nay, dear sir," replied
Jones, "be not offended that I interest myself in what regards your
son's happiness, for whom I have so great an honour and value. It was
upon that very account I came to wait upon you. I can't express the
satisfaction you have given me by what you say; for I do assure you
your son is a person for whom I have the highest honour.--Nay, sir, it
is not easy to express the esteem I have for you; who could be so
generous, so good, so kind, so indulgent to provide such a match for
your son; a woman, who, I dare swear, will make him one of the
happiest men upon earth."

There is scarce anything which so happily introduces men to our good
liking, as having conceived some alarm at their first appearance; when
once those apprehensions begin to vanish we soon forget the fears
which they occasioned, and look on ourselves as indebted for our
present ease to those very persons who at first raised our fears.

Thus it happened to Nightingale, who no sooner found that Jones had no
demand on him, as he suspected, than he began to be pleased with his
presence. "Pray, good sir," said he, "be pleased to sit down. I do not
remember to have ever had the pleasure of seeing you before; but if
you are a friend of my son, and have anything to say concerning this
young lady, I shall be glad to hear you. As to her making him happy,
it will be his own fault if she doth not. I have discharged my duty,
in taking care of the main article. She will bring him a fortune
capable of making any reasonable, prudent, sober man, happy."
"Undoubtedly," cries Jones, "for she is in herself a fortune; so
beautiful, so genteel, so sweet-tempered, and so well-educated; she is
indeed a most accomplished young lady; sings admirably well, and hath
a most delicate hand at the harpsichord." "I did not know any of these
matters," answered the old gentleman, "for I never saw the lady: but I
do not like her the worse for what you tell me; and I am the better
pleased with her father for not laying any stress on these
qualifications in our bargain. I shall always think it a proof of his
understanding. A silly fellow would have brought in these articles as
an addition to her fortune; but, to give him his due, he never
mentioned any such matter; though to be sure they are no
disparagements to a woman." "I do assure you, sir," cries Jones, "she
hath them all in the most eminent degree: for my part, I own I was
afraid you might have been a little backward, a little less inclined
to the match; for your son told me you had never seen the lady;
therefore I came, sir, in that case, to entreat you, to conjure you,
as you value the happiness of your son, not to be averse to his match
with a woman who hath not only all the good qualities I have
mentioned, but many more."--"If that was your business, sir," said the
old gentleman, "we are both obliged to you; and you may be perfectly
easy; for I give you my word I was very well satisfied with her
fortune." "Sir," answered Jones, "I honour you every moment more and
more. To be so easily satisfied, so very moderate on that account, is
a proof of the soundness of your understanding, as well as the
nobleness of your mind."----"Not so very moderate, young gentleman,
not so very moderate," answered the father.--"Still more and more
noble," replied Jones; "and give me leave to add, sensible: for sure
it is little less than madness to consider money as the sole
foundation of happiness. Such a woman as this with her little, her
nothing of a fortune"--"I find," cries the old gentleman, "you have a
pretty just opinion of money, my friend, or else you are better
acquainted with the person of the lady than with her circumstances.
Why, pray, what fortune do you imagine this lady to have?" "What
fortune?" cries Jones, "why, too contemptible a one to be named for
your son."--"Well, well, well," said the other, "perhaps he might have
done better."--"That I deny," said Jones, "for she is one of the best
of women."--"Ay, ay, but in point of fortune I mean," answered the
other. "And yet, as to that now, how much do you imagine your friend
is to have?"--"How much?" cries Jones, "how much? Why, at the utmost,
perhaps £200." "Do you mean to banter me, young gentleman?" said the
father, a little angry. "No, upon my soul," answered Jones, "I am in
earnest: nay, I believe I have gone to the utmost farthing. If I do
the lady an injury, I ask her pardon." "Indeed you do," cries the
father; "I am certain she hath fifty times that sum, and she shall
produce fifty to that before I consent that she shall marry my son."
"Nay," said Jones, "it is too late to talk of consent now; if she had
not fifty farthings your son is married."--"My son married!" answered
the old gentleman, with surprize. "Nay," said Jones, "I thought you
was unacquainted with it." "My son married to Miss Harris!" answered
he again. "To Miss Harris!" said Jones; "no, sir; to Miss Nancy
Miller, the daughter of Mrs Miller, at whose house he lodged; a young
lady, who, though her mother is reduced to let lodgings--"--"Are you
bantering, or are you in earnest?" cries the father, with a most
solemn voice. "Indeed, sir," answered Jones, "I scorn the character of
a banterer. I came to you in most serious earnest, imagining, as I
find true, that your son had never dared acquaint you with a match so
much inferior to him in point of fortune, though the reputation of the
lady will suffer it no longer to remain a secret."

While the father stood like one struck suddenly dumb at this news, a
gentleman came into the room, and saluted him by the name of brother.

But though these two were in consanguinity so nearly related, they
were in their dispositions almost the opposites to each other. The
brother who now arrived had likewise been bred to trade, in which he
no sooner saw himself worth £6000 than he purchased a small estate
with the greatest part of it, and retired into the country; where he
married the daughter of an unbeneficed clergyman; a young lady, who,
though she had neither beauty nor fortune, had recommended herself to
his choice entirely by her good humour, of which she possessed a very
large share.

With this woman he had, during twenty-five years, lived a life more
resembling the model which certain poets ascribe to the golden age,
than any of those patterns which are furnished by the present times.
By her he had four children, but none of them arrived at maturity,
except only one daughter, whom, in vulgar language, he and his wife
had spoiled; that is, had educated with the utmost tenderness and
fondness, which she returned to such a degree, that she had actually
refused a very extraordinary match with a gentleman a little turned of
forty, because she could not bring herself to part with her parents.

The young lady whom Mr Nightingale had intended for his son was a near
neighbour of his brother, and an acquaintance of his niece; and in
reality it was upon the account of his projected match that he was now
come to town; not, indeed, to forward, but to dissuade his brother
from a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew;
for he foresaw no other event from a union with Miss Harris,
notwithstanding the largeness of her fortune, as neither her person
nor mind seemed to him to promise any kind of matrimonial felicity:
for she was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very
silly, and very ill-natured.

His brother, therefore, no sooner mentioned the marriage of his nephew
with Miss Miller, than he exprest the utmost satisfaction; and when
the father had very bitterly reviled his son, and pronounced sentence
of beggary upon him, the uncle began in the following manner:

"If you was a little cooler, brother, I would ask you whether you love
your son for his sake or for your own. You would answer, I suppose,
and so I suppose you think, for his sake; and doubtless it is his
happiness which you intended in the marriage you proposed for him.

"Now, brother, to prescribe rules of happiness to others hath always
appeared to me very absurd, and to insist on doing this, very
tyrannical. It is a vulgar error, I know; but it is, nevertheless, an
error. And if this be absurd in other things, it is mostly so in the
affair of marriage, the happiness of which depends entirely on the
affection which subsists between the parties.

"I have therefore always thought it unreasonable in parents to desire
to chuse for their children on this occasion; since to force affection
is an impossible attempt; nay, so much doth love abhor force, that I
know not whether, through an unfortunate but uncurable perverseness in
our natures, it may not be even impatient of persuasion.

"It is, however, true that, though a parent will not, I think, wisely
prescribe, he ought to be consulted on this occasion; and, in
strictness, perhaps, should at least have a negative voice. My nephew,
therefore, I own, in marrying, without asking your advice, hath been
guilty of a fault. But, honestly speaking, brother, have you not a
little promoted this fault? Have not your frequent declarations on
this subject given him a moral certainty of your refusal, where there
was any deficiency in point of fortune? Nay, doth not your present
anger arise solely from that deficiency? And if he hath failed in his
duty here, did you not as much exceed that authority when you
absolutely bargained with him for a woman, without his knowledge, whom
you yourself never saw, and whom, if you had seen and known as well as
I, it must have been madness in you to have ever thought of bringing
her into your family?

"Still I own my nephew in a fault; but surely it is not an
unpardonable fault. He hath acted indeed without your consent, in a
matter in which he ought to have asked it, but it is in a matter in
which his interest is principally concerned; you yourself must and
will acknowledge that you consulted his interest only, and if he
unfortunately differed from you, and hath been mistaken in his notion
of happiness, will you, brother, if you love your son, carry him still
wider from the point? Will you increase the ill consequences of his
simple choice? Will you endeavour to make an event certain misery to
him, which may accidentally prove so? In a word, brother, because he
hath put it out of your power to make his circumstances as affluent as
you would, will you distress them as much as you can?"

By the force of the true Catholic faith St Anthony won upon the
fishes. Orpheus and Amphion went a little farther, and by the charms
of music enchanted things merely inanimate. Wonderful, both! but
neither history nor fable have ever yet ventured to record an instance
of any one, who, by force of argument and reason, hath triumphed over
habitual avarice.

Mr Nightingale, the father, instead of attempting to answer his
brother, contented himself with only observing, that they had always
differed in their sentiments concerning the education of their
children. "I wish," said he, "brother, you would have confined your
care to your own daughter, and never have troubled yourself with my
son, who hath, I believe, as little profited by your precepts, as by
your example." For young Nightingale was his uncle's godson, and had
lived more with him than with his father. So that the uncle had often
declared he loved his nephew almost equally with his own child.

Jones fell into raptures with this good gentleman; and when, after
much persuasion, they found the father grew still more and more
irritated, instead of appeased, Jones conducted the uncle to his
nephew at the house of Mrs Miller.



Chapter ix.

Containing strange matters.


At his return to his lodgings, Jones found the situation of affairs
greatly altered from what they had been in at his departure. The
mother, the two daughters, and young Mr Nightingale, were now sat down
to supper together, when the uncle was, at his own desire, introduced
without any ceremony into the company, to all of whom he was well
known; for he had several times visited his nephew at that house.

The old gentleman immediately walked up to Miss Nancy, saluted and
wished her joy, as he did afterwards the mother and the other sister;
and lastly, he paid the proper compliments to his nephew, with the
same good humour and courtesy, as if his nephew had married his equal
or superior in fortune, with all the previous requisites first
performed.

Miss Nancy and her supposed husband both turned pale, and looked
rather foolish than otherwise upon the occasion; but Mrs Miller took
the first opportunity of withdrawing; and, having sent for Jones into
the dining-room, she threw herself at his feet, and in a most
passionate flood of tears, called him her good angel, the preserver of
her poor little family, with many other respectful and endearing
appellations, and made him every acknowledgment which the highest
benefit can extract from the most grateful heart.

After the first gust of her passion was a little over, which she
declared, if she had not vented, would have burst her, she proceeded
to inform Mr Jones that all matters were settled between Mr
Nightingale and her daughter, and that they were to be married the
next morning; at which Mr Jones having expressed much pleasure, the
poor woman fell again into a fit of joy and thanksgiving, which he at
length with difficulty silenced, and prevailed on her to return with
him back to the company, whom they found in the same good humour in
which they had left them.

This little society now past two or three very agreeable hours
together, in which the uncle, who was a very great lover of his
bottle, had so well plyed his nephew, that this latter, though not
drunk, began to be somewhat flustered; and now Mr Nightingale, taking
the old gentleman with him upstairs into the apartment he had lately
occupied, unbosomed himself as follows:--

"As you have been always the best and kindest of uncles to me, and as
you have shown such unparalleled goodness in forgiving this match,
which to be sure may be thought a little improvident, I should never
forgive myself if I attempted to deceive you in anything." He then
confessed the truth, and opened the whole affair.

"How, Jack?" said the old gentleman, "and are you really then not
married to this young woman?" "No, upon my honour," answered
Nightingale, "I have told you the simple truth." "My dear boy," cries
the uncle, kissing him, "I am heartily glad to hear it. I never was
better pleased in my life. If you had been married I should have
assisted you as much as was in my power to have made the best of a bad
matter; but there is a great difference between considering a thing
which is already done and irrecoverable, and that which is yet to do.
Let your reason have fair play, Jack, and you will see this match in
so foolish and preposterous a light, that there will be no need of any
dissuasive arguments." "How, sir?" replies young Nightingale, "is
there this difference between having already done an act, and being in
honour engaged to do it?" "Pugh!" said the uncle, "honour is a
creature of the world's making, and the world hath the power of a
creator over it, and may govern and direct it as they please. Now you
well know how trivial these breaches of contract are thought; even the
grossest make but the wonder and conversation of a day. Is there a man
who afterwards will be more backward in giving you his sister, or
daughter? or is there any sister or daughter who would be more
backward to receive you? Honour is not concerned in these
engagements." "Pardon me, dear sir," cries Nightingale, "I can never
think so; and not only honour, but conscience and humanity, are
concerned. I am well satisfied, that, was I now to disappoint the
young creature, her death would be the consequence, and I should look
upon myself as her murderer; nay, as her murderer by the cruellest of
all methods, by breaking her heart." "Break her heart, indeed! no, no,
Jack," cries the uncle, "the hearts of women are not so soon broke;
they are tough, boy, they are tough." "But, sir," answered
Nightingale, "my own affections are engaged, and I never could be
happy with any other woman. How often have I heard you say, that
children should be always suffered to chuse for themselves, and that
you would let my cousin Harriet do so?" "Why, ay," replied the old
gentleman, "so I would have them; but then I would have them chuse
wisely.--Indeed, Jack, you must and shall leave the girl."----"Indeed,
uncle," cries the other, "I must and will have her." "You will, young
gentleman;" said the uncle; "I did not expect such a word from you. I
should not wonder if you had used such language to your father, who
hath always treated you like a dog, and kept you at the distance which
a tyrant preserves over his subjects; but I, who have lived with you
upon an equal footing, might surely expect better usage: but I know
how to account for it all: it is all owing to your preposterous
education, in which I have had too little share. There is my daughter,
now, whom I have brought up as my friend, never doth anything without
my advice, nor ever refuses to take it when I give it her." "You have
never yet given her advice in an affair of this kind," said
Nightingale; "for I am greatly mistaken in my cousin, if she would be
very ready to obey even your most positive commands in abandoning her
inclinations." "Don't abuse my girl," answered the old gentleman with
some emotion; "don't abuse my Harriet. I have brought her up to have
no inclinations contrary to my own. By suffering her to do whatever
she pleases, I have enured her to a habit of being pleased to do
whatever I like." "Pardon, me, sir," said Nightingale, "I have not the
least design to reflect on my cousin, for whom I have the greatest
esteem; and indeed I am convinced you will never put her to so severe
a tryal, or lay such hard commands on her as you would do on me.--But,
dear sir, let us return to the company; for they will begin to be
uneasy at our long absence. I must beg one favour of my dear uncle,
which is that he would not say anything to shock the poor girl or her
mother." "Oh! you need not fear me," answered he, "I understand myself
too well to affront women; so I will readily grant you that favour;
and in return I must expect another of you." "There are but few of
your commands, sir," said Nightingale, "which I shall not very
chearfully obey." "Nay, sir, I ask nothing," said the uncle, "but the
honour of your company home to my lodging, that I may reason the case
a little more fully with you; for I would, if possible, have the
satisfaction of preserving my family, notwithstanding the headstrong
folly of my brother, who, in his own opinion, is the wisest man in the
world."

Nightingale, who well knew his uncle to be as headstrong as his
father, submitted to attend him home, and then they both returned back
into the room, where the old gentleman promised to carry himself with
the same decorum which he had before maintained.



Chapter x.

A short chapter, which concludes the book.


The long absence of the uncle and nephew had occasioned some disquiet
in the minds of all whom they had left behind them; and the more, as,
during the preceding dialogue, the uncle had more than once elevated
his voice, so as to be heard downstairs; which, though they could not
distinguish what he said, had caused some evil foreboding in Nancy and
her mother, and, indeed, even in Jones himself.

When the good company, therefore, again assembled, there was a visible
alteration in all their faces; and the good-humour which, at their
last meeting, universally shone forth in every countenance, was now
changed into a much less agreeable aspect. It was a change, indeed,
common enough to the weather in this climate, from sunshine to clouds,
from June to December.

This alteration was not, however, greatly remarked by any present; for
as they were all now endeavouring to conceal their own thoughts, and
to act a part, they became all too busily engaged in the scene to be
spectators of it. Thus neither the uncle nor nephew saw any symptoms
of suspicion in the mother or daughter; nor did the mother or daughter
remark the overacted complacence of the old man, nor the counterfeit
satisfaction which grinned in the features of the young one.

Something like this, I believe, frequently happens, where the whole
attention of two friends being engaged in the part which each is to
act, in order to impose on the other, neither sees nor suspects the
arts practised against himself; and thus the thrust of both (to borrow
no improper metaphor on the occasion) alike takes place.

From the same reason it is no unusual thing for both parties to be
overreached in a bargain, though the one must be always the greater
loser; as was he who sold a blind horse, and received a bad note in
payment.

Our company in about half an hour broke up, and the uncle carried off
his nephew; but not before the latter had assured Miss Nancy, in a
whisper, that he would attend her early in the morning, and fulfil all
his engagements.

Jones, who was the least concerned in this scene, saw the most. He did
indeed suspect the very fact; for, besides observing the great
alteration in the behaviour of the uncle, the distance he assumed, and
his overstrained civility to Miss Nancy; the carrying off a bridegroom
from his bride at that time of night was so extraordinary a proceeding
that it could be accounted for only by imagining that young
Nightingale had revealed the whole truth, which the apparent openness
of his temper, and his being flustered with liquor, made too probable.

While he was reasoning with himself, whether he should acquaint these
poor people with his suspicion, the maid of the house informed him
that a gentlewoman desired to speak with him.----He went immediately
out, and, taking the candle from the maid, ushered his visitant
upstairs, who, in the person of Mrs Honour, acquainted him with such
dreadful news concerning his Sophia, that he immediately lost all
consideration for every other person; and his whole stock of
compassion was entirely swallowed up in reflections on his own misery,
and on that of his unfortunate angel.

What this dreadful matter was, the reader will be informed, after we
have first related the many preceding steps which produced it, and
those will be the subject of the following book.




BOOK XV.

IN WHICH THE HISTORY ADVANCES ABOUT TWO DAYS.



Chapter i.

Too short to need a preface.


There are a set of religious, or rather moral writers, who teach that
virtue is the certain road to happiness, and vice to misery, in this
world. A very wholesome and comfortable doctrine, and to which we have
but one objection, namely, that it is not true.

Indeed, if by virtue these writers mean the exercise of those cardinal
virtues, which like good housewives stay at home, and mind only the
business of their own family, I shall very readily concede the point;
for so surely do all these contribute and lead to happiness, that I
could almost wish, in violation of all the antient and modern sages,
to call them rather by the name of wisdom, than by that of virtue;
for, with regard to this life, no system, I conceive, was ever wiser
than that of the antient Epicureans, who held this wisdom to
constitute the chief good; nor foolisher than that of their opposites,
those modern epicures, who place all felicity in the abundant
gratification of every sensual appetite.

But if by virtue is meant (as I almost think it ought) a certain
relative quality, which is always busying itself without-doors, and
seems as much interested in pursuing the good of others as its own; I
cannot so easily agree that this is the surest way to human happiness;
because I am afraid we must then include poverty and contempt, with
all the mischiefs which backbiting, envy, and ingratitude, can bring
on mankind, in our idea of happiness; nay, sometimes perhaps we shall
be obliged to wait upon the said happiness to a jail; since many by
the above virtue have brought themselves thither.

I have not now leisure to enter upon so large a field of speculation,
as here seems opening upon me; my design was to wipe off a doctrine
that lay in my way; since, while Mr Jones was acting the most virtuous
part imaginable in labouring to preserve his fellow-creatures from
destruction, the devil, or some other evil spirit, one perhaps
cloathed in human flesh, was hard at work to make him completely
miserable in the ruin of his Sophia.

This therefore would seem an exception to the above rule, if indeed it
was a rule; but as we have in our voyage through life seen so many
other exceptions to it, we chuse to dispute the doctrine on which it
is founded, which we don't apprehend to be Christian, which we are
convinced is not true, and which is indeed destructive of one of the
noblest arguments that reason alone can furnish for the belief of
immortality.

But as the reader's curiosity (if he hath any) must be now awake, and
hungry, we shall provide to feed it as fast as we can.



Chapter ii.

In which is opened a very black design against Sophia.


I remember a wise old gentleman who used to say, "When children are
doing nothing, they are doing mischief." I will not enlarge this
quaint saying to the most beautiful part of the creation in general;
but so far I may be allowed, that when the effects of female jealousy
do not appear openly in their proper colours of rage and fury, we may
suspect that mischievous passion to be at work privately, and
attempting to undermine, what it doth not attack above-ground.

This was exemplified in the conduct of Lady Bellaston, who, under all
the smiles which she wore in her countenance, concealed much
indignation against Sophia; and as she plainly saw that this young
lady stood between her and the full indulgence of her desires, she
resolved to get rid of her by some means or other; nor was it long
before a very favourable opportunity of accomplishing this presented
itself to her.

The reader may be pleased to remember, that when Sophia was thrown
into that consternation at the playhouse, by the wit and humour of a
set of young gentlemen who call themselves the town, we informed him,
that she had put herself under the protection of a young nobleman, who
had very safely conducted her to her chair.

This nobleman, who frequently visited Lady Bellaston, had more than
once seen Sophia there, since her arrival in town, and had conceived a
very great liking to her; which liking, as beauty never looks more
amiable than in distress, Sophia had in this fright so encreased, that
he might now, without any great impropriety, be said to be actually in
love with her.

It may easily be believed, that he would not suffer so handsome an
occasion of improving his acquaintance with the beloved object as now
offered itself to elapse, when even good breeding alone might have
prompted him to pay her a visit.

The next morning therefore, after this accident, he waited on Sophia,
with the usual compliments, and hopes that she had received no harm
from her last night's adventure.

As love, like fire, when once thoroughly kindled, is soon blown into a
flame, Sophia in a very short time compleated her conquest. Time now
flew away unperceived, and the noble lord had been two hours in
company with the lady, before it entered into his head that he had
made too long a visit. Though this circumstance alone would have
alarmed Sophia, who was somewhat more a mistress of computation at
present; she had indeed much more pregnant evidence from the eyes of
her lover of what past within his bosom; nay, though he did not make
any open declaration of his passion, yet many of his expressions were
rather too warm, and too tender, to have been imputed to complacence,
even in the age when such complacence was in fashion; the very reverse
of which is well known to be the reigning mode at present.

Lady Bellaston had been apprized of his lordship's visit at his first
arrival; and the length of it very well satisfied her, that things
went as she wished, and as indeed she had suspected the second time
she saw this young couple together. This business, she rightly I think
concluded, that she should by no means forward by mixing in the
company while they were together; she therefore ordered her servants,
that when my lord was going, they should tell him she desired to speak
with him; and employed the intermediate time in meditating how best to
accomplish a scheme, which she made no doubt but his lordship would
very readily embrace the execution of.

Lord Fellamar (for that was the title of this young nobleman) was no
sooner introduced to her ladyship, than she attacked him in the
following strain: "Bless me, my lord, are you here yet? I thought my
servants had made a mistake, and let you go away; and I wanted to see
you about an affair of some importance."----"Indeed, Lady Bellaston,"
said he, "I don't wonder you are astonished at the length of my
visit; for I have staid above two hours, and I did not think I had
staid above half-a-one."----"What am I to conclude from thence, my
lord?" said she. "The company must be very agreeable which can make
time slide away so very deceitfully."----"Upon my honour," said he,
"the most agreeable I ever saw. Pray tell me, Lady Bellaston, who is
this blazing star which you have produced among us all of a
sudden?"----"What blazing star, my lord?" said she, affecting a
surprize. "I mean," said he, "the lady I saw here the other day, whom
I had last night in my arms at the playhouse, and to whom I have been
making that unreasonable visit."----"O, my cousin Western!" said she;
"why, that blazing star, my lord, is the daughter of a country booby
squire, and hath been in town about a fortnight, for the first
time."----"Upon my soul," said he, "I should swear she had been bred
up in a court; for besides her beauty, I never saw anything so
genteel, so sensible, so polite."----"O brave!" cries the lady, "my
cousin hath you, I find."----"Upon my honour," answered he, "I wish
she had; for I am in love with her to distraction."----"Nay, my
lord," said she, "it is not wishing yourself very ill neither, for
she is a very great fortune: I assure you she is an only child, and
her father's estate is a good £3000 a-year." "Then I can assure you,
madam," answered the lord, "I think her the best match in England."
"Indeed, my lord," replied she, "if you like her, I heartily wish you
had her." "If you think so kindly of me, madam," said he, "as she is
a relation of yours, will you do me the honour to propose it to her
father?" "And are you really then in earnest?" cries the lady, with
an affected gravity. "I hope, madam," answered he, "you have a better
opinion of me, than to imagine I would jest with your ladyship in an
affair of this kind." "Indeed, then," said the lady, "I will most
readily propose your lordship to her father; and I can, I believe,
assure you of his joyful acceptance of the proposal; but there is a
bar, which I am almost ashamed to mention; and yet it is one you will
never be able to conquer. You have a rival, my lord, and a rival who,
though I blush to name him, neither you, nor all the world, will ever
be able to conquer." "Upon my word, Lady Bellaston," cries he, "you
have struck a damp to my heart, which hath almost deprived me of
being." "Fie, my lord," said she, "I should rather hope I had struck
fire into you. A lover, and talk of damps in your heart! I rather
imagined you would have asked your rival's name, that you might have
immediately entered the lists with him." "I promise you, madam,"
answered he, "there are very few things I would not undertake for
your charming cousin; but pray, who is this happy man?"--"Why, he
is," said she, "what I am sorry to say most happy men with us are,
one of the lowest fellows in the world. He is a beggar, a bastard, a
foundling, a fellow in meaner circumstances than one of your
lordship's footmen." "And is it possible," cried he, "that a young
creature with such perfections should think of bestowing herself so
unworthily?" "Alas! my lord," answered she, "consider the
country--the bane of all young women is the country. There they learn
a set of romantic notions of love, and I know not what folly, which
this town and good company can scarce eradicate in a whole winter."
"Indeed, madam," replied my lord, "your cousin is of too immense a
value to be thrown away; such ruin as this must be prevented."
"Alas!" cries she, "my lord, how can it be prevented? The family have
already done all in their power; but the girl is, I think,
intoxicated, and nothing less than ruin will content her. And to deal
more openly with you, I expect every day to hear she is run away with
him." "What you tell me, Lady Bellaston," answered his lordship,
"affects me most tenderly, and only raises my compassion, instead of
lessening my adoration of your cousin. Some means must be found to
preserve so inestimable a jewel. Hath your ladyship endeavoured to
reason with her?" Here the lady affected a laugh, and cried, "My dear
lord, sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young woman
out of her inclinations? These inestimable jewels are as deaf as the
jewels they wear: time, my lord, time is the only medicine to cure
their folly; but this is a medicine which I am certain she will not
take; nay, I live in hourly horrors on her account. In short, nothing
but violent methods will do." "What is to be done?" cries my lord;
"what methods are to be taken?--Is there any method upon earth?--Oh!
Lady Bellaston! there is nothing which I would not undertake for such
a reward."----"I really know not," answered the lady, after a pause;
and then pausing again, she cried out--"Upon my soul, I am at my
wit's end on this girl's account.--If she can be preserved, something
must be done immediately; and, as I say, nothing but violent methods
will do.----If your lordship hath really this attachment to my cousin
(and to do her justice, except in this silly inclination, of which
she will soon see her folly, she is every way deserving), I think
there may be one way, indeed, it is a very disagreeable one, and what
I am almost afraid to think of.--It requires a great spirit, I
promise you." "I am not conscious, madam," said he, "of any defect
there; nor am I, I hope, suspected of any such. It must be an
egregious defect indeed, which could make me backward on this
occasion." "Nay, my lord," answered she, "I am so far from doubting
you, I am much more inclined to doubt my own courage; for I must run
a monstrous risque. In short, I must place such a confidence in your
honour as a wise woman will scarce ever place in a man on any
consideration." In this point likewise my lord very well satisfied
her; for his reputation was extremely clear, and common fame did him
no more than justice, in speaking well of him. "Well, then," said
she, "my lord,--I--I vow, I can't bear the apprehension of it.--No,
it must not be.----At least every other method shall be tried. Can
you get rid of your engagements, and dine here to-day? Your lordship
will have an opportunity of seeing a little more of Miss Western.--I
promise you we have no time to lose. Here will be nobody but Lady
Betty, and Miss Eagle, and Colonel Hampsted, and Tom Edwards; they
will all go soon--and I shall be at home to nobody. Then your
lordship may be a little more explicit. Nay, I will contrive some
method to convince you of her attachment to this fellow." My lord
made proper compliments, accepted the invitation, and then they
parted to dress, it being now past three in the morning, or to reckon
by the old style, in the afternoon.



Chapter iii.

A further explanation of the foregoing design.


Though the reader may have long since concluded Lady Bellaston to be a
member (and no inconsiderable one) of the great world; she was in
reality a very considerable member of the little world; by which
appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable society
which not long since flourished in this kingdom.

Among other good principles upon which this society was founded, there
was one very remarkable; for, as it was a rule of an honourable club
of heroes, who assembled at the close of the late war, that all the
members should every day fight once at least; so 'twas in this, that
every member should, within the twenty-four hours, tell at least one
merry fib, which was to be propagated by all the brethren and
sisterhood.

Many idle stories were told about this society, which from a certain
quality may be, perhaps not unjustly, supposed to have come from the
society themselves. As, that the devil was the president; and that he
sat in person in an elbow-chair at the upper end of the table; but,
upon very strict enquiry, I find there is not the least truth in any
of those tales, and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of
very good sort of people, and the fibs which they propagated were of a
harmless kind, and tended only to produce mirth and good humour.

Edwards was likewise a member of this comical society. To him
therefore Lady Bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her
purpose, and furnished him with a fib, which he was to vent whenever
the lady gave him her cue; and this was not to be till the evening,
when all the company but Lord Fellamar and himself were gone, and
while they were engaged in a rubber at whist.

To this time then, which was between seven and eight in the evening,
we will convey our reader; when Lady Bellaston, Lord Fellamar, Miss
Western, and Tom, being engaged at whist, and in the last game of
their rubbers, Tom received his cue from Lady Bellaston, which was, "I
protest, Tom, you are grown intolerable lately; you used to tell us
all the news of the town, and now you know no more of the world than
if you lived out of it."

Mr Edwards then began as follows: "The fault is not mine, madam: it
lies in the dulness of the age, that doth nothing worth talking
of.----O la! though now I think on't there hath a terrible accident
befallen poor Colonel Wilcox.----Poor Ned.----You know him, my lord,
everybody knows him; faith! I am very much concerned for him."

"What is it, pray?" says Lady Bellaston.

"Why, he hath killed a man this morning in a duel, that's all."

His lordship, who was not in the secret, asked gravely, whom he had
killed? To which Edwards answered, "A young fellow we none of us know;
a Somersetshire lad just came to town, one Jones his name is; a near
relation of one Mr Allworthy, of whom your lordship I believe hath
heard. I saw the lad lie dead in a coffee-house.--Upon my soul, he is
one of the finest corpses I ever saw in my life!"

Sophia, who had just began to deal as Tom had mentioned that a man was
killed, stopt her hand, and listened with attention (for all stories
of that kind affected her), but no sooner had he arrived at the latter
part of the story than she began to deal again; and having dealt three
cards to one, and seven to another, and ten to a third, at last dropt
the rest from her hand, and fell back in her chair.

The company behaved as usually on these occasions. The usual
disturbance ensued, the usual assistance was summoned, and Sophia at
last, as it is usual, returned again to life, and was soon after, at
her earnest desire, led to her own apartment; where, at my lord's
request, Lady Bellaston acquainted her with the truth, attempted to
carry it off as a jest of her own, and comforted her with repeated
assurances, that neither his lordship nor Tom, though she had taught
him the story, were in the true secret of the affair.

There was no farther evidence necessary to convince Lord Fellamar how
justly the case had been represented to him by Lady Bellaston; and
now, at her return into the room, a scheme was laid between these two
noble per and
six at your command. I promised Allworthy already to give up half my
estate--od rabbet it! I should hardly stick at giving up the whole."
"Will my papa be so kind," says she, "as to hear me speak?"--"Why wout
ask, Sophy?" cries he, "when dost know I had rather hear thy voice
than the musick of the best pack of dogs in England.--Hear thee, my
dear little girl! I hope I shall hear thee as long as I live; for if I
was ever to lose that pleasure, I would not gee a brass varden to live
a moment longer. Indeed, Sophy, you do not know how I love you, indeed
you don't, or you never could have run away and left your poor father,
who hath no other joy, no other comfort upon earth, but his little
Sophy." At these words the tears stood in his eyes; and Sophia (with
the tears streaming from hers) answered, "Indeed, my dear papa, I know
you have loved me tenderly, and heaven is my witness how sincerely I
have returned your affection; nor could anything but an apprehension
of being forced into the arms of this man have driven me to run from a
father whom I love so passionately, that I would, with pleasure,
sacrifice my life to his happiness; nay, I have endeavoured to reason
myself into doing more, and had almost worked up a resolution to
endure the most miserable of all lives, to comply with your
inclination. It was that resolution alone to which I could not force
my mind; nor can I ever." Here the squire began to look wild, and the
foam appeared at his lips, which Sophia, observing, begged to be heard
out, and then proceeded: "If my father's life, his health, or any real
happiness of his was at stake, here stands your resolved daughter; may
heaven blast me if there is a misery I would not suffer to preserve
you!--No, that most detested, most loathsome of all lots would I
embrace. I would give my hand to Blifil for your sake."--"I tell thee,
it will preserve me," answers the father; "it will give me health,
happiness, life, everything.--Upon my soul I shall die if dost refuse
me; I shall break my heart, I shall, upon my soul."--"Is it possible,"
says she, "you can have such a desire to make me miserable?"--"I tell
thee noa," answered he loudly, "d--n me if there is a thing upon earth
I would not do to see thee happy."--"And will not my dear papa allow
me to have the least knowledge of what will make me so? If it be true
that happiness consists in opinion, what must be my condition, when I
shall think myself the most miserable of all the wretches upon earth?"
"Better think yourself so," said he, "than know it by being married to
a poor bastardly vagabond." "If it will content you, sir," said
Sophia, "I will give you the most solemn promise never to marry him,
nor any other, while my papa lives, without his consent. Let me
dedicate my whole life to your service; let me be again your poor
Sophy, and my whole business and pleasure be, as it hath been, to
please and divert you." "Lookee, Sophy," answered the squire, "I am
not to be choused in this manner. Your aunt Western would then have
reason to think me the fool she doth. No, no, Sophy, I'd have you to
know I have a got more wisdom, and know more of the world, than to
take the word of a woman in a matter where a man is concerned." "How,
sir, have I deserved this want of confidence?" said she; "have I ever
broke a single promise to you? or have I ever been found guilty of a
falsehood from my cradle?" "Lookee, Sophy," cries he; "that's neither
here nor there. I am determined upon this match, and have him you
shall, d--n me if shat unt. D--n me if shat unt, though dost hang
thyself the next morning." At repeating which words he clinched his
fist, knit his brows, bit his lips, and thundered so loud, that the
poor afflicted, terrified Sophia sunk trembling into her chair, and,
had not a flood of tears come immediately to her relief, perhaps worse
had followed.

Western beheld the deplorable condition of his daughter with no more
contrition or remorse than the turnkey of Newgate feels at viewing the
agonies of a tender wife, when taking her last farewel of her
condemned husband; or rather he looked down on her with the same
emotions which arise in an honest fair tradesman, who sees his debtor
dragged to prison for £10, which, though a just debt, the wretch is
wickedly unable to pay. Or, to hit the case still more nearly, he felt
the same compunction with a bawd, when some poor innocent, whom she
hath ensnared into her hands, falls into fits at the first proposal of
what is called seeing company. Indeed this resemblance would be exact,
was it not that the bawd hath an interest in what she doth, and the
father, though perhaps he may blindly think otherwise, can, in
reality, have none in urging his daughter to almost an equal
prostitution.

In this condition he left his poor Sophia, and, departing with a very
vulgar observation on the effect of tears, he locked the room, and
returned to the parson, who said everything he durst in behalf of the
young lady, which, though perhaps it was not quite so much as his duty
required, yet was it sufficient to throw the squire into a violent
rage, and into many indecent reflections on the whole body of the
clergy, which we have too great an honour for that sacred function to
commit to paper.



Chapter iii.

What happened to Sophia during her confinement.


The landlady of the house where the squire lodged had begun very early
to entertain a strange opinion of her guests. However, as she was
informed that the squire was a man of vast fortune, and as she had
taken care to exact a very extraordinary price for her rooms, she did
not think proper to give any offence; for, though she was not without
some concern for the confinement of poor Sophia, of whose great
sweetness of temper and affability the maid of the house had made so
favourable a report, which was confirmed by all the squire's servants,
yet she had much more concern for her own interest than to provoke
one, whom, as she said, she perceived to be a very hastish kind of a
gentleman.

Though Sophia eat but little, yet she was regularly served with her
meals; indeed, I believe, if she had liked any one rarity, that the
squire, however angry, would have spared neither pains nor cost to
have procured it for her; since, however strange it may appear to some
of my readers, he really doated on his daughter, and to give her any
kind of pleasure was the highest satisfaction of his life.

The dinner-hour being arrived, Black George carried her up a pullet,
the squire himself (for he had sworn not to part with the key)
attending the door. As George deposited the dish, some compliments
passed between him and Sophia (for he had not seen her since she left
the country, and she treated every servant with more respect than some
persons shew to those who are in a very slight degree their
inferiors). Sophia would have had him take the pullet back, saying,
she could not eat; but George begged her to try, and particularly
recommended to her the eggs, of which he said it was full.

All this time the squire was waiting at the door; but George was a
great favourite with his master, as his employment was in concerns of
the highest nature, namely, about the game, and was accustomed to take
many liberties. He had officiously carried up the dinner, being, as he
said, very desirous to see his young lady; he made therefore no
scruple of keeping his master standing above ten minutes, while
civilities were passing between him and Sophia, for which he received
only a good-humoured rebuke at the door when he returned.

The eggs of pullets, partridges, pheasants, &c., were, as George well
knew, the most favourite dainties of Sophia. It was therefore no
wonder that he, who was a very good-natured fellow, should take care
to supply her with this kind of delicacy, at a time when all the
servants in the house were afraid she would be starved; for she had
scarce swallowed a single morsel in the last forty hours.

Though vexation hath not the same effect on all persons as it usually
hath on a widow, whose appetite it often renders sharper than it can
be rendered by the air on Bansted Downs, or Salisbury Plain; yet the
sublimest grief, notwithstanding what some people may say to the
contrary, will eat at last. And Sophia, herself, after some little
consideration, began to dissect the fowl, which she found to be as
full of eggs as George had reported it.

But, if she was pleased with these, it contained something which would
have delighted the Royal Society much more; for if a fowl with three
legs be so invaluable a curiosity, when perhaps time hath produced a
thousand such, at what price shall we esteem a bird which so totally
contradicts all the laws of animal oeconomy, as to contain a letter in
its belly? Ovid tells us of a flower into which Hyacinthus was
metamorphosed, that bears letters on its leaves, which Virgil
recommended as a miracle to the Royal Society of his day; but no age
nor nation hath ever recorded a bird with a letter in its maw.

But though a miracle of this kind might have engaged all the
_Académies des Sciences_ in Europe, and perhaps in a fruitless
enquiry; yet the reader, by barely recollecting the last dialogue
which passed between Messieurs Jones and Partridge, will be very
easily satisfied from whence this letter came, and how it found its
passage into the fowl.

Sophia, notwithstanding her long fast, and notwithstanding her
favourite dish was there before her, no sooner saw the letter than she
immediately snatched it up, tore it open, and read as follows:--

  "MADAM,

  "Was I not sensible to whom I have the honour of writing, I should
  endeavour, however difficult, to paint the horrors of my mind at the
  account brought me by Mrs Honour; but as tenderness alone can have
  any true idea of the pangs which tenderness is capable of feeling,
  so can this most amiable quality, which my Sophia possesses in the
  most eminent degree, sufficiently inform her what her Jones must
  have suffered on this melancholy occasion. Is there a circumstance
  in the world which can heighten my agonies, when I hear of any
  misfortune which hath befallen you? Surely there is one only, and
  with that I am accursed. It is, my Sophia, the dreadful
  consideration that I am myself the wretched cause. Perhaps I here do
  myself too much honour, but none will envy me an honour which costs
  me so extremely dear. Pardon me this presumption, and pardon me a
  greater still, if I ask you, whether my advice, my assistance, my
  presence, my absence, my death, or my tortures can bring you any
  relief? Can the most perfect admiration, the most watchful
  observance, the most ardent love, the most melting tenderness, the
  most resigned submission to your will, make you amends for what you
  are to sacrifice to my happiness? If they can, fly, my lovely angel,
  to those arms which are ever open to receive and protect you; and to
  which, whether you bring yourself alone, or the riches of the world
  with you, is, in my opinion, an alternative not worth regarding. If,
  on the contrary, wisdom shall predominate, and, on the most mature
  reflection, inform you, that the sacrifice is too great; and if
  there be no way left to reconcile your father, and restore the peace
  of your dear mind, but by abandoning me, I conjure you drive me for
  ever from your thoughts, exert your resolution, and let no
  compassion for my sufferings bear the least weight in that tender
  bosom. Believe me, madam, I so sincerely love you better than
  myself, that my great and principal end is your happiness. My first
  wish (why would not fortune indulge me in it?) was, and pardon me if
  I say, still is, to see you every moment the happiest of women; my
  second wish is, to hear you are so; but no misery on earth can equal
  mine, while I think you owe an uneasy moment to him who is,

         Madam,
             in every sense, and to every purpose,
                    your devoted,
                          THOMAS JONES."

What Sophia said, or did, or thought, upon this letter, how often she
read it, or whether more than once, shall all be left to our reader's
imagination. The answer to it he may perhaps see hereafter, but not at
present: for this reason, among others, that she did not now write
any, and that for several good causes, one of which was this, she had
no paper, pen, nor ink.

In the evening, while Sophia was meditating on the letter she had
received, or on something else, a violent noise from below disturbed
her meditations. This noise was no other than a round bout at
altercation between two persons. One of the combatants, by his voice,
she immediately distinguished to be her father; but she did not so
soon discover the shriller pipes to belong to the organ of her aunt
Western, who was just arrived in town, where having, by means of one
of her servants, who stopt at the Hercules Pillars, learned where her
brother lodged, she drove directly to his lodgings.

We shall therefore take our leave at present of Sophia, and, with our
usual good-breeding, attend her ladyship.



Chapter iv.

In which Sophia is delivered from her confinement.


The squire and the parson (for the landlord was now otherwise engaged)
were smoaking their pipes together, when the arrival of the lady was
first signified. The squire no sooner heard her name, than he
immediately ran down to usher her upstairs; for he was a great
observer of such ceremonials, especially to his sister, of whom he
stood more in awe than of any other human creature, though he never
would own this, nor did he perhaps know it himself.

Mrs Western, on her arrival in the dining-room, having flung herself
into a chair, began thus to harangue: "Well, surely, no one ever had
such an intolerable journey. I think the roads, since so many turnpike
acts, are grown worse than ever. La, brother, how could you get into
this odious place? no person of condition, I dare swear, ever set foot
here before." "I don't know," cries the squire, "I think they do well
enough; it was landlord recommended them. I thought, as he knew most
of the quality, he could best shew me where to get among um." "Well,
and where's my niece?" says the lady; "have you been to wait upon Lady
Bellaston yet?" "Ay, ay," cries the squire, "your niece is safe
enough; she is upstairs in chamber." "How!" answered the lady, "is my
niece in this house, and does she not know of my being here?" "No,
nobody can well get to her," says the squire, "for she is under lock
and key. I have her safe; I vetched her from my lady cousin the first
night I came to town, and I have taken care o' her ever since; she is
as secure as a fox in a bag, I promise you." "Good heaven!" returned
Mrs Western, "what do I hear? I thought what a fine piece of work
would be the consequence of my consent to your coming to town
yourself; nay, it was indeed your own headstrong will, nor can I
charge myself with having ever consented to it. Did not you promise
me, brother, that you would take none of these headstrong measures?
Was it not by these headstrong measures that you forced my niece to
run away from you in the country? Have you a mind to oblige her to
take such another step?" "Z--ds and the devil!" cries the squire,
dashing his pipe on the ground; "did ever mortal hear the like? when I
expected you would have commended me for all I have done, to be fallen
upon in this manner!" "How, brother!" said the lady, "have I ever
given you the least reason to imagine I should commend you for locking
up your daughter? Have I not often told you that women in a free
country are not to be treated with such arbitrary power? We are as
free as the men, and I heartily wish I could not say we deserve that
freedom better. If you expect I should stay a moment longer in this
wretched house, or that I should ever own you again as my relation, or
that I should ever trouble myself again with the affairs of your
family, I insist upon it that my niece be set at liberty this
instant." This she spoke with so commanding an air, standing with her
back to the fire, with one hand behind her, and a pinch of snuff in
the other, that I question whether Thalestris, at the head of her
Amazons, ever made a more tremendous figure. It is no wonder,
therefore, that the poor squire was not proof against the awe which
she inspired. "There," he cried, throwing down the key, "there it is,
do whatever you please. I intended only to have kept her up till
Blifil came to town, which can't be long; and now if any harm happens
in the mean time, remember who is to be blamed for it."

"I will answer it with my life," cried Mrs Western, "but I shall not
intermeddle at all, unless upon one condition, and that is, that you
will commit the whole entirely to my care, without taking any one
measure yourself, unless I shall eventually appoint you to act. If you
ratify these preliminaries, brother, I yet will endeavour to preserve
the honour of your family; if not, I shall continue in a neutral
state."

"I pray you, good sir," said the parson, "permit yourself this once to
be admonished by her ladyship: peradventure, by communing with young
Madam Sophia, she will effect more than you have been able to
perpetrate by more rigorous measures."

"What, dost thee open upon me?" cries the squire: "if thee dost begin
to babble, I shall whip thee in presently."

"Fie, brother," answered the lady, "is this language to a clergyman?
Mr Supple is a man of sense, and gives you the best advice; and the
whole world, I believe, will concur in his opinion; but I must tell
you I expect an immediate answer to my categorical proposals. Either
cede your daughter to my disposal, or take her wholly to your own
surprizing discretion, and then I here, before Mr Supple, evacuate the
garrison, and renounce you and your family for ever."

"I pray you let me be a mediator," cries the parson, "let me
supplicate you."

"Why, there lies the key on the table," cries the squire. "She may
take un up, if she pleases: who hinders her?"

"No, brother," answered the lady, "I insist on the formality of its
being delivered me, with a full ratification of all the concessions
stipulated."

"Why then I will deliver it to you.--There 'tis," cries the squire. "I
am sure, sister, you can't accuse me of ever denying to trust my
daughter to you. She hath a-lived wi' you a whole year and muore to a
time, without my ever zeeing her."

"And it would have been happy for her," answered the lady, "if she had
always lived with me. Nothing of this kind would have happened under
my eye."

"Ay, certainly," cries he, "I only am to blame."

"Why, you are to blame, brother," answered she. "I have been often
obliged to tell you so, and shall always be obliged to tell you so.
However, I hope you will now amend, and gather so much experience from
past errors, as not to defeat my wisest machinations by your blunders.
Indeed, brother, you are not qualified for these negociations. All
your whole scheme of politics is wrong. I once more, therefore,
insist, that you do not intermeddle. Remember only what is past."----

"Z--ds and bl--d, sister," cries the squire, "what would you have me
say? You are enough to provoke the devil."

"There, now," said she, "just according to the old custom. I see,
brother, there is no talking to you. I will appeal to Mr Supple, who
is a man of sense, if I said anything which could put any human
creature into a passion; but you are so wrongheaded every way."

"Let me beg you, madam," said the parson, "not to irritate his
worship."

"Irritate him?" said the lady; "sure, you are as great a fool as
himself. Well, brother, since you have promised not to interfere, I
will once more undertake the management of my niece. Lord have mercy
upon all affairs which are under the directions of men! The head of
one woman is worth a thousand of yours." And now having summoned a
servant to show her to Sophia, she departed, bearing the key with her.

She was no sooner gone, than the squire (having first shut the door)
ejaculated twenty bitches, and as many hearty curses against her, not
sparing himself for having ever thought of her estate; but added, "Now
one hath been a slave so long, it would be pity to lose it at last,
for want of holding out a little longer. The bitch can't live for
ever, and I know I am down for it upon the will."

The parson greatly commended this resolution: and now the squire
having ordered in another bottle, which was his usual method when
anything either pleased or vexed him, did, by drinking plentifully of
this medicinal julap, so totally wash away his choler, that his temper
was become perfectly placid and serene, when Mrs Western returned with
Sophia into the room. The young lady had on her hat and capuchin, and
the aunt acquainted Mr Western, "that she intended to take her niece
with her to her own lodgings; for, indeed, brother," says she, "these
rooms are not fit to receive a Christian soul in."

"Very well, madam," quoth Western, "whatever you please. The girl can
never be in better hands than yours; and the parson here can do me the
justice to say, that I have said fifty times behind your back, that
you was one of the most sensible women in the world."

"To this," cries the parson, "I am ready to bear testimony."

"Nay, brother," says Mrs Western, "I have always, I'm sure, given you
as favourable a character. You must own you have a little too much
hastiness in your temper; but when you will allow yourself time to
reflect I never knew a man more reasonable."

"Why then, sister, if you think so," said the squire, "here's your
good health with all my heart. I am a little passionate sometimes, but
I scorn to bear any malice. Sophy, do you be a good girl, and do
everything your aunt orders you."

"I have not the least doubt of her," answered Mrs Western. "She hath
had already an example before her eyes in the behaviour of that wretch
her cousin Harriet, who ruined herself by neglecting my advice. O
brother, what think you? You was hardly gone out of hearing, when you
set out for London, when who should arrive but that impudent fellow
with the odious Irish name--that Fitzpatrick. He broke in abruptly
upon me without notice, or I would not have seen him. He ran on a
long, unintelligible story about his wife, to which he forced me to
give him a hearing; but I made him very little answer, and delivered
him the letter from his wife, which I bid him answer himself. I
suppose the wretch will endeavour to find us out, but I beg you will
not see her, for I am determined I will not."

"I zee her!" answered the squire; "you need not fear me. I'll ge no
encouragement to such undutiful wenches. It is well for the fellow,
her husband, I was not at huome. Od rabbit it, he should have taken a
dance thru the horse-pond, I promise un. You zee, Sophy, what
undutifulness brings volks to. You have an example in your own
family."

"Brother," cries the aunt, "you need not shock my niece by such odious
repetitions. Why will you not leave everything entirely to me?" "Well,
well, I wull, I wull," said the squire.

And now Mrs Western, luckily for Sophia, put an end to the
conversation by ordering chairs to be called. I say luckily, for had
it continued much longer, fresh matter of dissension would, most
probably, have arisen between the brother and sister; between whom
education and sex made the only difference; for both were equally
violent and equally positive: they had both a vast affection for
Sophia, and both a sovereign contempt for each other.



Chapter v.

In which Jones receives a letter from Sophia, and goes to a play with
Mrs Miller and Partridge.


The arrival of Black George in town, and the good offices which that
grateful fellow had promised to do for his old benefactor, greatly
comforted Jones in the midst of all the anxiety and uneasiness which
he had suffered on the account of Sophia; from whom, by the means of
the said George, he received the following answer to his letter, which
Sophia, to whom the use of pen, ink, and paper was restored with her
liberty, wrote the very evening when she departed from her
confinement:

  "Sir,

  "As I do not doubt your sincerity in what you write, you will be
  pleased to hear that some of my afflictions are at an end, by the
  arrival of my aunt Western, with whom I am at present, and with whom
  I enjoy all the liberty I can desire. One promise my aunt hath
  insisted on my making, which is, that I will not see or converse
  with any person without her knowledge and consent. This promise I
  have most solemnly given, and shall most inviolably keep: and though
  she hath not expressly forbidden me writing, yet that must be an
  omission from forgetfulness; or this, perhaps, is included in the
  word conversing. However, as I cannot but consider this as a breach
  of her generous confidence in my honour, you cannot expect that I
  shall, after this, continue to write myself or to receive letters,
  without her knowledge. A promise is with me a very sacred thing, and
  to be extended to everything understood from it, as well as to what
  is expressed by it; and this consideration may, perhaps, on
  reflection, afford you some comfort. But why should I mention a
  comfort to you of this kind; for though there is one thing in which
  I can never comply with the best of fathers, yet am I firmly
  resolved never to act in defiance of him, or to take any step of
  consequence without his consent. A firm persuasion of this must
  teach you to divert your thoughts from what fortune hath (perhaps)
  made impossible. This your own interest persuades you. This may
  reconcile, I hope, Mr Allworthy to you; and if it will, you have my
  injunctions to pursue it. Accidents have laid some obligations on
  me, and your good intentions probably more. Fortune may, perhaps, be
  some time kinder to us both than at present. Believe this, that I
  shall always think of you as I think you deserve, and am,

                         Sir,
                    your obliged humble servant,
                                 Sophia Western.

  "I charge you write to me no more--at present at least; and accept
  this, which is now of no service to me, which I know you must want,
  and think you owe the trifle only to that fortune by which you found
  it."[*]

  [*] Meaning, perhaps, the bank-bill for £100.

A child who hath just learnt his letters would have spelt this letter
out in less time than Jones took in reading it. The sensations it
occasioned were a mixture of joy and grief; somewhat like what divide
the mind of a good man when he peruses the will of his deceased
friend, in which a large legacy, which his distresses make the more
welcome, is bequeathed to him. Upon the whole, however, he was more
pleased than displeased; and, indeed, the reader may probably wonder
that he was displeased at all; but the reader is not quite so much in
love as was poor Jones; and love is a disease which, though it may, in
some instances, resemble a consumption (which it sometimes causes), in
others proceeds in direct opposition to it, and particularly in this,
that it never flatters itself, or sees any one symptom in a favourable
light.

One thing gave him complete satisfaction, which was, that his mistress
had regained her liberty, and was now with a lady where she might at
least assure herself of a decent treatment. Another comfortable
circumstance was the reference which she made to her promise of never
marrying any other man; for however disinterested he might imagine his
passion, and notwithstanding all the generous overtures made in his
letter, I very much question whether he could have heard a more
afflicting piece of news than that Sophia was married to another,
though the match had been never so great, and never so likely to end
in making her completely happy. That refined degree of Platonic
affection which is absolutely detached from the flesh, and is, indeed,
entirely and purely spiritual, is a gift confined to the female part
of the creation; many of whom I have heard declare (and, doubtless,
with great truth), that they would, with the utmost readiness, resign
a lover to a rival, when such resignation was proved to be necessary
for the temporal interest of such lover. Hence, therefore, I conclude
that this affection is in nature, though I cannot pretend to say I
have ever seen an instance of it.

Mr Jones having spent three hours in reading and kissing the aforesaid
letter, and being, at last, in a state of good spirits, from the
last-mentioned considerations, he agreed to carry an appointment,
which he had before made, into execution. This was, to attend Mrs
Miller, and her younger daughter, into the gallery at the play-house,
and to admit Mr Partridge as one of the company. For as Jones had
really that taste for humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy
much entertainment in the criticisms of Partridge, from whom he
expected the simple dictates of nature, unimproved, indeed, but
likewise unadulterated, by art.

In the first row then of the first gallery did Mr Jones, Mrs Miller,
her youngest daughter, and Partridge, take their places. Partridge
immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. When
the first music was played, he said, "It was a wonder how so many
fiddlers could play at one time, without putting one another out."
While the fellow was lighting the upper candles, he cried out to Mrs
Miller, "Look, look, madam, the very picture of the man in the end of
the common-prayer book before the gunpowder-treason service." Nor
could he help observing, with a sigh, when all the candles were
lighted, "That here were candles enough burnt in one night, to keep an
honest poor family for a whole twelvemonth."

As soon as the play, which was Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, began,
Partridge was all attention, nor did he break silence till the
entrance of the ghost; upon which he asked Jones, "What man that was
in the strange dress; something," said he, "like what I have seen in a
picture. Sure it is not armour, is it?" Jones answered, "That is the
ghost." To which Partridge replied with a smile, "Persuade me to that,
sir, if you can. Though I can't say I ever actually saw a ghost in my
life, yet I am certain I should know one, if I saw him, better than
that comes to. No, no, sir, ghosts don't appear in such dresses as
that, neither." In this mistake, which caused much laughter in the
neighbourhood of Partridge, he was suffered to continue, till the
scene between the ghost and Hamlet, when Partridge gave that credit to
Mr Garrick, which he had denied to Jones, and fell into so violent a
trembling, that his knees knocked against each other. Jones asked him
what was the matter, and whether he was afraid of the warrior upon the
stage? "O la! sir," said he, "I perceive now it is what you told me. I
am not afraid of anything; for I know it is but a play. And if it was
really a ghost, it could do one no harm at such a distance, and in so
much company; and yet if I was frightened, I am not the only person."
"Why, who," cries Jones, "dost thou take to be such a coward here
besides thyself?" "Nay, you may call me coward if you will; but if
that little man there upon the stage is not frightened, I never saw
any man frightened in my life. Ay, ay: go along with you: Ay, to be
sure! Who's fool then? Will you? Lud have mercy upon such
fool-hardiness!--Whatever happens, it is good enough for
you.----Follow you? I'd follow the devil as soon. Nay, perhaps it is
the devil----for they say he can put on what likeness he pleases.--Oh!
here he is again.----No farther! No, you have gone far enough already;
farther than I'd have gone for all the king's dominions." Jones
offered to speak, but Partridge cried "Hush, hush! dear sir, don't you
hear him?" And during the whole speech of the ghost, he sat with his
eyes fixed partly on the ghost and partly on Hamlet, and with his
mouth open; the same passions which succeeded each other in Hamlet,
succeeding likewise in him.

When the scene was over Jones said, "Why, Partridge, you exceed my
expectations. You enjoy the play more than I conceived possible."
"Nay, sir," answered Partridge, "if you are not afraid of the devil, I
can't help it; but to be sure, it is natural to be surprized at such
things, though I know there is nothing in them: not that it was the
ghost that surprized me, neither; for I should have known that to have
been only a man in a strange dress; but when I saw the little man so
frightened himself, it was that which took hold of me." "And dost thou
imagine, then, Partridge," cries Jones, "that he was really
frightened?" "Nay, sir," said Partridge, "did not you yourself observe
afterwards, when he found it was his own father's spirit, and how he
was murdered in the garden, how his fear forsook him by degrees, and
he was struck dumb with sorrow, as it were, just as I should have
been, had it been my own case?--But hush! O la! what noise is that?
There he is again.----Well, to be certain, though I know there is
nothing at all in it, I am glad I am not down yonder, where those men
are." Then turning his eyes again upon Hamlet, "Ay, you may draw your
sword; what signifies a sword against the power of the devil?"

During the second act, Partridge made very few remarks. He greatly
admired the fineness of the dresses; nor could he help observing upon
the king's countenance. "Well," said he, "how people may be deceived
by faces! _Nulla fides fronti_ is, I find, a true saying. Who would
think, by looking in the king's face, that he had ever committed a
murder?" He then enquired after the ghost; but Jones, who intended he
should be surprized, gave him no other satisfaction, than, "that he
might possibly see him again soon, and in a flash of fire."

Partridge sat in a fearful expectation of this; and now, when the
ghost made his next appearance, Partridge cried out, "There, sir, now;
what say you now? is he frightened now or no? As much frightened as
you think me, and, to be sure, nobody can help some fears. I would not
be in so bad a condition as what's his name, squire Hamlet, is there,
for all the world. Bless me! what's become of the spirit? As I am a
living soul, I thought I saw him sink into the earth." "Indeed, you
saw right," answered Jones. "Well, well," cries Partridge, "I know it
is only a play: and besides, if there was anything in all this, Madam
Miller would not laugh so; for as to you, sir, you would not be
afraid, I believe, if the devil was here in person.--There, there--Ay,
no wonder you are in such a passion, shake the vile wicked wretch to
pieces. If she was my own mother, I would serve her so. To be sure all
duty to a mother is forfeited by such wicked doings.----Ay, go about
your business, I hate the sight of you."

Our critic was now pretty silent till the play, which Hamlet
introduces before the king. This he did not at first understand, till
Jones explained it to him; but he no sooner entered into the spirit of
it, than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder.
Then turning to Mrs Miller, he asked her, "If she did not imagine the
king looked as if he was touched; though he is," said he, "a good
actor, and doth all he can to hide it. Well, I would not have so much
to answer for, as that wicked man there hath, to sit upon a much
higher chair than he sits upon. No wonder he ran away; for your sake
I'll never trust an innocent face again."

The grave-digging scene next engaged the attention of Partridge, who
expressed much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the stage.
To which Jones answered, "That it was one of the most famous
burial-places about town." "No wonder then," cries Partridge, "that
the place is haunted. But I never saw in my life a worse grave-digger.
I had a sexton, when I was clerk, that should have dug three graves
while he is digging one. The fellow handles a spade as if it was the
first time he had ever had one in his hand. Ay, ay, you may sing. You
had rather sing than work, I believe."--Upon Hamlet's taking up the
skull, he cried out, "Well! it is strange to see how fearless some men
are: I never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to a dead
man, on any account.--He seemed frightened enough too at the ghost, I
thought. _Nemo omnibus horis sapit._"

Little more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of
which Jones asked him, "Which of the players he had liked best?" To
this he answered, with some appearance of indignation at the question,
"The king, without doubt." "Indeed, Mr Partridge," says Mrs Miller,
"you are not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all
agreed, that Hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the
stage." "He the best player!" cries Partridge, with a contemptuous
sneer, "why, I could act as well as he myself. I am sure, if I had
seen a ghost, I should have looked in the very same manner, and done
just as he did. And then, to be sure, in that scene, as you called it,
between him and his mother, where you told me he acted so fine, why,
Lord help me, any man, that is, any good man, that had such a mother,
would have done exactly the same. I know you are only joking with me;
but indeed, madam, though I was never at a play in London, yet I have
seen acting before in the country; and the king for my money; he
speaks all his words distinctly, half as loud again as the
other.--Anybody may see he is an actor."

While Mrs Miller was thus engaged in conversation with Partridge, a
lady came up to Mr Jones, whom he immediately knew to be Mrs
Fitzpatrick. She said, she had seen him from the other part of the
gallery, and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him, as she had
something to say, which might be of great service to himself. She then
acquainted him with her lodgings, and made him an appointment the next
day in the morning; which, upon recollection, she presently changed to
the afternoon; at which time Jones promised to attend her.

Thus ended the adventure at the playhouse; where Partridge had
afforded great mirth, not only to Jones and Mrs Miller, but to all who
sat within hearing, who were more attentive to what he said, than to
anything that passed on the stage.

He durst not go to bed all that night, for fear of the ghost; and for
many nights after sweated two or three hours before he went to sleep,
with the same apprehensions, and waked several times in great horrors,
crying out, "Lord have mercy upon us! there it is."



Chapter vi.

In which the history is obliged to look back.


It is almost impossible for the best parent to observe an exact
impartiality to his children, even though no superior merit should
bias his affection; but sure a parent can hardly be blamed, when that
superiority determines his preference.

As I regard all the personages of this history in the light of my
children; so I must confess the same inclination of partiality to
Sophia; and for that I hope the reader will allow me the same excuse,
from the superiority of her character.

This extraordinary tenderness which I have for my heroine never
suffers me to quit her any long time without the utmost reluctance. I
could now, therefore, return impatiently to enquire what hath happened
to this lovely creature since her departure from her father's, but
that I am obliged first to pay a short visit to Mr Blifil.

Mr Western, in the first confusion into which his mind was cast upon
the sudden news he received of his daughter, and in the first hurry to
go after her, had not once thought of sending any account of the
discovery to Blifil. He had not gone far, however, before he
recollected himself, and accordingly stopt at the very first inn he
came to, and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint Blifil with his
having found Sophia, and with his firm resolution to marry her to him
immediately, if he would come up after him to town.

As the love which Blifil had for Sophia was of that violent kind,
which nothing but the loss of her fortune, or some such accident,
could lessen, his inclination to the match was not at all altered by
her having run away, though he was obliged to lay this to his own
account. He very readily, therefore, embraced this offer. Indeed, he
now proposed the gratification of a very strong passion besides
avarice, by marrying this young lady, and this was hatred; for he
concluded that matrimony afforded an equal opportunity of satisfying
either hatred or love; and this opinion is very probably verified by
much experience. To say the truth, if we are to judge by the ordinary
behaviour of married persons to each other, we shall perhaps be apt to
conclude that the generality seek the indulgence of the former passion
only, in their union of everything but of hearts.

There was one difficulty, however, in his way, and this arose from Mr
Allworthy. That good man, when he found by the departure of Sophia
(for neither that, nor the cause of it, could be concealed from him),
the great aversion which she had for his nephew, began to be seriously
concerned that he had been deceived into carrying matters so far. He
by no means concurred with the opinion of those parents, who think it
as immaterial to consult the inclinations of their children in the
affair of marriage, as to solicit the good pleasure of their servants
when they intend to take a journey; and who are by law, or decency at
least, withheld often from using absolute force. On the contrary, as
he esteemed the institution to be of the most sacred kind, he thought
every preparatory caution necessary to preserve it holy and inviolate;
and very wisely concluded, that the surest way to effect this was by
laying the foundation in previous affection.

Blifil indeed soon cured his uncle of all anger on the score of
deceit, by many vows and protestations that he had been deceived
himself, with which the many declarations of Western very well
tallied; but now to persuade Allworthy to consent to the renewing his
addresses was a matter of such apparent difficulty, that the very
appearance was sufficient to have deterred a less enterprizing genius;
but this young gentleman so well knew his own talents, that nothing
within the province of cunning seemed to him hard to be achieved.

Here then he represented the violence of his own affection, and the
hopes of subduing aversion in the lady by perseverance. He begged
that, in an affair on which depended all his future repose, he might
at least be at liberty to try all fair means for success. Heaven
forbid, he said, that he should ever think of prevailing by any other
than the most gentle methods! "Besides, sir," said he, "if they fail,
you may then (which will be surely time enough) deny your consent." He
urged the great and eager desire which Mr Western had for the match;
and lastly, he made great use of the name of Jones, to whom he imputed
all that had happened; and from whom, he said, to preserve so valuable
a young lady was even an act of charity.

All these arguments were well seconded by Thwackum, who dwelt a little
stronger on the authority of parents than Mr Blifil himself had done.
He ascribed the measures which Mr Blifil was desirous to take to
Christian motives; "and though," says he, "the good young gentleman
hath mentioned charity last, I am almost convinced it is his first and
principal consideration."

Square, possibly, had he been present, would have sung to the same
tune, though in a different key, and would have discovered much moral
fitness in the proceeding: but he was now gone to Bath for the
recovery of his health.

Allworthy, though not without reluctance, at last yielded to the
desires of his nephew. He said he would accompany him to London, where
he might be at liberty to use every honest endeavour to gain the lady:
"But I declare," said he, "I will never give my consent to any
absolute force being put on her inclinations, nor shall you ever have
her, unless she can be brought freely to compliance."

Thus did the affection of Allworthy for his nephew betray the superior
understanding to be triumphed over by the inferior; and thus is the
prudence of the best of heads often defeated by the tenderness of the
best of hearts.

Blifil, having obtained this unhoped-for acquiescence in his uncle,
rested not till he carried his purpose into execution. And as no
immediate business required Mr Allworthy's presence in the country,
and little preparation is necessary to men for a journey, they set out
the very next day, and arrived in town that evening, when Mr Jones, as
we have seen, was diverting himself with Partridge at the play.

The morning after his arrival Mr Blifil waited on Mr Western, by whom
he was most kindly and graciously received, and from whom he had every
possible assurance (perhaps more than was possible) that he should
very shortly be as happy as Sophia could make him; nor would the
squire suffer the young gentleman to return to his uncle till he had,
almost against his will, carried him to his sister.



Chapter vii.

In which Mr Western pays a visit to his sister, in company with Mr
Blifil.


Mrs Western was reading a lecture on prudence, and matrimonial
politics, to her niece, when her brother and Blifil broke in with less
ceremony than the laws of visiting require. Sophia no sooner saw
Blifil than she turned pale, and almost lost the use of all her
faculties; but her aunt, on the contrary, waxed red, and, having all
her faculties at command, began to exert her tongue on the squire.

"Brother," said she, "I am astonished at your behaviour; will you
never learn any regard to decorum? Will you still look upon every
apartment as your own, or as belonging to one of your country tenants?
Do you think yourself at liberty to invade the privacies of women of
condition, without the least decency or notice?"----"Why, what a pox
is the matter now?" quoth the squire; "one would think I had caught
you at--"--"None of your brutality, sir, I beseech you," answered
she.----"You have surprized my poor niece so, that she can hardly, I
see, support herself.----Go, my dear, retire, and endeavour to recruit
your spirits; for I see you have occasion." At which words Sophia, who
never received a more welcome command, hastily withdrew.

"To be sure, sister," cries the squire, "you are mad, when I have
brought Mr Blifil here to court her, to force her away."

"Sure, brother," says she, "you are worse than mad, when you know in
what situation affairs are, to----I am sure I ask Mr Blifil's pardon,
but he knows very well to whom to impute so disagreeable a reception.
For my own part, I am sure I shall always be very glad to see Mr
Blifil; but his own good sense would not have suffered him to proceed
so abruptly, had you not compelled him to it."

Blifil bowed and stammered, and looked like a fool; but Western,
without giving him time to form a speech for the purpose, answered,
"Well, well, I am to blame, if you will, I always am, certainly; but
come, let the girl be fetched back again, or let Mr Blifil go to
her.----He's come up on purpose, and there is no time to be lost."

"Brother," cries Mrs Western, "Mr Blifil, I am confident, understands
himself better than to think of seeing my niece any more this morning,
after what hath happened. Women are of a nice contexture; and our
spirits, when disordered, are not to be recomposed in a moment. Had
you suffered Mr Blifil to have sent his compliments to my niece, and
to have desired the favour of waiting on her in the afternoon, I
should possibly have prevailed on her to have seen him; but now I
despair of bringing about any such matter."

"I am very sorry, madam," cried Blifil, "that Mr Western's
extraordinary kindness to me, which I can never enough acknowledge,
should have occasioned--" "Indeed, sir," said she, interrupting him,
"you need make no apologies, we all know my brother so well."

"I don't care what anybody knows of me," answered the squire;----"but
when must he come to see her? for, consider, I tell you, he is come
up on purpose, and so is Allworthy."--"Brother," said she, "whatever
message Mr Blifil thinks proper to send to my niece shall be
delivered to her; and I suppose she will want no instructions to make
a proper answer. I am convinced she will not refuse to see Mr Blifil
at a proper time."--"The devil she won't!" answered the
squire.--"Odsbud!--Don't we know--I say nothing, but some volk are
wiser than all the world.----If I might have had my will, she had not
run away before: and now I expect to hear every moment she is guone
again. For as great a fool as some volk think me, I know very well
she hates----" "No matter, brother," replied Mrs Western, "I will not
hear my niece abused. It is a reflection on my family. She is an
honour to it; and she will be an honour to it, I promise you. I will
pawn my whole reputation in the world on her conduct.----I shall be
glad to see you, brother, in the afternoon; for I have somewhat of
importance to mention to you.--At present, Mr Blifil, as well as you,
must excuse me; for I am in haste to dress." "Well, but," said the
squire, "do appoint a time." "Indeed," said she, "I can appoint no
time. I tell you I will see you in the afternoon."--"What the devil
would you have me do?" cries the squire, turning to Blifil; "I can no
more turn her, than a beagle can turn an old hare. Perhaps she will
be in a better humour in the afternoon."--"I am condemned, I see,
sir, to misfortune," answered Blifil; "but I shall always own my
obligations to you." He then took a ceremonious leave of Mrs Western,
who was altogether as ceremonious on her part; and then they
departed, the squire muttering to himself with an oath, that Blifil
should see his daughter in the afternoon.

If Mr Western was little pleased with this interview, Blifil was less.
As to the former, he imputed the whole behaviour of his sister to her
humour only, and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in
the visit; but Blifil saw a little deeper into things. He suspected
somewhat of more consequence, from two or three words which dropt from
the lady; and, to say the truth, he suspected right, as will appear
when I have unfolded the several matters which will be contained in
the following chapter.



Chapter viii.

Schemes of Lady Bellaston for the ruin of Jones.


Love had taken too deep a root in the mind of Lord Fellamar to be
plucked up by the rude hands of Mr Western. In the heat of resentment
he had, indeed, given a commission to Captain Egglane, which the
captain had far exceeded in the execution; nor had it been executed at
all, had his lordship been able to find the captain after he had seen
Lady Bellaston, which was in the afternoon of the day after he had
received the affront; but so industrious was the captain in the
discharge of his duty, that, having after long enquiry found out the
squire's lodgings very late in the evening, he sat up all night at a
tavern, that he might not miss the squire in the morning, and by that
means missed the revocation which my lord had sent to his lodgings.

In the afternoon then next after the intended rape of Sophia, his
lordship, as we have said, made a visit to Lady Bellaston, who laid
open so much of the character of the squire, that his lordship plainly
saw the absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any offence at his
words, especially as he had those honourable designs on his daughter.
He then unbosomed the violence of his passion to Lady Bellaston, who
readily undertook the cause, and encouraged him with certain assurance
of a most favourable reception from all the elders of the family, and
from the father himself when he should be sober, and should be made
acquainted with the nature of the offer made to his daughter. The only
danger, she said, lay in the fellow she had formerly mentioned, who,
though a beggar and a vagabond, had, by some means or other, she knew
not what, procured himself tolerable cloaths, and past for a
gentleman. "Now," says she, "as I have, for the sake of my cousin,
made it my business to enquire after this fellow, I have luckily found
out his lodgings;" with which she then acquainted his lordship. "I am
thinking, my lord," added she "(for this fellow is too mean for your
personal resentment), whether it would not be possible for your
lordship to contrive some method of having him pressed and sent on
board a ship. Neither law nor conscience forbid this project: for the
fellow, I promise you, however well drest, is but a vagabond, and as
proper as any fellow in the streets to be pressed into the service;
and as for the conscientious part, surely the preservation of a young
lady from such ruin is a most meritorious act; nay, with regard to the
fellow himself, unless he could succeed (which Heaven forbid) with my
cousin, it may probably be the means of preserving him from the
gallows, and perhaps may make his fortune in an honest way."

Lord Fellamar very heartily thanked her ladyship for the part which
she was pleased to take in the affair, upon the success of which his
whole future happiness entirely depended. He said, he saw at present
no objection to the pressing scheme, and would consider of putting it
in execution. He then most earnestly recommended to her ladyship to do
him the honour of immediately mentioning his proposals to the family;
to whom he said he offered a _carte blanche_, and would settle his
fortune in almost any manner they should require. And after uttering
many ecstasies and raptures concerning Sophia, he took his leave and
departed, but not before he had received the strongest charge to
beware of Jones, and to lose no time in securing his person, where he
should no longer be in a capacity of making any attempts to the ruin
of the young lady.

The moment Mrs Western was arrived at her lodgings, a card was
despatched with her compliments to Lady Bellaston; who no sooner
received it than, with the impatience of a lover, she flew to her
cousin, rejoiced at this fair opportunity, which beyond her hopes
offered itself, for she was much better pleased with the prospect of
making the proposals to a woman of sense, and who knew the world, than
to a gentleman whom she honoured with the appellation of Hottentot;
though, indeed, from him she apprehended no danger of a refusal.

The two ladies being met, after very short previous ceremonials, fell
to business, which was indeed almost as soon concluded as begun; for
Mrs Western no sooner heard the name of Lord Fellamar than her cheeks
glowed with pleasure; but when she was acquainted with the eagerness
of his passion, the earnestness of his proposals, and the generosity
of his offer, she declared her full satisfaction in the most explicit
terms.

In the progress of their conversation their discourse turned to Jones,
and both cousins very pathetically lamented the unfortunate attachment
which both agreed Sophia had to that young fellow; and Mrs Western
entirely attributed it to the folly of her brother's management. She
concluded, however, at last, with declaring her confidence in the good
understanding of her niece, who, though she would not give up her
affection in favour of Blifil, will, I doubt not, says she, soon be
prevailed upon to sacrifice a simple inclination to the addresses of a
fine gentleman, who brings her both a title and a large estate: "For,
indeed," added she, "I must do Sophy the justice to confess this
Blifil is but a hideous kind of fellow, as you know, Bellaston, all
country gentlemen are, and hath nothing but his fortune to recommend
him."

"Nay," said Lady Bellaston, "I don't then so much wonder at my cousin;
for I promise you this Jones is a very agreeable fellow, and hath one
virtue, which the men say is a great recommendation to us. What do you
think, Mrs Western--I shall certainly make you laugh; nay, I can
hardly tell you myself for laughing--will you believe that the fellow
hath had the assurance to make love to me? But if you should be
inclined to disbelieve it, here is evidence enough, his own
handwriting, I assure you." She then delivered her cousin the letter
with the proposals of marriage, which, if the reader hath a desire to
see, he will find already on record in the XVth book of this history.

"Upon my word I am astonished," said Mrs Western; "this is, indeed, a
masterpiece of assurance. With your leave I may possibly make some use
of this letter." "You have my full liberty," cries Lady Bellaston, "to
apply it to what purpose you please. However, I would not have it
shewn to any but Miss Western, nor to her unless you find occasion."
"Well, and how did you use the fellow?" returned Mrs Western. "Not as
a husband," said the lady; "I am not married, I promise you, my dear.
You know, Bell, I have tried the comforts once already; and once, I
think, is enough for any reasonable woman."

This letter Lady Bellaston thought would certainly turn the balance
against Jones in the mind of Sophia, and she was emboldened to give it
up, partly by her hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the
way, and partly by having secured the evidence of Honour, who, upon
sounding her, she saw sufficient reason to imagine was prepared to
testify whatever she pleased.

But perhaps the reader may wonder why Lady Bellaston, who in her heart
hated Sophia, should be so desirous of promoting a match which was so
much to the interest of the young lady. Now, I would desire such
readers to look carefully into human nature, page almost the last, and
there he will find, in scarce legible characters, that women,
notwithstanding the preposterous behaviour of mothers, aunts, &c., in
matrimonial matters, do in reality think it so great a misfortune to
have their inclinations in love thwarted, that they imagine they ought
never to carry enmity higher than upon these disappointments; again,
he will find it written much about the same place, that a woman who
hath once been pleased with the possession of a man, will go above
halfway to the devil, to prevent any other woman from enjoying the
same.

If he will not be contented with these reasons, I freely confess I see
no other motive to the actions of that lady, unless we will conceive
she was bribed by Lord Fellamar, which for my own part I see no cause
to suspect.

Now this was the affair which Mrs Western was preparing to introduce
to Sophia, by some prefatory discourse on the folly of love, and on
the wisdom of legal prostitution for hire, when her brother and Blifil
broke abruptly in upon her; and hence arose all that coldness in her
behaviour to Blifil, which, though the squire, as was usual with him,
imputed to a wrong cause, infused into Blifil himself (he being a much
more cunning man) a suspicion of the real truth.



Chapter ix.

In which Jones pays a visit to Mrs Fitzpatrick.


The reader may now, perhaps, be pleased to return with us to Mr Jones,
who, at the appointed hour, attended on Mrs Fitzpatrick; but before we
relate the conversation which now past it may be proper, according to
our method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an
alteration of behaviour in this lady, that from changing her lodging
principally to avoid Mr Jones, she had now industriously, as hath been
seen, sought this interview.

And here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding
day, when, hearing from Lady Bellaston that Mr Western was arrived in
town, she went to pay her duty to him, at his lodgings at Piccadilly,
where she was received with many scurvy compellations too coarse to be
repeated, and was even threatened to be kicked out of doors. From
hence, an old servant of her aunt Western, with whom she was well
acquainted, conducted her to the lodgings of that lady, who treated
her not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the truth, with
rudeness in another way. In short, she returned from both, plainly
convinced, not only that her scheme of reconciliation had proved
abortive, but that she must for ever give over all thoughts of
bringing it about by any means whatever. From this moment desire of
revenge only filled her mind; and in this temper meeting Jones at the
play, an opportunity seemed to her to occur of effecting this purpose.

The reader must remember that he was acquainted by Mrs Fitzpatrick, in
the account she gave of her own story, with the fondness Mrs Western
had formerly shewn for Mr Fitzpatrick at Bath, from the disappointment
of which Mrs Fitzpatrick derived the great bitterness her aunt had
expressed toward her. She had, therefore, no doubt but that the good
lady would as easily listen to the addresses of Mr Jones as she had
before done to the other; for the superiority of charms was clearly on
the side of Mr Jones; and the advance which her aunt had since made in
age, she concluded (how justly I will not say), was an argument rather
in favour of her project than against it.

Therefore, when Jones attended, after a previous declaration of her
desire of serving him, arising, as she said, from a firm assurance how
much she should by so doing oblige Sophia; and after some excuses for
her former disappointment, and after acquainting Mr Jones in whose
custody his mistress was, of which she thought him ignorant; she very
explicitly mentioned her scheme to him, and advised him to make sham
addresses to the older lady, in order to procure an easy access to the
younger, informing him at the same time of the success which Mr
Fitzpatrick had formerly owed to the very same stratagem.

Mr Jones expressed great gratitude to the lady for the kind intentions
towards him which she had expressed, and indeed testified, by this
proposal; but, besides intimating some diffidence of success from the
lady's knowledge of his love to her niece, which had not been her case
in regard to Mr Fitzpatrick, he said, he was afraid Miss Western would
never agree to an imposition of this kind, as well from her utter
detestation of all fallacy as from her avowed duty to her aunt.

Mrs Fitzpatrick was a little nettled at this; and indeed, if it may
not be called a lapse of the tongue, it was a small deviation from
politeness in Jones, and into which he scarce would have fallen, had
not the delight he felt in praising Sophia hurried him out of all
reflection; for this commendation of one cousin was more than a tacit
rebuke on the other.

"Indeed, sir," answered the lady, with some warmth, "I cannot think
there is anything easier than to cheat an old woman with a profession
of love, when her complexion is amorous; and, though she is my aunt, I
must say there never was a more liquorish one than her ladyship. Can't
you pretend that the despair of possessing her niece, from her being
promised to Blifil, has made you turn your thoughts towards her? As to
my cousin Sophia, I can't imagine her to be such a simpleton as to
have the least scruple on such an account, or to conceive any harm in
punishing one of these haggs for the many mischiefs they bring upon
families by their tragi-comic passions; for which I think it is a pity
they are not punishable by law. I had no such scruple myself; and yet
I hope my cousin Sophia will not think it an affront when I say she
cannot detest every real species of falsehood more than her cousin
Fitzpatrick. To my aunt, indeed, I pretend no duty, nor doth she
deserve any. However, sir, I have given you my advice; and if you
decline pursuing it, I shall have the less opinion of your
understanding--that's all."

Jones now clearly saw the error he had committed, and exerted his
utmost power to rectify it; but he only faultered and stuttered into
nonsense and contradiction. To say the truth, it is often safer to
abide by the consequences of the first blunder than to endeavour to
rectify it; for by such endeavours we generally plunge deeper instead
of extricating ourselves; and few persons will on such occasions have
the good-nature which Mrs Fitzpatrick displayed to Jones, by saying,
with a smile, "You need attempt no more excuses; for I can easily
forgive a real lover, whatever is the effect of fondness for his
mistress."

She then renewed her proposal, and very fervently recommended it,
omitting no argument which her invention could suggest on the subject;
for she was so violently incensed against her aunt, that scarce
anything was capable of affording her equal pleasure with exposing
her; and, like a true woman, she would see no difficulties in the
execution of a favourite scheme.

Jones, however, persisted in declining the undertaking, which had not,
indeed, the least probability of success. He easily perceived the
motives which induced Mrs Fitzpatrick to be so eager in pressing her
advice. He said he would not deny the tender and passionate regard he
had for Sophia; but was so conscious of the inequality of their
situations, that he could never flatter himself so far as to hope that
so divine a young lady would condescend to think on so unworthy a man;
nay, he protested, he could scarce bring himself to wish she should.
He concluded with a profession of generous sentiments, which we have
not at present leisure to insert.

There are some fine women (for I dare not here speak in too general
terms) with whom self is so predominant, that they never detach it
from any subject; and, as vanity is with them a ruling principle, they
are apt to lay hold of whatever praise they meet with; and, though the
property of others, convey it to their own use. In the company of
these ladies it is impossible to say anything handsome of another
woman which they will not apply to themselves; nay, they often improve
the praise they seize; as, for instance, if her beauty, her wit, her
gentility, her good humour deserve so much commendation, what do I
deserve, who possess those qualities in so much more eminent a degree?

To these ladies a man often recommends himself while he is commending
another woman; and, while he is expressing ardour and generous
sentiments for his mistress, they are considering what a charming
lover this man would make to them, who can feel all this tenderness
for an inferior degree of merit. Of this, strange as it may seem, I
have seen many instances besides Mrs Fitzpatrick, to whom all this
really happened, and who now began to feel a somewhat for Mr Jones,
the symptoms of which she much sooner understood than poor Sophia had
formerly done.

To say the truth, perfect beauty in both sexes is a more irresistible
object than it is generally thought; for, notwithstanding some of us
are contented with more homely lots, and learn by rote (as children to
repeat what gives them no idea) to despise outside, and to value more
solid charms; yet I have always observed, at the approach of
consummate beauty, that these more solid charms only shine with that
kind of lustre which the stars have after the rising of the sun.

When Jones had finished his exclamations, many of which would have
become the mouth of Oroöndates himself, Mrs Fitzpatrick heaved a
deep sigh, and, taking her eyes off from Jones, on whom they had been
some time fixed, and dropping them on the ground, she cried, "Indeed,
Mr Jones, I pity you; but it is the curse of such tenderness to be
thrown away on those who are insensible of it. I know my cousin better
than you, Mr Jones, and I must say, any woman who makes no return to
such a passion, and such a person, is unworthy of both."

"Sure, madam," said Jones, "you can't mean----" "Mean!" cries Mrs
Fitzpatrick, "I know not what I mean; there is something, I think, in
true tenderness bewitching; few women ever meet with it in men, and
fewer still know how to value it when they do. I never heard such
truly noble sentiments, and I can't tell how it is, but you force one
to believe you. Sure she must be the most contemptible of women who
can overlook such merit."

The manner and look with which all this was spoke infused a suspicion
into Jones which we don't care to convey in direct words to the
reader. Instead of making any answer, he said, "I am afraid, madam, I
have made too tiresome a visit;" and offered to take his leave.

"Not at all, sir," answered Mrs Fitzpatrick.--"Indeed I pity you, Mr
Jones; indeed I do: but if you are going, consider of the scheme I
have mentioned--I am convinced you will approve it--and let me see you
again as soon as you can.--To-morrow morning if you will, or at least
some time to-morrow. I shall be at home all day."

Jones, then, after many expressions of thanks, very respectfully
retired; nor could Mrs Fitzpatrick forbear making him a present of a
look at parting, by which if he had understood nothing, he must have
had no understanding in the language of the eyes. In reality, it
confirmed his resolution of returning to her no more; for, faulty as
he hath hitherto appeared in this history, his whole thoughts were now
so confined to his Sophia, that I believe no woman upon earth could
have now drawn him into an act of inconstancy.

Fortune, however, who was not his friend, resolved, as he intended to
give her no second opportunity, to make the best of this; and
accordingly produced the tragical incident which we are now in
sorrowful notes to record.



Chapter x.

The consequence of the preceding visit.


Mr Fitzpatrick having received the letter before mentioned from Mrs
Western, and being by that means acquainted with the place to which
his wife was retired, returned directly to Bath, and thence the day
after set forward to London.

The reader hath been already often informed of the jealous temper of
this gentleman. He may likewise be pleased to remember the suspicion
which he had conceived of Jones at Upton, upon his finding him in the
room with Mrs Waters; and, though sufficient reasons had afterwards
appeared entirely to clear up that suspicion, yet now the reading so
handsome a character of Mr Jones from his wife, caused him to reflect
that she likewise was in the inn at the same time, and jumbled
together such a confusion of circumstances in a head which was
naturally none of the clearest, that the whole produced that
green-eyed monster mentioned by Shakespear in his tragedy of Othello.

And now, as he was enquiring in the street after his wife, and had
just received directions to the door, unfortunately Mr Jones was
issuing from it.

Fitzpatrick did not yet recollect the face of Jones; however, seeing a
young well-dressed fellow coming from his wife, he made directly up to
him, and asked him what he had been doing in that house? "for I am
sure," said he, "you must have been in it, as I saw you come out of
it."

Jones answered very modestly, "That he had been visiting a lady
there." To which Fitzpatrick replied, "What business have you with the
lady?" Upon which Jones, who now perfectly remembered the voice,
features, and indeed coat, of the gentleman, cried out----"Ha, my good
friend! give me your hand; I hope there is no ill blood remaining
between us, upon a small mistake which happened so long ago."

"Upon my soul, sir," said Fitzpatrick, "I don't know your name nor
your face." "Indeed, sir," said Jones, "neither have I the pleasure of
knowing your name, but your face I very well remember to have seen
before at Upton, where a foolish quarrel happened between us, which,
if it is not made up yet, we will now make up over a bottle."

"At Upton!" cried the other;----"Ha! upon my soul, I believe your name
is Jones?" "Indeed," answered he, "it is."--"O! upon my soul," cries
Fitzpatrick, "you are the very man I wanted to meet.--Upon my soul I
will drink a bottle with you presently; but first I will give you a
great knock over the pate. There is for you, you rascal. Upon my soul,
if you do not give me satisfaction for that blow, I will give you
another." And then, drawing his sword, put himself in a posture of
defence, which was the only science he understood.

Jones was a little staggered by the blow, which came somewhat
unexpectedly; but presently recovering himself he also drew, and
though he understood nothing of fencing, prest on so boldly upon
Fitzpatrick, that he beat down his guard, and sheathed one half of his
sword in the body of the said gentleman, who had no sooner received it
than he stept backwards, dropped the point of his sword, and leaning
upon it, cried, "I have satisfaction enough: I am a dead man."

"I hope not," cries Jones, "but whatever be the consequence, you must
be sensible you have drawn it upon yourself." At this instant a number
of fellows rushed in and seized Jones, who told them he should make no
resistance, and begged some of them at least would take care of the
wounded gentleman.

"Ay," cries one of the fellows, "the wounded gentleman will be taken
care enough of; for I suppose he hath not many hours to live. As for
you, sir, you have a month at least good yet." "D--n me, Jack," said
another, "he hath prevented his voyage; he's bound to another port
now;" and many other such jests was our poor Jones made the subject of
by these fellows, who were indeed the gang employed by Lord Fellamar,
and had dogged him into the house of Mrs Fitzpatrick, waiting for him
at the corner of the street when this unfortunate accident happened.

The officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his
business was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil
magistrate. He ordered him, therefore, to be carried to a
public-house, where, having sent for a constable, he delivered him to
his custody.

The constable, seeing Mr Jones very well drest, and hearing that the
accident had happened in a duel, treated his prisoner with great
civility, and at his request dispatched a messenger to enquire after
the wounded gentleman, who was now at a tavern under the surgeon's
hands. The report brought back was, that the wound was certainly
mortal, and there were no hopes of life. Upon which the constable
informed Jones that he must go before a justice. He answered,
"Wherever you please; I am indifferent as to what happens to me; for
though I am convinced I am not guilty of murder in the eye of the law,
yet the weight of blood I find intolerable upon my mind."

Jones was now conducted before the justice, where the surgeon who
dressed Mr Fitzpatrick appeared, and deposed that he believed the
wound to be mortal; upon which the prisoner was committed to the
Gatehouse. It was very late at night, so that Jones would not send for
Partridge till the next morning; and, as he never shut his eyes till
seven, so it was near twelve before the poor fellow, who was greatly
frightened at not hearing from his master so long, received a message
which almost deprived him of his being when he heard it.

He went to the Gatehouse with trembling knees and a beating heart, and
was no sooner arrived in the presence of Jones than he lamented the
misfortune that had befallen him with many tears, looking all the
while frequently about him in great terror; for as the news now
arrived that Mr Fitzpatrick was dead, the poor fellow apprehended
every minute that his ghost would enter the room. At last he delivered
him a letter, which he had like to have forgot, and which came from
Sophia by the hands of Black George.

Jones presently dispatched every one out of the room, and, having
eagerly broke open the letter, read as follows:--

  "You owe the hearing from me again to an accident which I own
  surprizes me. My aunt hath just now shown me a letter from you to
  Lady Bellaston, which contains a proposal of marriage. I am
  convinced it is your own hand; and what more surprizes me is, that
  it is dated at the very time when you would have me imagine you was
  under such concern on my account.--I leave you to comment on this

Of the present situation of Mr Jones's mind, and of the pangs with
which he was now tormented, we cannot give the reader a better idea
than by saying, his misery was such that even Thwackum would almost
have pitied him. But, bad as it is, we shall at present leave him in
it, as his good genius (if he really had any) seems to have done. And
here we put an end to the sixteenth book of our history.




BOOK XVII.

CONTAINING THREE DAYS.



Chapter i.

Containing a portion of introductory writing.


When a comic writer hath made his principal characters as happy as he
can, or when a tragic writer hath brought them to the highest pitch of
human misery, they both conclude their business to be done, and that
their work is come to a period.

Had we been of the tragic complexion, the reader must now allow we
were very nearly arrived at this period, since it would be difficult
for the devil, or any of his representatives on earth, to have
contrived much greater torments for poor Jones than those in which we
left him in the last chapter; and as for Sophia, a good-natured woman
would hardly wish more uneasiness to a rival than what she must at
present be supposed to feel. What then remains to complete the tragedy
but a murder or two and a few moral sentences!

But to bring our favourites out of their present anguish and distress,
and to land them at last on the shore of happiness, seems a much
harder task; a task indeed so hard that we do not undertake to execute
it. In regard to Sophia, it is more than probable that we shall
somewhere or other provide a good husband for her in the end--either
Blifil, or my lord, or somebody else; but as to poor Jones, such are
the calamities in which he is at present involved, owing to his
imprudence, by which if a man doth not become felon to the world, he
is at least a _felo de se_; so destitute is he now of friends, and so
persecuted by enemies, that we almost despair of bringing him to any
good; and if our reader delights in seeing executions, I think he
ought not to lose any time in taking a first row at Tyburn.

This I faithfully promise, that, notwithstanding any affection which
we may be supposed to have for this rogue, whom we have unfortunately
made our heroe, we will lend him none of that supernatural assistance
with which we are entrusted, upon condition that we use it only on
very important occasions. If he doth not therefore find some natural
means of fairly extricating himself from all his distresses, we will
do no violence to the truth and dignity of history for his sake; for
we had rather relate that he was hanged at Tyburn (which may very
probably be the case) than forfeit our integrity, or shock the faith
of our reader.

In this the antients had a great advantage over the moderns. Their
mythology, which was at that time more firmly believed by the vulgar
than any religion is at present, gave them always an opportunity of
delivering a favourite heroe. Their deities were always ready at the
writer's elbow, to execute any of his purposes; and the more
extraordinary the invention was, the greater was the surprize and
delight of the credulous reader. Those writers could with greater ease
have conveyed a heroe from one country to another, nay from one world
to another, and have brought him back again, than a poor circumscribed
modern can deliver him from a jail.

The Arabians and Persians had an equal advantage in writing their
tales from the genii and fairies, which they believe in as an article
of their faith, upon the authority of the Koran itself. But we have
none of these helps. To natural means alone we are confined; let us
try therefore what, by these means, may be done for poor Jones; though
to confess the truth, something whispers me in the ear that he doth
not yet know the worst of his fortune; and that a more shocking piece
of news than any he hath yet heard remains for him in the unopened
leaves of fate.



Chapter ii.

The generous and grateful behaviour of Mrs Miller.


Mr Allworthy and Mrs Miller were just sat down to breakfast, when
Blifil, who had gone out very early that morning, returned to make one
of the company.

He had not been long seated before he began as follows: "Good Lord! my
dear uncle, what do you think hath happened? I vow I am afraid of
telling it you, for fear of shocking you with the remembrance of ever
having shewn any kindness to such a villain." "What is the matter,
child?" said the uncle. "I fear I have shewn kindness in my life to
the unworthy more than once. But charity doth not adopt the vices of
its objects." "O, sir!" returned Blifil, "it is not without the secret
direction of Providence that you mention the word adoption. Your
adopted son, sir, that Jones, that wretch whom you nourished in your
bosom, hath proved one of the greatest villains upon earth." "By all
that's sacred 'tis false," cries Mrs Miller. "Mr Jones is no villain.
He is one of the worthiest creatures breathing; and if any other
person had called him villain, I would have thrown all this boiling
water in his face." Mr Allworthy looked very much amazed at this
behaviour. But she did not give him leave to speak, before, turning to
him, she cried, "I hope you will not be angry with me; I would not
offend you, sir, for the world; but, indeed, I could not bear to hear
him called so." "I must own, madam," said Allworthy, very gravely, "I
am a little surprized to hear you so warmly defend a fellow you do not
know." "O! I do know him, Mr Allworthy," said she, "indeed I do; I
should be the most ungrateful of all wretches if I denied it. O! he
hath preserved me and my little family; we have all reason to bless
him while we live.--And I pray Heaven to bless him, and turn the
hearts of his malicious enemies. I know, I find, I see, he hath such."
"You surprize me, madam, still more," said Allworthy; "sure you must
mean some other. It is impossible you should have any such obligations
to the man my nephew mentions." "Too surely," answered she, "I have
obligations to him of the greatest and tenderest kind. He hath been
the preserver of me and mine. Believe me, sir, he hath been abused,
grossly abused to you; I know he hath, or you, whom I know to be all
goodness and honour, would not, after the many kind and tender things
I have heard you say of this poor helpless child, have so disdainfully
called him fellow.--Indeed, my best of friends, he deserves a kinder
appellation from you, had you heard the good, the kind, the grateful
things which I have heard him utter of you. He never mentions your
name but with a sort of adoration. In this very room I have seen him
on his knees, imploring all the blessings of heaven upon your head. I
do not love that child there better than he loves you."

"I see, sir, now," said Blifil, with one of those grinning sneers with
which the devil marks his best beloved, "Mrs Miller really doth know
him. I suppose you will find she is not the only one of your
acquaintance to whom he hath exposed you. As for my character, I
perceive, by some hints she hath thrown out, he hath been very free
with it, but I forgive him." "And the Lord forgive you, sir!" said Mrs
Miller; "we have all sins enough to stand in need of his forgiveness."

"Upon my word, Mrs Miller," said Allworthy, "I do not take this
behaviour of yours to my nephew kindly; and I do assure you, as any
reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest
of men, they would only serve, if that were possible, to heighten my
resentment against him: for I must tell you, Mrs Miller, the young man
who now stands before you hath ever been the warmest advocate for the
ungrateful wretch whose cause you espouse. This, I think, when you
hear it from my own mouth, will make you wonder at so much baseness
and ingratitude."

"You are deceived, sir," answered Mrs Miller; "if they were the last
words which were to issue from my lips, I would say you were deceived;
and I once more repeat it, the Lord forgive those who have deceived
you! I do not pretend to say the young man is without faults; but they
are all the faults of wildness and of youth; faults which he may, nay,
which I am certain he will, relinquish, and, if he should not, they
are vastly overbalanced by one of the most humane, tender, honest
hearts that ever man was blest with."

"Indeed, Mrs Miller," said Allworthy, "had this been related of you, I
should not have believed it." "Indeed, sir," answered she, "you will
believe everything I have said, I am sure you will: and when you have
heard the story which I shall tell you (for I will tell you all), you
will be so far from being offended, that you will own (I know your
justice so well), that I must have been the most despicable and most
ungrateful of wretches if I had acted any other part than I have."

"Well, madam," said Allworthy, "I shall be very glad to hear any good
excuse for a behaviour which, I must confess, I think wants an excuse.
And now, madam, will you be pleased to let my nephew proceed in his
story without interruption. He would not have introduced a matter of
slight consequence with such a preface. Perhaps even this story will
cure you of your mistake."

Mrs Miller gave tokens of submission, and then Mr Blifil began thus:
"I am sure, sir, if you don't think proper to resent the ill-usage of
Mrs Miller, I shall easily forgive what affects me only. I think your
goodness hath not deserved this indignity at her hands." "Well,
child," said Allworthy, "but what is this new instance? What hath he
done of late?" "What," cries Blifil, "notwithstanding all Mrs Miller
hath said, I am very sorry to relate, and what you should never have
heard from me, had it not been a matter impossible to conceal from the
whole world. In short he hath killed a man; I will not say
murdered--for perhaps it may not be so construed in law, and I hope
the best for his sake."

Allworthy looked shocked, and blessed himself; and then, turning to
Mrs Miller, he cried, "Well, madam, what say you now?"

"Why, I say, sir," answered she, "that I never was more concerned at
anything in my life; but, if the fact be true, I am convinced the man,
whoever he is, was in fault. Heaven knows there are many villains in
this town who make it their business to provoke young gentlemen.
Nothing but the greatest provocation could have tempted him; for of
all the gentlemen I ever had in my house, I never saw one so gentle or
so sweet-tempered. He was beloved by every one in the house, and every
one who came near it."

While she was thus running on, a violent knocking at the door
interrupted their conversation, and prevented her from proceeding
further, or from receiving any answer; for, as she concluded this was
a visitor to Mr Allworthy, she hastily retired, taking with her her
little girl, whose eyes were all over blubbered at the melancholy news
she heard of Jones, who used to call her his little wife, and not only
gave her many playthings, but spent whole hours in playing with her
himself.

Some readers may, perhaps, be pleased with these minute circumstances,
in relating of which we follow the example of Plutarch, one of the
best of our brother historians; and others, to whom they may appear
trivial, will, we hope, at least pardon them, as we are never prolix
on such occasions.



Chapter iii.

The arrival of Mr Western, with some matters concerning the paternal
authority.


Mrs Miller had not long left the room when Mr Western entered; but not
before a small wrangling bout had passed between him and his chairmen;
for the fellows, who had taken up their burden at the Hercules
Pillars, had conceived no hopes of having any future good customer in
the squire; and they were moreover farther encouraged by his
generosity (for he had given them of his own accord sixpence more than
their fare); they therefore very boldly demanded another shilling,
which so provoked the squire, that he not only bestowed many hearty
curses on them at the door, but retained his anger after he came into
the room; swearing that all the Londoners were like the court, and
thought of nothing but plundering country gentlemen. "D--n me," says
he, "if I won't walk in the rain rather than get into one of their
hand-barrows again. They have jolted me more in a mile than Brown Bess
would in a long fox-chase."

When his wrath on this occasion was a little appeased, he resumed the
same passionate tone on another. "There," says he, "there is fine
business forwards now. The hounds have changed at last; and when we
imagined we had a fox to deal with, od-rat it, it turns out to be a
badger at last!"

"Pray, my good neighbour," said Allworthy, "drop your metaphors, and
speak a little plainer." "Why, then," says the squire, "to tell you
plainly, we have been all this time afraid of a son of a whore of a
bastard of somebody's, I don't know whose, not I. And now here's a
confounded son of a whore of a lord, who may be a bastard too for what
I know or care, for he shall never have a daughter of mine by my
consent. They have beggared the nation, but they shall never beggar
me. My land shall never be sent over to Hanover."

"You surprize me much, my good friend," said Allworthy. "Why, zounds!
I am surprized myself," answered the squire. "I went to zee sister
Western last night, according to her own appointment, and there I was
had into a whole room full of women. There was my lady cousin
Bellaston, and my Lady Betty, and my Lady Catherine, and my lady I
don't know who; d--n me, if ever you catch me among such a kennel of
hoop-petticoat b--s! D--n me, I'd rather be run by my own dogs, as one
Acton was, that the story-book says was turned into a hare, and his
own dogs killed un and eat un. Od-rabbit it, no mortal was ever run in
such a manner; if I dodged one way, one had me; if I offered to clap
back, another snapped me. `O! certainly one of the greatest matches in
England,' says one cousin (here he attempted to mimic them); `A very
advantageous offer indeed,' cries another cousin (for you must know
they be all my cousins, thof I never zeed half o' um before).
`Surely,' says that fat a--se b--, my Lady Bellaston, `cousin, you
must be out of your wits to think of refusing such an offer.'"

"Now I begin to understand," says Allworthy; "some person hath made
proposals to Miss Western, which the ladies of the family approve, but
is not to your liking."

"My liking!" said Western, "how the devil should it? I tell you it is
a lord, and those are always volks whom you know I always resolved to
have nothing to do with. Did unt I refuse a matter of vorty years'
purchase now for a bit of land, which one o' um had a mind to put into
a park, only because I would have no dealings with lords, and dost
think I would marry my daughter zu? Besides, ben't I engaged to you,
and did I ever go off any bargain when I had promised?"

"As to that point, neighbour," said Allworthy, "I entirely release you
from any engagement. No contract can be binding between parties who
have not a full power to make it at the time, nor ever afterwards
acquire the power of fulfilling it."

"Slud! then," answered Western, "I tell you I have power, and I will
fulfil it. Come along with me directly to Doctors' Commons, I will get
a licence; and I will go to sister and take away the wench by force,
and she shall ha un, or I will lock her up, and keep her upon bread
and water as long as she lives."

"Mr Western," said Allworthy, "shall I beg you will hear my full
sentiments on this matter?"--"Hear thee; ay, to be sure I will,"
answered he. "Why, then, sir," cries Allworthy, "I can truly say,
without a compliment either to you or the young lady, that when this
match was proposed, I embraced it very readily and heartily, from my
regard to you both. An alliance between two families so nearly
neighbours, and between whom there had always existed so mutual an
intercourse and good harmony, I thought a most desirable event; and
with regard to the young lady, not only the concurrent opinion of all
who knew her, but my own observation assured me that she would be an
inestimable treasure to a good husband. I shall say nothing of her
personal qualifications, which certainly are admirable; her good
nature, her charitable disposition, her modesty, are too well known to
need any panegyric: but she hath one quality which existed in a high
degree in that best of women, who is now one of the first of angels,
which, as it is not of a glaring kind, more commonly escapes
observation; so little indeed is it remarked, that I want a word to
express it. I must use negatives on this occasion. I never heard
anything of pertness, or what is called repartee, out of her mouth; no
pretence to wit, much less to that kind of wisdom which is the result
only of great learning and experience, the affectation of which, in a
young woman, is as absurd as any of the affectations of an ape. No
dictatorial sentiments, no judicial opinions, no profound criticisms.
Whenever I have seen her in the company of men, she hath been all
attention, with the modesty of a learner, not the forwardness of a
teacher. You'll pardon me for it, but I once, to try her only, desired
her opinion on a point which was controverted between Mr Thwackum and
Mr Square. To which she answered, with much sweetness, `You will
pardon me, good Mr Allworthy; I am sure you cannot in earnest think me
capable of deciding any point in which two such gentlemen disagree.'
Thwackum and Square, who both alike thought themselves sure of a
favourable decision, seconded my request. She answered with the same
good humour, `I must absolutely be excused: for I will affront neither
so much as to give my judgment on his side.' Indeed, she always shewed
the highest deference to the understandings of men; a quality
absolutely essential to the making a good wife. I shall only add, that
as she is most apparently void of all affectation, this deference must
be certainly real."

Here Blifil sighed bitterly; upon which Western, whose eyes were full
of tears at the praise of Sophia, blubbered out, "Don't be
chicken-hearted, for shat ha her, d--n me, shat ha her, if she was
twenty times as good."

"Remember your promise, sir," cried Allworthy, "I was not to be
interrupted." "Well, shat unt," answered the squire; "I won't speak
another word."

"Now, my good friend," continued Allworthy, "I have dwelt so long on
the merit of this young lady, partly as I really am in love with her
character, and partly that fortune (for the match in that light is
really advantageous on my nephew's side) might not be imagined to be
my principal view in having so eagerly embraced the proposal. Indeed,
I heartily wished to receive so great a jewel into my family; but
though I may wish for many good things, I would not, therefore, steal
them, or be guilty of any violence or injustice to possess myself of
them. Now to force a woman into a marriage contrary to her consent or
approbation, is an act of such injustice and oppression, that I wish
the laws of our country could restrain it; but a good conscience is
never lawless in the worst regulated state, and will provide those
laws for itself, which the neglect of legislators hath forgotten to
supply. This is surely a case of that kind; for, is it not cruel, nay,
impious, to force a woman into that state against her will; for her
behaviour in which she is to be accountable to the highest and most
dreadful court of judicature, and to answer at the peril of her soul?
To discharge the matrimonial duties in an adequate manner is no easy
task; and shall we lay this burthen upon a woman, while we at the same
time deprive her of all that assistance which may enable her to
undergo it? Shall we tear her very heart from her, while we enjoin her
duties to which a whole heart is scarce equal? I must speak very
plainly here. I think parents who act in this manner are accessories
to all the guilt which their children afterwards incur, and of course
must, before a just judge, expect to partake of their punishment; but
if they could avoid this, good heaven! is there a soul who can bear
the thought of having contributed to the damnation of his child?

"For these reasons, my best neighbour, as I see the inclinations of
this young lady are most unhappily averse to my nephew, I must decline
any further thoughts of the honour you intended him, though I assure
you I shall always retain the most grateful sense of it."

"Well, sir," said Western (the froth bursting forth from his lips the
moment they were uncorked), "you cannot say but I have heard you out,
and now I expect you'll hear me; and if I don't answer every word
on't, why then I'll consent to gee the matter up. First then, I
desire you to answer me one question--Did not I beget her? did not I
beget her? answer me that. They say, indeed, it is a wise father that
knows his own child; but I am sure I have the best title to her, for
I bred her up. But I believe you will allow me to be her father, and
if I be, am I not to govern my own child? I ask you that, am I not to
govern my own child? and if I am to govern her in other matters,
surely I am to govern her in this, which concerns her most. And what
am I desiring all this while? Am I desiring her to do anything for
me? to give me anything?--Zu much on t'other side, that I am only
desiring her to take away half my estate now, and t'other half when I
die. Well, and what is it all vor? Why, is unt it to make her happy?
It's enough to make one mad to hear volks talk; if I was going to
marry myself, then she would ha reason to cry and to blubber; but, on
the contrary, han't I offered to bind down my land in such a manner,
that I could not marry if I would, seeing as narro' woman upon earth
would ha me. What the devil in hell can I do more? I contribute to
her damnation!--Zounds! I'd zee all the world d--n'd bevore her
little vinger should be hurt. Indeed, Mr Allworthy, you must excuse
me, but I am surprized to hear you talk in zuch a manner, and I must
say, take it how you will, that I thought you had more sense."

Allworthy resented this reflection only with a smile; nor could he, if
he would have endeavoured it, have conveyed into that smile any
mixture of malice or contempt. His smiles at folly were indeed such as
we may suppose the angels bestow on the absurdities of mankind.

Blifil now desired to be permitted to speak a few words. "As to using
any violence on the young lady, I am sure I shall never consent to it.
My conscience will not permit me to use violence on any one, much less
on a lady for whom, however cruel she is to me, I shall always
preserve the purest and sincerest affection; but yet I have read that
women are seldom proof against perseverance. Why may I not hope then
by such perseverance at last to gain those inclinations, in which for
the future I shall, perhaps, have no rival; for as for this lord, Mr
Western is so kind to prefer me to him; and sure, sir, you will not
deny but that a parent hath at least a negative voice in these
matters; nay, I have heard this very young lady herself say so more
than once, and declare that she thought children inexcusable who
married in direct opposition to the will of their parents. Besides,
though the other ladies of the family seem to favour the pretensions
of my lord, I do not find the lady herself is inclined to give him any
countenance; alas! I am too well assured she is not; I am too sensible
that wickedest of men remains uppermost in her heart."

"Ay, ay, so he does," cries Western.

"But surely," says Blifil, "when she hears of this murder which he
hath committed, if the law should spare his life----"

"What's that?" cries Western. "Murder! hath he committed a murder, and
is there any hopes of seeing him hanged?--Tol de rol, tol lol de rol."
Here he fell a singing and capering about the room.

"Child," says Allworthy, "this unhappy passion of yours distresses me
beyond measure. I heartily pity you, and would do every fair thing to
promote your success."

"I desire no more," cries Blifil; "I am convinced my dear uncle hath a
better opinion of me than to think that I myself would accept of
more."

"Lookee," says Allworthy, "you have my leave to write, to visit, if
she will permit it--but I insist on no thoughts of violence. I will
hr husband as if he had
himself joined their hands.

In this situation were affairs when Mr Allworthy and his company
arrived to complete the happiness of Mrs Miller, who no sooner saw
Sophia than she guessed everything that had happened; and so great was
her friendship to Jones, that it added not a few transports to those
she felt on the happiness of her own daughter.

There have not, I believe, been many instances of a number of people
met together, where every one was so perfectly happy as in this
company. Amongst whom the father of young Nightingale enjoyed the
least perfect content; for, notwithstanding his affection for his son,
notwithstanding the authority and the arguments of Allworthy, together
with the other motive mentioned before, he could not so entirely be
satisfied with his son's choice; and, perhaps, the presence of Sophia
herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern, as a
thought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that
lady, or some other such. Not that any of the charms which adorned
either the person or mind of Sophia created the uneasiness; it was the
contents of her father's coffers which set his heart a longing. These
were the charms which he could not bear to think his son had
sacrificed to the daughter of Mrs Miller.

The brides were both very pretty women; but so totally were they
eclipsed by the beauty of Sophia, that, had they not been two of the
best-tempered girls in the world, it would have raised some envy in
their breasts; for neither of their husbands could long keep his eyes
from Sophia, who sat at the table like a queen receiving homage, or,
rather, like a superior being receiving adoration from all around her.
But it was an adoration which they gave, not which she exacted; for
she was as much distinguished by her modesty and affability as by all
her other perfections.

The evening was spent in much true mirth. All were happy, but those
the most who had been most unhappy before. Their former sufferings and
fears gave such a relish to their felicity as even love and fortune,
in their fullest flow, could not have given without the advantage of
such a comparison. Yet, as great joy, especially after a sudden change
and revolution of circumstances, is apt to be silent, and dwells
rather in the heart than on the tongue, Jones and Sophia appeared the
least merry of the whole company; which Western observed with great
impatience, often crying out to them, "Why dost not talk, boy? Why
dost look so grave? Hast lost thy tongue, girl? Drink another glass of
wine; sha't drink another glass." And, the more to enliven her, he
would sometimes sing a merry song, which bore some relation to
matrimony and the loss of a maidenhead. Nay, he would have proceeded
so far on that topic as to have driven her out of the room, if Mr
Allworthy had not checkt him, sometimes by looks, and once or twice by
a "Fie! Mr Western!" He began, indeed, once to debate the matter, and
assert his right to talk to his own daughter as he thought fit; but,
as nobody seconded him, he was soon reduced to order.

Notwithstanding this little restraint, he was so pleased with the
chearfulness and good-humour of the company, that he insisted on their
meeting the next day at his lodgings. They all did so; and the lovely
Sophia, who was now in private become a bride too, officiated as the
mistress of the ceremonies, or, in the polite phrase, did the honours
of the table. She had that morning given her hand to Jones, in the
chapel at Doctors'-Commons, where Mr Allworthy, Mr Western, and Mrs
Miller, were the only persons present.

Sophia had earnestly desired her father that no others of the company,
who were that day to dine with him, should be acquainted with her
marriage. The same secrecy was enjoined to Mrs Miller, and Jones
undertook for Allworthy. This somewhat reconciled the delicacy of
Sophia to the public entertainment which, in compliance with her
father's will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against her own
inclinations. In confidence of this secrecy she went through the day
pretty well, till the squire, who was now advanced into the second
bottle, could contain his joy no longer, but, filling out a bumper,
drank a health to the bride. The health was immediately pledged by all
present, to the great confusion of our poor blushing Sophia, and the
great concern of Jones upon her account. To say truth, there was not a
person present made wiser by this discovery; for Mrs Miller had
whispered it to her daughter, her daughter to her husband, her husband
to his sister, and she to all the rest.

Sophia now took the first opportunity of withdrawing with the ladies,
and the squire sat in to his cups, in which he was, by degrees,
deserted by all the company except the uncle of young Nightingale, who
loved his bottle as well as Western himself. These two, therefore, sat
stoutly to it during the whole evening, and long after that happy hour
which had surrendered the charming Sophia to the eager arms of her
enraptured Jones.

Thus, reader, we have at length brought our history to a conclusion,
in which, to our great pleasure, though contrary, perhaps, to thy
expectation, Mr Jones appears to be the happiest of all humankind; for
what happiness this world affords equal to the possession of such a
woman as Sophia, I sincerely own I have never yet discovered.

As to the other persons who have made any considerable figure in this
history, as some may desire to know a little more concerning them, we
will proceed, in as few words as possible, to satisfy their curiosity.

Allworthy hath never yet been prevailed upon to see Blifil, but he
hath yielded to the importunity of Jones, backed by Sophia, to settle
£200 a-year upon him; to which Jones hath privately added a third.
Upon this income he lives in one of the northern counties, about 200
miles distant from London, and lays up £200 a-year out of it, in order
to purchase a seat in the next parliament from a neighbouring borough,
which he has bargained for with an attourney there. He is also lately
turned Methodist, in hopes of marrying a very rich widow of that sect,
whose estate lies in that part of the kingdom.

Square died soon after he writ the before-mentioned letter; and as to
Thwackum, he continues at his vicarage. He hath made many fruitless
attempts to regain the confidence of Allworthy, or to ingratiate
himself with Jones, both of whom he flatters to their faces, and
abuses behind their backs. But in his stead, Mr Allworthy hath lately
taken Mr Abraham Adams into his house, of whom Sophia is grown
immoderately fond, and declares he shall have the tuition of her
children.

Mrs Fitzpatrick is separated from her husband, and retains the little
remains of her fortune. She lives in reputation at the polite end of
the town, and is so good an economist, that she spends three times
the income of her fortune, without running into debt. She maintains a
perfect intimacy with the lady of the Irish peer; and in acts of
friendship to her repays all obligations she owes her husband.

Mrs Western was soon reconciled to her niece Sophia, and hath spent
two months together with her in the country. Lady Bellaston made the
latter a formal visit at her return to town, where she behaved to
Jones as a perfect stranger, and, with great civility, wished him joy
on his marriage.

Mr Nightingale hath purchased an estate for his son in the
neighbourhood of Jones, where the young gentleman, his lady, Mrs
Miller, and her little daughter reside, and the most agreeable
intercourse subsists between the two families.

As to those of lower account, Mrs Waters returned into the country,
had a pension of £60 a-year settled upon her by Mr Allworthy, and is
married to Parson Supple, on whom, at the instance of Sophia, Western
hath bestowed a considerable living.

Black George, hearing the discovery that had been made, ran away, and
was never since heard of; and Jones bestowed the money on his family,
but not in equal proportions, for Molly had much the greatest share.

As for Partridge, Jones hath settled £50 a-year on him; and he hath
again set up a school, in which he meets with much better
encouragement than formerly, and there is now a treaty of marriage on
foot between him and Miss Molly Seagrim, which, through the mediation
of Sophia, is likely to take effect.

We now return to take leave of Mr Jones and Sophia, who, within two
days after their marriage, attended Mr Western and Mr Allworthy into
the country. Western hath resigned his family seat, and the greater
part of his estate, to his son-in-law, and hath retired to a lesser
house of his in another part of the country, which is better for
hunting. Indeed, he is often as a visitant with Mr Jones, who, as well
as his daughter, hath an infinite delight in doing everything in their
power to please him. And this desire of theirs is attended with such
success, that the old gentleman declares he was never happy in his
life till now. He hath here a parlour and ante-chamber to himself,
where he gets drunk with whom he pleases: and his daughter is still as
ready as formerly to play to him whenever he desires it; for Jones
hath assured her that, as, next to pleasing her, one of his highest
satisfactions is to contribute to the happiness of the old man; so,
the great duty which she expresses and performs to her father, renders
her almost equally dear to him with the love which she bestows on
himself.

Sophia hath already produced him two fine children, a boy and a girl,
of whom the old gentleman is so fond, that he spends much of his time
in the nursery, where he declares the tattling of his little
grand-daughter, who is above a year and a half old, is sweeter music
than the finest cry of dogs in England.

Allworthy was likewise greatly liberal to Jones on the marriage, and
hath omitted no instance of shewing his affection to him and his lady,
who love him as a father. Whatever in the nature of Jones had a
tendency to vice, has been corrected by continual conversation with
this good man, and by his union with the lovely and virtuous Sophia.
He hath also, by reflection on his past follies, acquired a discretion
and prudence very uncommon in one of his lively parts.

To conclude, as there are not to be found a worthier man and woman,
than this fond couple, so neither can any be imagined more happy. They
preserve the purest and tenderest affection for each other, an
affection daily encreased and confirmed by mutual endearments and
mutual esteem. Nor is their conduct towards their relations and
friends less amiable than towards one another. And such is their
condescension, their indulgence, and their beneficence to those below
them, that there is not a neighbour, a tenant, or a servant, who doth
not most gratefully bless the day when Mr Jones was married to his
Sophia.



_FINIS_.
