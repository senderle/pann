This is the README I added because github told me I needed a README!

My goal is to create an application for training feed forward networks on 
large quantitites of data. Right now it can handle several million training
instances in a reasonable way. I want it to handle several hundred million, 
and to train across multiple computers in a cluster. Those goals are a bit 
more challenging! But this already deals with interesting, mid-size problems
pretty well. It's able to train a decent character-level language model in a 
week. It's not as good as this:

But it produces some pretty reasonable word sequences, and since I don't
know how to write a Hessian free optimizer (yet!) I think it's good enough
for now. 

If you use this, get in touch! I'd love to work on making this as feature-
complete as possible, but I don't know what would be useful to others.
